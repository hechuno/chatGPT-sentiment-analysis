Real_1-Webpage,Another Terrorist Attack in NYC…Why Are we STILL Being Politically Correct – Eagle Rising,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

On the evening of September 17, 2016, New York City's Chelsea neighborhood became the epicenter of a harrowing explosion at approximately 8:30 PM EST. The blast, which originated from a homemade bomb strategically positioned in a dumpster on West 23rd Street, left 29 individuals injured, although fortunately, no fatalities were reported. The explosion led to significant street closures in the area as emergency responders rushed to the scene.

In the immediate aftermath, local authorities secured the area. In the early hours of the following day, the police removed the explosive device for further analysis. This decisive action underscored the urgency of uncovering the details surrounding the incident. 

Not far from the initial explosion site, law enforcement officials discovered a second device, later described as a ""pressure cooker"" bomb, on West 27th Street. The discovery of this additional explosive fueled concerns regarding the intentions of the perpetrator and underscored the necessity for heightened vigilance in urban settings.

By Sunday morning, all individuals who suffered injuries during the explosion were released from the hospital, bringing a small measure of relief to the community amidst the chaotic aftermath. This incident came on the heels of a similar bombing in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, which occurred during a charity race, though that event thankfully resulted in no injuries.

Law enforcement officials quickly connected the dots between the two separate incidents, revealing that both explosions were traced back to the same individual. The situation raised serious concerns regarding the implications for public safety in densely populated urban areas, as well as the motivations behind such attacks.

As discussions around the incidents unfolded, there emerged a palpable sensitivity concerning the labeling of these acts. A possible caution around political correctness became evident among various officials, who navigated the complex landscape of terminology related to terrorism. New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio maintained that, while the act was intentional, there was no specific threat from known terror organizations at that point in time. 

Contrastingly, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo characterized the explosion as an act of terrorism, despite acknowledging a lack of solid evidence linking the attack to international militant groups. His words ignited a broader discourse about the nature of domestic terrorism and the growing need for effective measures to combat it.

In the realm of politics, presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump issued statements in response to the incident, each reflecting their respective campaign positions. Clinton emphasized the importance of providing support for first responders, underscoring a commitment to community resilience in the face of adversity. On the other hand, Trump focused on the urgency of implementing tougher security measures, resonating with a segment of the electorate concerned about national security.

Amidst the unfolding political conversation, an opinion piece emerged, articulating the sentiment of vulnerability felt across the United States. The author called for strong leadership in addressing the threats posed by terrorism, urging leaders to take decisive action without political hesitation. This commentary echoed the broader anxieties of citizens, who seek reassurance that their safety is a priority amid the backdrop of global uncertainty.

As the investigation into the bombing in Chelsea continues, the aftermath of the attack raises critical questions about the resilience of urban communities in the face of such terrifying acts. The juxtaposition of local incidents with larger national narratives about security, safety, and political correctness underscores a complex reality that requires a balanced and responsive approach from both law enforcement and political leaders.

In conclusion, the events that unfolded on West 23rd and West 27th Streets in Manhattan serve as a stark reminder of the challenges faced within urban centers regarding public safety. As details emerge and individuals reflect on their experiences during this traumatic incident, the need for an effective dialogue on terrorism, community safety, and political response remains crucial. The community of Chelsea stands resilient, though it must navigate the delicate balance between ensuring safety and remaining vigilant in confronting the realities of potential threats in the future.",-43.0,-7.0,930.0,-1.2285714285714286,-0.046236559139784944,752.0,-0.25,-0.009308510638297872
Real_10-Webpage,"Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests","Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.

""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.

The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.

""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""

He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.

""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""

But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.

Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.

During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""

Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.

Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.

""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.

In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",http://abcn.ws/2d4lNn9,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg,"More Candace,Adam Kelsey,Abc News,More Adam",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437,"{""fb_title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@adam_kels"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-22"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-22"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-22 14:33:00"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh""}","- Protests erupted in North Carolina following the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man.

Charlotte, NC - The city of Charlotte is reeling from a wave of protests following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man whose death has ignited tensions and drawn attention to systemic issues regarding law enforcement and community relations. The protests have seen significant confrontations with officers in riot gear, escalating to the use of tear gas to control the crowds. Amid the unrest, one individual was reported to be in critical condition due to a gunshot wound sustained during the chaos.

In response to the violent turn of events, Donald Trump addressed the crowd at the Shale Insight 2016 Conference, attributing part of the blame for such violence to drugs. His remarks came amid a backdrop of passionate protests calling for justice and accountability in the wake of Scott's killing. Trump denounced the violence that emerged out of the protests and appealed for national unity, stating that the nation should be an example of leadership to the world.

While Trump praised law enforcement for facing challenges in their line of duty, his speech also touched on the need for better training and accountability for police misconduct. However, notable was his lack of acknowledgment of the systemic violence faced by African-Americans at the hands of police, an issue that is at the core of many protesters’ demands for justice.

In his recent messages aimed at black Americans, Trump has questioned what they have to lose by casting their votes for him, framing a narrative that asserts African-American communities are in a state of struggle. While he paints this picture of hardship, data contradicts general assertions about black poverty in America, revealing that over half of black Americans over the age of 25 hold college degrees, with many not living under poverty lines.

Further complicating his outreach, Trump had previously visited a black church in Cleveland where he advocated for stop-and-frisk policies, later clarifying that his comments were aimed specifically at the context of Chicago. This approach elicited mixed reactions, as he attempted to navigate the intricate dynamics between law enforcement and African-American communities.

During his addresses, Trump made a distinction between what he referred to as ""violent disruptors"" inciting chaos in the streets and the wider black community, seeking to position himself as a supporter of improved conditions for African-American families and educational opportunities. His comments aim to resonate with a demographic that has increasingly expressed discontent with existing systemic issues.

As protesters continue to rally in Charlotte and express their frustration over matters related to police brutality and racial injustice, the city stands as a vivid backdrop for dialogue on race relations in America. The killing of Keith Lamont Scott has not only catapulted the community's grievances to the forefront but also reignited national conversations around law enforcement practices and racial disparities.

As the situation unfolds, the call for reforms within law enforcement remains strong, with activists and community leaders emphasizing the urgent need to address the systemic inequities that plague African-American communities. The recent protests are a reflection of a deeper societal unrest—a cry for change and accountability that many advocates hope will be heard by those in positions of power.

While Trump’s speech may have aimed to provide a calming response amid the unrest, it signals a continuing division and challenge in articulating a comprehensive narrative that acknowledges the realities faced by African-Americans in relation to law enforcement. As the debates around policies and reforms continue, Charlotte’s protests shine a light on the pressing need for dialogue and changes within the system.

The outpourings of grief and anger from the community highlight the ongoing sense of urgency around issues of race, justice, and accountability. For many, the conversation initiated by the tragic death of Keith Lamont Scott is far from over; it is a call to action that transcends local protests, reaching into national discussions around race, policing, and the future of public safety in America.

As Charlotte remains at the epicenter of these critical discussions, the eyes of the nation will remain focused on the protests and the policies that may emerge in their wake. The collective demands for justice highlight the importance of listening to the voices calling for systemic changes that reflect a more equitable society for all Americans.",-51.0,-43.0,768.0,-1.7,-0.06640625,789.0,-1.7916666666666667,-0.05449936628643853

Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.

Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”

So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.

Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.

How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right? Obama has an agenda to push.",http://rightwingnews.com/barack-obama/obama-un-giving-liberty-enhances-security-america/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/obama-un.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474476044000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/ji6pl5Vwrvk,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/obama-un.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/obama-un-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ZObama.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/barack-obama/obama-un-giving-liberty-enhances-security-america/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon.

In an address delivered at the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama made a compelling case for the necessity of balancing liberty and security in an increasingly complex global landscape. His remarks underscored the idea that in order to face modern challenges, nations must be willing to accept certain constraints on their sovereignty, promoting an environment of cooperation and adherence to international norms.

Obama asserted that powerful nations, particularly, bear a significant responsibility in fostering a global order that prioritizes collective security. He argued that the path to progress often involves relinquishing some degree of freedom; however, he was careful to clarify that this does not imply a jeopardization of national security or essential national interests. This nuanced perspective suggests that with mutual concessions among nations, there could be opportunities for enhanced security cooperation, which ultimately benefits not just individual nations, but the global community as a whole.

A particular focus of Obama's address was on the plight of nations burdened by a significant influx of refugees. He advocated for the need to support countries that are shouldering the humanitarian impact of large refugee populations, framing this as a necessary strategy for bolstering global stability. The former president highlighted that by aiding those nations, the international community not only fulfills its moral obligations but also contributes positively to global security. 

However, the discussion around refugee resettlement was met with criticism and concern. Opponents raised alarms about the safety implications of accepting numerous refugees, particularly without a thorough vetting process. Detractors pointed to examples from Germany, where the influx of refugees has stirred public debate and uncertainty, and referenced recent terrorist attacks in the U.S. as evidence of the potential risks associated with insufficiently screened immigration policies.

The push for a more open stance on refugees is seen by some as part of a broader liberal agenda, raising questions about the implications for American freedoms and constitutional rights. Critics argue that this approach might pose risks to the safety and security of U.S. citizens, suggesting that the trade-off between welcoming refugees and ensuring domestic stability is fraught with peril. The anxiety surrounding this issue highlights a fundamental tension in contemporary governance: the balance between humanitarian responsibilities and national security.

In the context of Obama’s address, the juxtaposition of his visions for collaboration and the concerns voiced by critics illuminates a significant dilemma facing modern political leadership. While the former president’s arguments make a case for collective action in the face of adversity, they also serve to galvanize an important conversation about how societies should navigate the balance between openness and safety.

As discussions in the wake of the assembly unfold, it becomes clear that Obama's insights will continue to provoke debate on the legitimacy of freedom trade-offs in the name of security. With a diverse array of opinions on the matter, the dialogue surrounding international cooperation, refugee support, and national security is likely to evolve. 

Ultimately, as powerful nations confront the realities of a rapidly changing world, the challenge remains: how to cultivate a secure environment while honoring the freedoms that define democratic societies. With Obama’s address as a historical touchstone, the path forward will require careful deliberation and a commitment to finding common ground amidst divergent perspectives.",23.0,31.0,576.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03993055555555555,611.0,1.55,0.05073649754500818
Real_12-Webpage,Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works,"Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump’s vision.

As he made clear once again in Monday night’s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.”

Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ‘I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “Incomes went up for everybody.”

Story Continued Below

That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “My whole life is about winning. … I always win,” Trump says in explaining why he’s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “Winning the Global Competition.” You don’t get more zero-sum than that.

Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–Trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.

The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.

Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.

No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan’s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.

Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.

Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.

The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders’ powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.

Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. They aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.

We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, two distinct visions of the economy have emerged, starkly contrasting the philosophies of former President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump envisions the economic landscape as a zero-sum game, where one party’s gain directly translates to another’s loss. This perspective, deeply embedded in his competitive campaign ethos, suggests that America is in a relentless battle against other nations, in which winning requires defeating adversaries. Conversely, Clinton advocates for an economic model that emphasizes growth and shared prosperity, asserting that the economy can expand to benefit all citizens—a vision rooted in her husband Bill Clinton’s presidency and the earlier pro-globalization stance symbolized by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

During a recent debate, Trump voiced his criticism of the NAFTA trade deal, positioning it as detrimental to American manufacturing. He expressed a belief that the United States is being outpaced by other countries, thus framing economic relations as inherently adversarial. His emphasis on “winning” resonates with an electorate that is increasingly discontented with economic transitions that often leave individuals feeling excluded or worse off than before. This perception of economy as a battleground fuels support for his candidacy from those who feel threatened by globalization or left behind by the shifting economic landscape. 

On the other side, Clinton’s approach strikes a chord with various demographics, particularly those thriving in large metropolitan areas, especially along the coasts. Her narrative of opportunity is tailored to those who recognize an interconnected economic reality where growth is possible for all, rather than a simplistic contest. By referencing the previous administration’s successes during her husband’s presidency, Clinton aligns herself with the ideals of shared growth and beneficence that fundamental economic institutions can provide. This clash of ideologies has led the electorate to become increasingly polarized, with zero-sum thinkers like Trump appealing to voters who see their own economic status as precarious in a competitive global economy.

The disagreement between these two visions reflects a broader divide within the electorate, evidenced by the recent Census Report that indicated a median income increase. While the statistics suggest an overall improvement, the lived experiences of many Americans reveal a stark disparity; countless individuals grapple with economic insecurity, feeling detached from the narratives of rising prosperity. This misalignment between data and personal experience underlines the complexity of the economy—something that economists generally recognize as being far from a zero-sum scenario. They assert that improvements in welfare can be achieved through collective growth, contradicting Trump’s combative approach.

Within this conversation, it is essential to note the broader historical context of political discontent in America. The current sentiment parallels the Progressive Movement era of the early 20th century, characterized by concerns over inequality and a widespread desire for reform. The frustration stemming from current economic structures mirrors these past movements, indicating deep-seated issues that defy simple interpretations or solutions. 

While Trump garners support from certain business sectors and Wall Street leaders who appreciate his combative worldview, this support does not necessarily translate into substantial financial backing for his campaign. Their alignment suggests a recognition of the zero-sum mentality that Trump offers, even if this model overlooks the holistic effects of economic policies on broader populations. Economists supporting the liberal internationalist order argue for fostering a global middle class through open markets and a commitment to globalization; however, these proponents often neglect the profound challenges experienced by those adversely affected by these same economic changes.

As the election nears, the dynamics of these contrasting visions will play a significant role in shaping voter preferences and influencing the potential outcome. Historical patterns indicate that zero-sum approaches may not lead to a collective affluence that promotes shared success across the socioeconomic spectrum. A successful economy, one that engages all citizens and fosters long-term health, ultimately thrives on openness, education, and innovation rather than a superficial winner-loser mentality.

As both candidates continue to campaign vigorously, their differing narratives will resonate within various demographics, potentially altering the political landscape. Voters will face the choice of an economy perceived as a battlefield versus one that aims for collective benefit, a decision that will shape both policy and the future wellbeing of the country for years to come. The uncertainty surrounding this election underscores the critical juncture at which the American electorate finds itself, where differing perspectives on economic realization bind or divide the nation as it heads into critical decisions that will define its path forward.",72.0,56.0,1571.0,1.3333333333333333,0.04583068109484405,840.0,2.0,0.06666666666666667
Real_13-Webpage,"President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill, Setting Up Showdown With Congress","President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

“I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message.

“I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”

The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.

Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.

The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.

If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.

Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.

""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.

""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.""

But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.

In a significant move reflecting a complex intersection of justice and international diplomacy, President Obama has vetoed the 'Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act' (JASTA), a bill that would enable survivors of the September 11 attacks and the families of victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for damages. The veto has ignited a fierce debate over the balance between pursuing justice for victims and maintaining vital international relationships.

In his veto message, President Obama expressed deep sympathy for the families affected by the 9/11 attacks, emphasizing his ongoing commitment to their quest for justice. However, he cautioned that the legislation could have far-reaching implications for U.S. foreign relations and the foundational legal concept of sovereign immunity. The veto follows a robust display of bipartisan support in Congress, where the bill was overwhelmingly approved, marking a rare moment of unity on such a contentious issue. 

If enacted, JASTA would pave the way for victims of terrorism to bring lawsuits against foreign governments, a significant shift in legal precedent that the White House argues could lead to reciprocal actions from other nations, placing U.S. interests at risk. In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest warned that overriding the veto could have detrimental effects on U.S. relations not only with Saudi Arabia but with various countries worldwide that may feel similarly threatened by such legal vulnerabilities.

The notion of pursuing justice through litigation has gained significant traction among many families of the 9/11 victims, who have long felt that they have received insufficient accountability for the atrocities committed against them. They argue that seeking legal redress from Saudi Arabia is a necessary step in holding accountable those they believe are complicit in fostering the circumstances of the attacks. Despite their claims of innocence, Saudi Arabia has consistently denied any involvement in orchestrating the events of September 11, adding to the complexity of the situation.

While the bill stands at a pivotal moment, the path to overriding President Obama’s veto is challenging. Both the House and Senate passed the bill unanimously, yet achieving the necessary two-thirds majority in both chambers for a successful override remains uncertain. The Obama administration is actively lobbying to consolidate Democratic votes in an effort to thwart an override that could change the legislative landscape regarding foreign state accountability in terrorism-related claims.

Political leaders from across the spectrum are weighing in on the ramifications of this pivotal legislative moment. Notably, Hillary Clinton, who served as Secretary of State under President Obama, announced her support for the legislation, indicating that if elected president, she would prioritize moves toward justice for the families of 9/11 victims. Her statement underscores the potential for shifting political dynamics surrounding the issue, particularly in the context of the upcoming election cycle.

As this situation evolves, it raises critical questions about the interplay between justice for victims and the realities of international relations. The decision to veto JASTA reflects a cautious approach to foreign policy that takes into consideration not only the immediate emotional cry for justice but also the long-term consequences of legal actions that may potentially destabilize existing diplomatic ties. As discussions continue, both proponents and opponents of the legislation prepare for the next steps in what has already become a pivotal moment in U.S. legal and foreign policy.",-7.0,-4.0,550.0,-0.4375,-0.012727272727272728,610.0,-0.21052631578947367,-0.006557377049180328

There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.

The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.

It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474473199000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUv7x5bXV4,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/riot.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice.

In a troubling development, a protest in North Carolina has escalated into violence involving activists from the Black Lives Matter movement. Initially gathering to voice their anger over the shooting of a Black man on a nearby highway, the demonstration soon devolved into chaos, prompting serious concerns regarding the actions and impact of the protesters involved.

During the demonstration, protesters began hurling rocks at vehicles, an act that not only endangered motorists but also shifted public perception of the movement itself. Eyewitness accounts and media footage captured the alarming scene, where a female truck driver found herself ambushed and subjected to a harrowing experience. While she was in her truck, protesters looted her vehicle and set its contents ablaze, symbolizing a volatile breakdown in civility and the rule of law. Disturbingly, when the driver called for police assistance, she was met with silence, as law enforcement reportedly did not respond to her cries for help.

As the night unfolded, the situation worsened dramatically. A media helicopter documented the further descent into chaos, illustrating the escalation of violence that was unfolding on the ground. By the time the dust began to settle, reports confirmed that 16 police officers had sustained injuries during the protests, and authorities were forced to shut down the freeway entirely in an attempt to regain control of the situation.

Critics of the protest have expressed deep concern over the actions taken by the demonstrators, labeling the event not as a peaceful display of dissent but rather as a destructive riot. Such criticism underscores the detrimental impact of violent protests on the broader objectives of the Black Lives Matter movement. Instead of fostering understanding and compassion, activities rooted in violence only serve to inflame existing racial tensions and contradict the ideals of peaceful protest championed by historical civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr.

The article argues that the principles of non-violence and unity, which have been at the core of many successful protest movements, appear to have been overshadowed by actions that promote division. The use of destructive behaviors not only alienates potential allies but also undermines the very message that supporters wish to communicate. Rather than bringing communities together for necessary discussions about race and justice, such behaviors create an atmosphere of fear and resentment.

Additionally, the criticism extends to the overall approach and strategies employed by the Black Lives Matter movement in light of recent events. By resorting to violence, the movement risks being perceived as a group that fosters division, rather than the unity and equality it purports to champion. This is concerning for those who wish to see genuine progress and reconciliation across racial lines.

The events in North Carolina serve as a stark reminder of the delicate balance between peaceful protest and the potential for violence to overshadow important social issues. As communities and leaders reflect on these occurrences, the challenge remains to find ways to express anger and demand justice without resorting to actions that can ultimately hinder the very cause being advocated for. The hope is for a return to the principles that allow for constructive dialogue and solidarity, paving the way for true progress in the pursuit of racial equality.",-44.0,-48.0,572.0,-1.6296296296296295,-0.07692307692307693,597.0,-2.2857142857142856,-0.08040201005025126
Real_15-Webpage,10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.

The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.

Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:

1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.

When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.

Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.”

He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.

2. Personal Attacks Came Early

Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker.

Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics.

“For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.

3. Trading Barbs Over Trade

Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.

“And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said.

Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”

Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.”

“Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said.

Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”

4. Trump Asks ‘Why Not’ Blame All the World’s Problems on Clinton

Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.”

Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?”

Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“

Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""

5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns

Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.

“I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.

Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said.

“I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?

“Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.

6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage

Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.

At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate.

Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015.

“Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”

7. Clinton Defends Being ‘Prepared’ When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail

Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff.

""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.”

Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.

8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion

Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.

“Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said.

Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.”

“They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal.

Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.

9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope

Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.

“I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”

Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.”

The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?""

Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.”

Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”

10. Sparring Over Stamina

Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.”

""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.”

Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.

""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said.

She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:

In a highly anticipated political showdown, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump faced each other in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in New York. The atmosphere was electric as both candidates took the stage, showcasing a mix of civility and contention that has come to define this election season.

The debate kicked off with what appeared to be a cordial handshake between the two candidates, but the veneer quickly faded as sarcasm and mutual contempt emerged. This initial interaction set the stage for the intense exchanges that characterized the evening, as both candidates aimed to assert their positions while undermining their opponent.

Clinton seized an early opportunity to cast doubt on Trump’s business background. She alleged that he received a substantial $14 million loan from his father to kickstart his business endeavors. This accusation highlighted the theme of privilege versus merit that has been a cornerstone of her campaign. In response, Trump downplayed the significance of the loan, asserting that he successfully built a large and thriving company from that initial investment. His defense aimed to position himself as a self-made businessman, countering Clinton's claims.

As the debate progressed, the candidates tackled more nuanced policy issues, including the contentious Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Trump accused Clinton of having previously supported the agreement, framing her stance as inconsistent. The tension in this exchange underscored the broader narrative of economic leadership, with both candidates seeking to appeal to voters concerned about trade's impact on American jobs.

Adding a touch of humor to the debate, Trump quipped that he would be the one blamed for all of America’s problems, to which Clinton sarcastically agreed, highlighting the distinct styles and tactics both candidates employed in their rhetoric. This moment played into the ongoing dialogue about accountability in leadership, as they both navigated serious topics with moments of levity.

Controversy further brewed as Trump defended his refusal to release his tax returns. He countered the mounting pressure for transparency by suggesting that his tax information would be disclosed only after Clinton released her deleted emails from her time as Secretary of State. This remark emphasized the ongoing scrutiny both candidates face regarding their past decisions and practices, reflecting a keen awareness of the importance of public perception in this election.

As the debate unfolded, Trump was questioned regarding his acknowledgment of President Obama’s birthplace. This topic has historically been a point of contention, and the query brought back memories of Trump's role in promoting the baseless ""birther"" conspiracy. The response was a tension-filled moment that showcased Trump's combative style when addressing his critics.

Clinton, unfazed by the exchanges, staunchly defended her debate preparations, arguing that readiness for such a vital role as presidency is paramount. Her stance highlighted her commitment to a well-prepared administration and her willingness to engage rigorously on national and international issues.

The discussion also touched on law enforcement practices, particularly Trump’s support for ""stop-and-frisk"" policing. This approach has faced scrutiny for its disproportionate impact on minority communities, and Trump’s endorsement of it stirred significant debate, revealing contrasting views on public safety and civil rights. Clinton seized the moment to criticize the implications of such policies, appealing to concerns about systemic inequalities.

Another pivotal moment in the debate emerged when Trump denied having supported the Iraq War, despite evidence suggesting otherwise, a fact pointed out by the debate moderator. This exchange highlighted the contentious nature of foreign policy discussions and Trump's struggles with his historical record. Clinton utilized this moment to emphasize her own experience and knowledge of international affairs, framing Trump’s contradictions as a lack of reliability.

In a direct challenge to Clinton's qualifications, Trump questioned her stamina to serve as president. Clinton deftly rebutted this by referencing her extensive diplomatic experience, including her tenure as Secretary of State. Her response aimed to project confidence and capability, reinforcing her position as a candidate who has navigated complex international issues effectively.

As the debate reached its conclusion, both candidates had an opportunity to present their visions for America, addressing pivotal issues that resonate with voters. While the evening began with a semblance of civility, it became clear that the pursuit of the presidency would be characterized by fierce competition and sharp contrasts in leadership styles.

In the aftermath of this defining debate, it is evident that both Clinton and Trump left no stone unturned in their attempts to sway public opinion. With the general election drawing closer, voters are left to ponder the implications of the candidates' arguments and how they will shape the future of the nation. As the race heats up, the rhetoric will undoubtedly escalate, setting the stage for an unpredictable journey to election day.",50.0,8.0,2076.0,0.6024096385542169,0.024084778420038536,894.0,0.2222222222222222,0.008948545861297539
Real_16-Webpage,Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

“I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

“It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

“Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",http://abcn.ws/2cTj7ap,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"More Michael,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting3_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting1_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting2_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_12x5_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939,"{""fb_title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""description"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@MichaelEHayden"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:03:26"", ""keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter, us news, national news, local news"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter""}","- Peaceful protesters gathered at Charlotte's city council meeting following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott.

Charlotte, NC – The air was thick with tension at a recent city council meeting as peaceful protesters gathered in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. The events of that fateful day have sparked outrage and heartfelt pleas within the community, culminating in more than 50 speakers addressing the urgent issue of police violence.

Among the speakers, a particularly poignant moment came from a young girl named Zianna Oliphant. Her emotional appeal resonated with many in attendance, shedding light on the impact of police shootings on both children and the black community as a whole. ""I have never felt such fear and sadness growing up in Charlotte,"" she stated, her voice trembling as she spoke of the collective sorrow stemming from the violence that has taken lives and disrupted families.

Zianna's heartfelt remarks echoed profound truths as she voiced her sorrow over the loss of parents due to violence. She expressed a desire for families to remain united rather than face the heart-wrenching task of burying loved ones. Zianna poignantly reminded the audience that Keith Scott was a father to seven children, emphasizing the long-lasting consequences of such tragedies on future generations.

Her impactful speech prompted a chorus of chants from protesters, who raised their voices in unison, shouting ""no justice, no peace."" This slogan has become emblematic of the community's ongoing struggles and their demand for accountability and change following Scott's death.

The tension within Charlotte has been palpable since the news broke of Scott’s fatal encounter with police. Protests erupted almost immediately, but as demonstrations unfolded, they sometimes turned violent. The situation intensified when law enforcement responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, creating confrontations and causing some protesters to engage in looting. Mayor Jennifer Roberts urged for decorum during the council meeting, yet the frustrations of the crowd were evident as they criticized her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

In a significant display of unity, following the conclusion of the meeting, a group of protesters continued to voice their demands. They called for the release of the full video depicting the circumstances surrounding Scott's shooting, seeking transparency in light of the controversial incident.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, strongly reiterated this demand in an interview, asserting the need for the community to understand the full details of the event. While Chief Putney has released portions of body and dashboard camera footage, critical questions remain. Most pressing among them is whether Scott had a firearm and what specific threat he posed to the officers involved in the encounter.

This ongoing uncertainty is fueling discontent within the community, as residents alike fight for justice and more comprehensive measures to address police violence. With anxiety palpable and painful memories resurfacing, the rallying cry for accountability and transparency only seems to grow louder.

As the city grapples with these pressing issues, the emotional impact of these events continues to resonate among its residents. The situation in Charlotte stands as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding law enforcement and the need for constructive dialogue as tensions linger. The words of young Zianna Oliphant encapsulate the call for introspection and change: a plea for justice that cannot be ignored amidst the collective grief and desire for a better future.",-57.0,-50.0,570.0,-2.28,-0.1,612.0,-2.0833333333333335,-0.08169934640522876

Real_18-Webpage,Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night’s big debate: Don’t let Donald Trump get away with it.

And Trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.”

Story Continued Below

The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.”

“The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,” Silver tweeted.

During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.

“We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told “CBS This Morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, “that that simply be checked.”

“The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.

But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump’s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he’s a Democrat and the system is “very unfair.” The “NBC Nightly News” anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.

“I don’t know that he knew what Lester Holt’s voter registration was,” said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. “He didn’t lie,” Conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.”

In a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, Monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn’t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.

But Clinton’s campaign has beat up on Holt’s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. “In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” Janet Brown, the commission’s executive director, told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

For her part, Clinton won’t let Trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn’t, either.

“There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.”

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.

“I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “You can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but I don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.”

Trump’s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp’s preparation for two Trumps.

“We don’t want Donald Trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We’re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” Mook told NBC’s “Today.”

Asked about Clinton’s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that “it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.”

But Conway shot down the notion that there’s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that “Overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and Conway joined the pile-on.

“He’s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,” Conway said. “And that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.”

After Mook warned against “a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” Conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.”

“I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.”

Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.

“I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.

“What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,” Conway said. “Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.”

Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance.

“So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself — and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.

""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""

As the nation gears up for the highly anticipated presidential debate, tensions between the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are escalating. With crucial polling data indicating a tightening race, the rhetoric around the debate is intensifying, revealing contrasting strategies and concerns from both candidates as each vies for an edge in the electoral battle.

In a proactive move, Clinton's campaign is urging media outlets and viewers alike to engage in vigilant fact-checking during the upcoming debate. They are particularly concerned about the potential for Trump to disseminate misinformation, a point that has been vocalized by Clinton's campaign manager. The emphasis on fact-checking is rooted in a desire to hold Trump accountable for his statements, especially in light of allegations that he has previously made unsubstantiated claims on various issues.

Conversely, Trump's campaign has taken a defensive stance, accusing the press of bias and alleging that Clinton's team is attempting to manipulate the debate conditions to her advantage. This accusation centers around claims that Clinton’s team is actively working to influence the moderation of the debate, a perspective shared by Trump's campaign manager. He has expressed concerns that any perceived favoritism from debate moderators could hinder Trump's ability to engage freely and effectively.

Adding to the complexities of the situation, Trump himself has made it known that he is keen to avoid any intervention from moderators reminiscent of the fact-checking by Candy Crowley during a previous debate. This indicates a desire for a more unrestrained exchange of ideas and attacks, without the interjection of fact-checking that could undermine his narrative.

In light of the ongoing discussions, the Commission on Presidential Debates has suggested a framework where moderators refrain from becoming part of the debate, thereby allowing candidates the freedom to address one another directly. This structure seeks to maintain a focus on the candidates’ dialogue rather than drawing attention to potential inaccuracies mid-discussion. However, Clinton's team is vigorously contesting this approach, insisting that Trump should not have the opportunity to repeat falsehoods without being challenged. 

The issues at play extend beyond just the candidates’ messaging. Both campaigns are also deeply concerned about how the media environment will interpret and report the unfolding drama of the debate. Clinton’s team, in particular, is apprehensive about the coverage of Trump's statements, fearing that his lies may be accepted at face value rather than scrutinized thoroughly. This concern underscores the broader implications of media influence in shaping public perception during pivotal moments in the campaign.

Meanwhile, Trump's campaign has focused its narrative on portraying Clinton in a negative light, characterizing her as robotic and overly rehearsed in her delivery. This contrasts sharply with the Trump persona, which they are promoting as spontaneous and relatable. Trump has been advised to stay true to his authentic self rather than being preoccupied with competing against Clinton on policy specifics. This strategic pivot emphasizes character and relatability over detailed policy discussions, aiming to connect with voters on a more personal level.

As the debate approaches, poll data is suggesting a ""dead heat,"" with forecasts indicating that Trump is either even with Clinton or possibly ahead in key battleground states. The increasingly competitive landscape has thrust both campaigns into high-stakes preparations, where every word spoken and strategy deployed could have lasting ramifications on the electoral outcome.

In this environment of tight polling and high tension, both candidates are honing their approaches, and each campaign is acutely aware of the stakes at play. As the nation watches and waits, the debate is shaping up to not just be a contest of ideas, but a pivotal moment in the battle for the presidency—one where fact-checking, perceptions, and the delivery of each candidate's narrative could spell the difference between victory and defeat. 

With Clinton's campaign on high alert about possible misinformation and Trump's campaign vocal about media bias and moderator impartiality, the discourse surrounding the debate is reflecting a broader narrative about truth, integrity, and the nature of political communication in the current climate. 

As Americans prepare to tune in, the anticipation builds for what promises to be a significant confrontation that could alter the very dynamics of the 2024 election cycle. The ongoing dialogue about the role of moderators, the necessity of fact-checking, and the broader implications for media treatment highlights both the challenges and responsibilities that come with such a pivotal event. In an era where information and its veracity hold immense power, the outcome of the debate could have far-reaching effects, not only impacting the candidates involved but also the political landscape in the months to follow. 

Ultimately, this debate is not merely about who presents their case better but about the deeper questions surrounding truth in politics and the media's role in shaping that narrative. As the stage is set for what may be one of the most contentious and consequential debates in recent history, it is clear that both candidates will be closely scrutinized, with their words and actions reverberating long after the final statement is made. The American electorate awaits, poised to witness a potentially historic exchange that could define the future of the nation.",-11.0,0.0,2057.0,-0.22,-0.0053475935828877,966.0,0.0,0.0
Real_19-Webpage,Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?,"I’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I’m pretty much baffled.

The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: “You’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.

Story Continued Below

Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that’s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”)

Further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).

By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump—bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post—but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump—and he's still standing.

Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history.

The Focus Is on “Moments”—But They’re Not Always The Key

Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:

“Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked Americans ‘are you better off?’ Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.”

These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It’s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “You’ve all become theater critics.”)

But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.

The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.

There Are Three Debates, Not One—And That Can Matter A Whole Lot

One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th—barely a week before the election.

Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That’s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.

Here, I think, is an opening for Clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).

Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo

The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.

“Well,” he said, “they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.”

Judo, however, can cut both ways. There’s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.

“Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.”

Debates Are NOT Decisive

One last note. It’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory.

In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.

Of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. So you’ll probably want to tune in anyway

As the political landscape heats up, the focus turns to the impending presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. With an extensive background in analyzing presidential debates—having closely scrutinized every one ever broadcast—I find myself grappling with the complexities of how Clinton should strategize against her unpredictable opponent. The stakes are incredibly high, and the nuances of their respective strengths and weaknesses are paramount in shaping the narrative of the campaign.

Donald Trump's unpredictability is a formidable challenge that Clinton must navigate carefully. His erratic nature in communication and policy positions can catch opponents off guard, and this plays into an essential aspect of debate strategy. Clinton, known for her extensive political experience, may find that these strengths could be flipped to appear as weaknesses, particularly in the context of the current political climate.

A significant concern for Clinton's campaign revolves around her qualifications and experience. While these attributes are traditionally viewed as assets, there is a potential risk that emphasizing them may invite Trump to turn the conversation into a critique of her contributions to the very issues affecting the country today. Trump has become adept at using what could be termed ""political judo,"" effectively taking an opponent’s strengths and redirecting them against them. This strategy may pose a considerable risk for Clinton if she is not careful in her delivery.

Additionally, Clinton must tackle the perceptions of trustworthiness that swirl around her candidacy when compared to Trump's own controversies. The dynamic of trust operates significantly within voter psychology, and as such, how she handles this perception in the debate could shape public opinion leading up to the election. Voter decisions are often influenced by how candidates come off in these high-stakes moments, making trustworthiness a delicate topic that could swing decisively in either direction.

Historical debate moments have played critical roles in shaping the narratives of past elections. Iconic exchanges often dominate the conversation long after the debate ends, but the cumulative effects of exchanges over multiple debates can also be decisive. With the upcoming debate being the first of three scheduled encounters, Clinton similarly has an opportunity to recover from any potential missteps in subsequent debates. An initial stumble could provide fodder for Trump’s aggressive messaging, but a strong performance could significantly bolster her campaign.

The town hall format of the debate could serve as a unique opportunity for Clinton. In this setting, her ability to connect personal concerns with her proposed policies could resonate with voters. Engaging with citizens directly, rather than just delivering speeches from a podium, often allows for more genuine and relatable communication, potentially humanizing her and demonstrating her commitment to addressing voter issues.

However, it's crucial to recognize that the effectiveness of debates in determining electoral outcomes is often overstated. Scholars and political analysts alike stress that while debates can influence voter perceptions and provide defining moments, they do not singularly determine election outcomes. Studies over the years have consistently suggested that more fundamental issues—such as economic performance, voter polarization, and sociopolitical dynamics—play a more significant role in shaping election results than debates do.

As the date approaches for Clinton and Trump to step onto the debate stage, both candidates will undoubtedly leverage “political judo.” Each will seek to undermine the other's strengths, calling attention to vulnerabilities while navigating the intricate landscape of public opinion and media scrutiny. The skillful execution of strategies during these three encounters will likely define the trajectory of the campaign, but a reminder of the historical context must be kept in mind.

When analyzing results from prior elections, the crucial aspects of candidate profiles—how they resonate with various demographics, the handling of hot-button issues, and their overall narratives—constitute the bedrock of electoral outcomes. Debates, while entertaining and occasionally pivotal, form just one element in the larger puzzle of electoral politics.

In conclusion, as we look toward this pivotal moment in the election cycle, it will be fascinating to see how Hillary Clinton approaches the challenges set forth by Donald Trump.

Real_2-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have',"Story highlights ""This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" Clinton said

The deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage in the election

Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.

""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.""

The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.

Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton.

“The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?”

“I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.”

Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race.

“He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”

In the midst of an intense presidential campaign, Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, expressed a strong sense of pride in offering voters an alternative to the major party candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. He took a firm stance against both candidates, labeling them as ""deeply flawed"" and emphasizing the growing need for a third option in American politics.

Addressing concerns about potentially acting as a ""spoiler"" for Clinton, Johnson dismissed such claims, arguing that his supporters are committed to voting for him because they believe in his vision rather than settling for the lesser evil presented by the two prominent candidates. “We’re seeing a shift,” Johnson commented, highlighting that approximately 50% of new voters are registering as independents. This statistic raises questions about the traditional binary choice in the election, further underscoring the demand for alternative political parties.

Voting, according to Johnson, should be about selecting a first choice rather than compromise. He is urging Americans to consider the implications of their votes and to prioritize their true preferences in the electoral process.

However, Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, attempted to downplay Johnson’s potential influence in the race, noting a decline in his poll numbers. Citing a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, Mook revealed that Johnson’s support had dropped to 5 percent. This statistic reflects the fluctuating dynamics of public opinion as the election approaches, yet Johnson remains determined to challenge the political status quo and advocate for a choice beyond the major parties.",4.0,4.0,300.0,0.5,0.013333333333333334,303.0,0.4,0.013201320132013201

Real_22-Webpage,Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.”

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.”

Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

The United States Senate reconvened this week with Democrats introducing significant legislation aimed at increasing transparency among presidential candidates regarding their tax returns. Spearheaded by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the proposed bill mandates that all presidential candidates must disclose their tax returns within 15 days following their party's nomination. This legislation emphasizes the importance of financial transparency in elections, allowing voters to have access to crucial information that could influence their voting decisions.

Under the new bill, if a candidate fails to comply with the requirement to release their tax returns, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would take action by releasing the necessary documents after a 30-day period. This regulatory measure aims to ensure that voters are not left in the dark about the financial dealings of those who seek the highest office in the nation.

Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a supporter of the bill, expressed optimism regarding the legislation's chances for a vote next week. He believes there is no valid reason to delay action on such a critical issue. “We must ensure that transparency is a cornerstone of our electoral process,” Murphy stated, underlining the urgency of the matter.

The tradition of disclosing tax returns is not new, and the Clinton family has set a strong precedent by making their financial information publicly available for over 30 years. Historically, the practice has been observed by numerous candidates, with the notable exception of Gerald Ford, who remains the only candidate to have refused to disclose his tax information. In the context of recent elections, the practice of transparency has garnered considerable attention; during the 2012 election, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid vocally criticized Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns. This scrutiny ultimately led to revelations about substantial income alongside a lack of tax payment.

Reid's criticisms did not stop there; he has consistently targeted former President Donald Trump, dubbing him ""ethically compromised"" and referring to him as the ""king of the welfare kings."" This concern for transparency in financial dealings has raised questions about the integrity of candidates and their fitness for office.

The conversation surrounding financial disclosure is anchored in the belief that American voters deserve to have access to essential information about candidates such as Trump. The legislation aims to reinforce this fundamental democratic principle, ensuring that voters are equipped with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions at the polls.

In the context of heightened scrutiny surrounding Trump's financial matters, there have been mounting calls for Congress to take decisive action against him, including demands for impeachment. As such discussions unfold, the Senate's move towards legislation requiring candidates to disclose their tax returns adds a pressing layer to the ongoing debate about transparency, accountability, and the ethics of those who wish to lead the nation. The outcome of this initiative could resound through future elections, shaping voters' expectations of financial disclosure and ethical standards for candidates.",-9.0,11.0,496.0,-0.6428571428571429,-0.018145161290322582,559.0,0.5789473684210527,0.01967799642218247
Real_23-Webpage,Dem congressman to IRS: Audit the Trump Foundation,"Story highlights Trump reportedly used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes,"" Sander Levin wrote to the IRS

Washington (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen

The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.

The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.

This request emerges in light of a report revealing that former President Donald Trump utilized $258,000 from the charity for personal legal settlements, raising questions about the foundation's compliance with charitable guidelines.

Levin emphasized the importance of adhering to the true purpose of charitable donations, asserting that funds earmarked for charity must support philanthropic efforts rather than serve personal financial interests.

Real_24-Webpage,Armed Intruders Break in House…Armed Resident Responds – Eagle Rising,"Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun.

The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway.

After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away.

In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.”

Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.”

Atlanta, GA – In a shocking early morning incident, three armed men broke into an Atlanta resident's home around 4:00 AM, leading to a dramatic confrontation that ended with one intruder dead and two others on the run. 

The homeowner was not alone during the invasion; a co-worker was present for work-related reasons and quickly responded by drawing a handgun. Surveillance cameras captured the tense encounter, showing the co-worker firing at the intruders, which prompted them to flee the scene. One intruder reportedly jumped through a glass door in the chaotic escape.

Tragically, one of the intruders succumbed to gunshot wounds in the driveway of the residence, while the other two escaped and remain at large.

Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.

“They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.”

Story Continued Below

Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.

“I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.”

“Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.”

Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.

""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.

“I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""

While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.

“I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”

Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.""

“I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, former President Donald Trump has publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the performance of debate moderator Lester Holt, labeling his questioning as biased. Trump contended that Holt failed to adequately cover significant issues related to Hillary Clinton, primarily focusing instead on his own controversies.

During a press conference following the debate, Trump vented his frustrations over what he perceived to be an unfair questioning strategy employed by Holt. He asserted that while he was subjected to probing inquiries about his tax returns and past lawsuits, Holt neglected to bring up any of the scandals linked to Clinton, a discrepancy Trump found particularly troubling. ""Why wasn't she asked about her emails or the Benghazi incident?"" he questioned, illustrating his argument that the moderator's focus was skewed.

Trump went on to assign Holt a grade of C+ for his moderation, indicating that while he appreciated some of the initial, issue-based questions, the flow of questioning soon deviated toward personal attacks. The debate featured notable moments where Holt questioned Trump about a 40-year-old housing discrimination lawsuit and the so-called ""birther"" claims surrounding the legitimacy of President Barack Obama's birthplace. Trump characterized these lines of inquiry as outdated and irrelevant to the pressing issues facing American voters today.

Highlighting the disparities in questioning, Trump called attention to Holt's omissions when it came to pressing Clinton about her emails and the controversies surrounding the Clinton Foundation, stating that it was a missed opportunity to hold her accountable. Trump alleged that Holt's failure to scrutinize Clinton's record contributed to a one-sided debate atmosphere, where his own history was dissected while pertinent issues facing Clinton remained unaddressed.

The criticisms of Holt's moderation were echoed by other prominent figures in the Republican Party. GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence, taking the stage following the debate, joined Trump in denouncing Holt's performance. Pence lamented that the moderator's inquiries largely overlooked significant questions pertinent to Clinton's candidacy, which, in his view, diluted the responsibility of holding both candidates to the same standard during the debate.

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, also threw her support behind calls for more rigorous inquiries into issues such as Benghazi and the controversial handling of Clinton’s emails. Conway emphasized that true fairness in a debate must involve a balanced examination of both candidates' records, suggesting that Holt fell short of achieving this balance.

Adding to his list of grievances, Trump mentioned an unfortunate technical issue he experienced during the debate—a malfunctioning microphone. He pondered whether this was a deliberate tactic, hinting at the possibility that the debates were not being conducted on a completely level playing field. The sound issues, according to Trump, hampered his ability to effectively communicate his points, thus potentially affecting the overall perception of his performance.

As the debate unfolded, Trump also faced personal jabs aimed at his character, particularly centered around Clinton’s remarks regarding Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe. Clinton utilized Machado as a seemingly strategic example to question Trump's past comments and treatment of women, which appeared to unsettle Trump towards the concluding moments of the debate. 

Trump defended his past comments regarding Machado, characterizing her as a difficult contestant during her time in the Miss Universe pageant. He dismissed her relevance to the contemporary political landscape and expressed annoyance that she was brought up at all, suggesting it was a last-minute attempt by Clinton to draw attention away from her own shortcomings. 

The fallout from the debate indicates that the dialogue surrounding the candidates will continue to focus on which issues were prioritized and how voters perceive their candidates based on the discourse presented in such critical forums. Trump’s critiques of Holt, coupled with the echoes of his campaign staff and fellow Republicans, delve into ongoing discussions about fairness, scrutiny, and the role of moderators in political debates.

As the election approaches, the conversations surrounding the transparency and accountability of candidates will likely intensify. Clearly, Trump's dissatisfaction with the debate format and the questioning technique used by Holt reflects a broader concern among Republican candidates regarding how issues are framed in public discourse. 

Moving forward, both campaigns will need to navigate the provocative remarks and the perceived inequities that emerged during the debate. With the landscape of American political exchanges continuing to evolve, how each candidate addresses these challenges could significantly impact voter perceptions leading up to the election. 

As debates and discussions continue, it remains crucial for each candidate to not only respond to challenges posed by their opponents and moderators but also to convey clear and honest communication regarding their policies and records. The dynamic at play in the current political landscape demonstrates the importance of debate formats and moderator responsibility as critical elements in shaping public opinion and influencing electoral outcomes. 

In summary, Trump's criticisms of Lester Holt and the perceived bias in his questioning highlight an ongoing tension between the candidates and the media in the realm of politics. Both sides will strive to adapt and refine their approaches as they engage in this intense electoral battle, seeking to maintain the favor of the electorate while navigating the complexities of a contentious political arena.",-41.0,-9.0,1119.0,-1.025,-0.03663985701519214,973.0,-0.2727272727272727,-0.009249743062692703
Real_26-Webpage,One Critically Wounded As Charlotte Police Endure Second Night Of RIOTS… [VIDEO],"One Critically Wounded As Charlotte Police Endure Second Night Of RIOTS… [VIDEO]

In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.

Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.

From the Daily Mail:

National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.

A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.

On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street.

After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.

A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has been rocked by a second night of violent protests following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. The unrest erupted as citizens expressed their outrage over the incident, leading to escalating tensions between demonstrators and law enforcement. 

In response to the growing violence, the Governor of North Carolina declared a state of emergency. The declaration aims to restore peace and safeguard both the citizens and the resources of the area. The situation escalated significantly after a protester was critically injured, suffering a gunshot wound to the head. Reports indicate that this individual is currently on life support, adding a somber note to the already fraught atmosphere. Additionally, at least three other protesters and four police officers sustained injuries during the tumultuous confrontations.

To assist local law enforcement in managing the chaotic situation, the National Guard has been deployed to the city. Their presence comes as law enforcement struggles to contain the volatile protests that have erupted in various parts of Charlotte. The deployment underscores the seriousness of the situation, with authorities taking measures to restore order amid the unrest.

As the nights of protesting continued, troubling reports surfaced of protesters attacking media personnel. Journalists covering the events found themselves in the line of fire, raising concerns about the broader implications for freedom of the press during civil unrest. Such actions have drawn condemnation from various quarters, underscoring the challenges faced by media in reporting on sensitive and volatile situations.

The violence has not only impacted individuals but has also left its mark on the local economy. Several businesses, including the prominent NASCAR Hall of Fame, have been vandalized amid the chaos. The damage to property has led many major companies in the area to advise their employees to avoid the downtown region until the situation is resolved. This precautionary measure highlights the unsettling atmosphere in a city that has become a focal point of national attention over these last few days.

In a bid to restore order, Charlotte's mayor has been contemplating the implementation of a curfew. Such a measure could help to curtail the violence and encourage citizens to return home, though it remains unclear how protesters will react to additional restrictions on their ability to gather and express their grievances. 

The protests featured a curious mixture of sentiments among the demonstrators. While many voiced support for the actions against police brutality, there was also opposition directed towards fellow protesters who engaged in violent behavior. This infighting illustrates a complex landscape of public sentiment, where the desire for justice can often clash with methods deemed too aggressive or destructive.

Cleanup efforts are already underway as workers strive to address the damage inflicted on the city. Broken windows and graffiti are just a few of the remnants of the protests that have marred the public spaces in Charlotte. Apart from the physical cleanup, there is an underlying need to heal the community, which has been deeply affected by both the shooting of Scott and the subsequent protests.

Direct confrontations between police and protesters have become commonplace, leading to law enforcement employing riot control measures in a bid to manage the situation. The tension between the two sides has escalated, with police striving to maintain order amid a backdrop of palpable anger and frustration from the demonstrators.

As Charlotte continues to grapple with the fallout from the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, the city remains a focal point for discussions surrounding police conduct and the handling of protests. While officials and community leaders work towards finding a resolution, the impact of these events is likely to resonate throughout the city and beyond for some time to come. 

In light of the ongoing unrest, one thing is clear: Charlotte is facing a pivotal moment as it confronts issues of race, justice, and community relations. As the situation evolves, the eyes of the nation will remain on North Carolina, waiting to see how the city responds to this urgent call for change.",-82.0,-62.0,674.0,-2.484848484848485,-0.12166172106824925,741.0,-2.0,-0.08367071524966262

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked Rouhani whether he'd rather work with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. Rouhani said, ""Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.

Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.

In a recent interview with MSNBC's Chuck Todd, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani expressed confidence in the resilience of the nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite the ongoing U.S. election season. Rouhani outlined the critical differences between the candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, regarding their views on the agreement.

Rouhani underscored the legitimacy of the JCPOA, noting that it is an international agreement solidified by a United Nations Security Council resolution. His remarks come as Trump has been vocal in his criticism of the deal, labeling it a ""bad deal"" and signaling ambitions to dismantle it if elected. In contrast, Rouhani pointed out that Clinton endorses the deal but approaches it with caution, encapsulating her stance as ""distrust and verify.""

Further reflecting on the political landscape, Rouhani asserted that discussions surrounding the nuclear agreement during election cycles are frequently influenced by political motivations rather than a genuine desire for change. This sentiment highlights the complexities and ramifications of U.S. foreign policy as it relates to Iran and the broader international community.

As the election season progresses, Rouhani's comments serve as a reminder of the critical nature of the JCPOA and the divergent paths the U.S. may take depending on the outcome of the presidential race.",9.0,7.0,257.0,0.9,0.03501945525291829,255.0,0.875,0.027450980392156862
Real_28-Webpage,“How Can we LEAD When we Can’t Even Control Our Own Cities?” [VIDEO] – Eagle Rising,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said:

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.

“Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.

“Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?

“We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.

“Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.

“The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.

“There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.

“Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.”

Former President Donald Trump delivered a strong message of unity during a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he addressed the recent national unrest fueled by officer-involved shootings. Speaking to a crowd of supporters, Trump highlighted the importance of coming together as a nation to overcome challenges and strive for greatness.

In his address, Trump emphasized the need for Americans to respect the flag and engage with differing perspectives, arguing that understanding across divides is essential for moving forward. He specifically pointed to the visible unrest in cities such as Charlotte, voicing his concern about the damaging impact this turmoil could have on America’s global image.

While acknowledging the citizens' right to peaceful protest, Trump clearly condemned any violent disruptions that jeopardize public safety. In his remarks, he reiterated that every American deserves to live in safe communities, emphasizing the urgency to eradicate violence that threatens citizens as well as law enforcement officers.

Trump's speech took a pointed turn as he expressed particular concern for law-abiding African-American residents, noting that they are often disproportionately affected by riots and unrest. He underscored the government's responsibility to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these communities, highlighting the need for law enforcement to protect and serve without fear of violent backlash.

“Compassion should never be extended to lawless conduct,” Trump stated emphatically, underscoring his administration's stance on crime and violence. He made it clear that under his leadership, America would not tolerate such disturbances, reiterating that the safety of peaceful families must be prioritized over the interests of those engaging in violent disruptions.

This message of prioritizing community safety resonated strongly, reflecting a consistent theme in Trump's rhetoric surrounding law and order. With the nation grappling with unrest and calls for reform, his remarks aim to position him as a proponent of peace and stability amidst chaos.

The Pittsburgh speech represents not only a call for unity but also a reaffirmation of Trump's commitment to a strong law enforcement policy. As he continues to engage with the public, his emphasis on the need to bridge divides while addressing the challenges faced by communities is likely to remain a focal point of his message. 

As the country navigates through heightened tensions related to social justice, policing, and public safety, Trump’s address seeks to unify Americans around a common goal — the vision of a safe, prosperous, and cohesive nation. By placing the spotlight on the need for mutual respect, understanding, and the upholding of law and order, Trump continues to advocate for an America where public safety is paramount.

With cities across the nation facing unrest, Trump's call for unity and respect serves as both a reminder and a challenge to Americans. In a time when the nation faces complex issues, the task ahead emphasizes the need for communities to work together to create a safer environment for all. 

The former president’s address in Pittsburgh crystallizes his stance as he seeks to influence the national conversation regarding safety, respect, and the vital importance of peaceful coexistence in America.",-5.0,17.0,540.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.009259259259259259,582.0,0.8947368421052632,0.029209621993127148
Real_29-Webpage,9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him,"""Donald, you’re a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him

Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.

That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father.

Story Continued Below

1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection

In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.”

“The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’”

2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward”

Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.”

“It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said.

3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully”

“Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said . “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.”

4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women”

Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.”

5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky”

In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.”

6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth”

Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.”

7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said

“I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said .

8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer”

Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’

And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.”

9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family

“I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.

Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.

In political circles, endorsements hold significant weight, often signaling a unified front within a party, particularly when elections loom. Yet, the journey to Ted Cruz's recent endorsement of Donald Trump has been anything but straightforward, marked by public feuds and biting critiques that raise questions about political loyalty and personal values.

Cruz's endorsement comes two months following fierce backlash for his previous reluctance to support Trump at the Republican National Convention. At that time, many attributed Cruz's hesitation to a personal vendetta sparked by a series of sharp attacks from Trump, particularly those targeting Cruz's family. However, as the political landscape evolves, Cruz has seemingly shifted gears, opting to back Trump despite their contentious history.

The road to Cruz's endorsement includes a series of dramatic confrontations that have played out in the public eye. Notably, over recent months, Trump has unleashed a barrage of insults toward Cruz, to which the senator has responded with equal fervor. In a striking departure from typical political decorum, Cruz previously labeled Trump a ""sniveling coward,"" a statement prompted by Trump's derogatory comments regarding his wife, Heidi. Cruz emphasized that personal attacks on family members cross a line that should never be broached in political discourse.

In his critiques, Cruz does not shy away from labeling Trump as a ""big, loud New York bully."" He has also described him as ""a small and petty man"" who exhibits an apparent fear of women who display strength. Such characterizations point toward a deeper disdain for Trump's demeanor and leadership style, which Cruz seems to believe undermines the values of the Republican Party.

Cruz's skepticism did not stop with personal insults; he further speculated on the potential implications of Trump's tax returns. Citing a belief that such financial documents could unveil troubling connections to organized crime, Cruz questioned the former president's reluctance to disclose this information. This line of inquiry, significant in its implications, underscores the prevailing narrative of mistrust and uncertainty that has characterized Cruz's public stance on Trump.

The fury reached a crescendo when Cruz dismissed a conspiracy theory implicating his father in President John F. Kennedy's assassination, referring to it as ""nuts"" and ""kooky."" This was not merely a defense of Cruz's familial honor but also an indication of the lengths to which Trump has gone to stoke division within the party. Cruz's rebuttal encapsulated both his frustration and his determination to protect his family's reputation amidst a backdrop of political turmoil.

Concerns regarding truthfulness loom large in Cruz's assessments of Trump. His assertion that Trump is a ""pathological liar"" who fails to discern truth from falsehood resonates with many who have scrutinized the former president's numerous public statements. Cruz's denunciation is pointed: he contends that Trump lies with alarming regularity, further complicating the narrative surrounding the efficacy and honesty of the Trump administration. He even claimed that Trump has mastered the art of deception to the point where he could pass a lie detector test while making conflicting statements.

Beyond labeling Trump a liar, Cruz's critiques delve into the intricacies of character. He has portrayed Trump as ""utterly amoral,"" a description that speaks volumes about his view of Trump’s ethics and values. Further character flaws attributed to Trump include a narcissistic streak and a reputation as ""a serial philanderer."" Such critiques are not incidental; they reflect Cruz's broader concerns about the integrity and moral compass of a man he now seeks to endorse.

Despite this endorsement, Cruz maintains that his allegiance to family values and personal loyalty remains unwavering. He has firmly reiterated his discomfort with supporting anyone who publicly attacks his family, which casts a shadow over the sincerity of his endorsement. The juxtaposition of his family loyalty against his political behavior paints a complex picture of a man torn between personal principles and the demands of party allegiance.

The landscape surrounding Cruz’s endorsement is emblematic of the wider divides within the Republican Party. As members grapple with their allegiances and ideologies, Cruz's approach serves as a fascinating case study in the balancing act of maintaining personal integrity while navigating a turbulent political sphere. The senator's ability to reconcile his past criticisms of Trump with his immediate political commitments may influence other Republican leaders facing similar dilemmas.

As the political situation unfolds leading to upcoming elections, Cruz's endorsement could have significant ramifications. It begs important questions about the nature of party loyalty—is it a fluid construct that can be molded to accommodate political expediency, or does it adhere to deeper values that some members, like Cruz, seem eager to uphold? The answer may ultimately define the future trajectory of the Republican Party as it continues to grapple with its identity and direction.

Cruz's pivot toward endorsing Trump, despite the verbal and personal assaults exchanged in their prior engagements, speaks to the complicated nature of contemporary politics, where personal grievances can be set aside in an effort to unify for a common goal. Whether or not this endorsement will resonate with the party's base remains to be seen—and for Ted Cruz, the hope is that in endorsing Trump, he can reclaim some semblance of coherence given the chaos that has marked his recent political journey. 

In the backdrop of this political endorsement, the conversations surrounding family values, personal integrity, and party loyalty are far from over. As Cruz aligns himself with Trump, many observers are left to ponder if the price of political alignment is too steep when weighed against personal convictions. The unfolding narrative promises to be riveting in the months ahead as political tensions flare and alliances are tested.",-40.0,6.0,974.0,-1.2903225806451613,-0.04106776180698152,1076.0,0.15,0.0055762081784386614

These counties could play an outsize role in the election and offer an instructive example of what the political parties have accomplished. Wake County is the fourth county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties.

Washington (CNN)

Few counties could prove more decisive in this election than Wake County, North Carolina.

A historically competitive county whose fortunes are on the rise, Wake could help deliver Hillary Clinton a win in a key battleground state -- or dash her hopes for the presidency. Simply put, if Clinton performs well in the highly educated research triangle, then election night bodes well for her. If Wake County doesn't come out for Clinton, Donald Trump's path to the White House would grow much clearer.

The county is rapidly expanding, and the influx of new people and industries could reshape the race. Meanwhile, the turmoil across the state in Charlotte after a police officer shot and killed a black man could add another focal point in the election — search data from Google Trends shows Wake County's spiking interest in ""police brutality"" this week.

Keep your eye on Wake County, and take a look at the fundamentals below.

Population

Wake County is fairly representative of the country in terms of race and ethnicity, but it has a more highly educated population, bigger incomes and a better job picture than the rest of the nation.

In the latest installment of CNN's series ""Critical Counties,"" hosted by chief national correspondent John King, attention shifts to Wake County, North Carolina—an area poised to play a decisive role in the 2016 election. As the fourth county featured in the series, Wake County’s political leanings could notably impact Hillary Clinton’s success in this battleground state.

With its rapidly growing population, Wake County is becoming an increasingly influential electoral force. As new residents and industries settle in, they may shift the dynamics of the upcoming vote. Strong support for Clinton within Wake County could signal a successful election night for her campaign, while a lack of enthusiasm may open the door for Donald Trump to capitalize on the county’s electoral votes.

Recent local events have added another layer of complexity to the electoral landscape. Turmoil stemming from police-related incidents has led to heightened public interest in issues surrounding police brutality, as indicated by Google Trends. This increasing awareness of social issues could influence voter sentiment, potentially swaying undecided voters or those disillusioned by current affairs.

Wake County's diverse demographics—marked by a blend of racial and ethnic representations, higher education levels, and greater incomes—contrast favorably with national averages. Coupled with a robust job market, these factors suggest that the county's voters are well-informed and engaged, making their preferences crucial in determining the final election outcome.

As the election draws closer, all eyes will be on Wake County to see how its evolving landscape influences the choices of its residents amidst a charged political atmosphere.",14.0,11.0,293.0,1.0769230769230769,0.04778156996587031,307.0,1.0,0.035830618892508145

President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

“What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.”

“That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.

The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.

“Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”

In a break from tradition, President Barack Obama donned headgear during the White House Tribal Nations Conference, raising eyebrows among political observers. During the event, which spotlighted the importance of tribal leadership and culture, Obama was honored with a hat and a blanket presented by Native American leaders as he took the stage to deliver his remarks.

While he embraced the spirit of the occasion by wearing the blanket over his shoulders, Obama opted to remove the hat shortly after, reinforcing the informal nature of the event. Obama expressed heartfelt gratitude for the honor, calling the gestures “amazing” and “kind,” highlighting the respect and appreciation he holds for Native American cultures.

In a light-hearted moment, Obama joked about the practicality of the blanket, referencing his wife, Michelle Obama. He quipped that he might need a blanket specifically for her, suggesting she might take his once they returned home.

The incident has reignited discussions around an informal rule in presidential decorum that advises against wearing headgear. This tradition is often linked to former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, whose infamous helmet-wearing during a campaign event became a point of contention and ridicule.

Interestingly, Obama himself acknowledged this unwritten rule during a 2013 event, remarking that presidents should avoid items on their heads. However, in the context of the Tribal Nations Conference, it appears that the occasion warranted an exception, blending respect for Native culture with a sense of humor.

As Obama’s presidency continues, this moment stands out as a unique intersection of cultural respect and political tradition, showcasing a leader both aware of history yet willing to engage with it on his own terms.",17.0,27.0,327.0,1.4166666666666667,0.05198776758409786,322.0,2.4545454545454546,0.08385093167701864

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.

“Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.”

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.”

“We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.

Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”

But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.

“I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.

As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

In a passionate appeal to voters, Hillary Clinton highlighted the critical importance of the upcoming election during her appearance on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show.” She emphasized that the choices made in November would have a profound impact on America for the next half-century, urging voters, particularly within the black community, to actively participate in the electoral process.

Clinton's message was clear: this election involves all the key issues that matter to the electorate. With just 50 days remaining until the polls open, she underscored the urgency for voters to remain engaged and informed about their registration statuses. “Your voice matters, and your vote is your power,” she insisted, reinforcing her commitment to encouraging voter turnout at this pivotal moment. 

This call to action coincided with remarks from former President Barack Obama, who addressed the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, urging citizens to recognize the societal progress that hangs in the balance this election cycle. Both leaders emphasized the necessity for voter mobilization, particularly among black voters, who have historically played a significant role in determining election outcomes.

As the first presidential debate between Clinton and her Republican opponent Donald Trump looms on the horizon, scheduled for Monday in New York, the stakes continue to rise. Clinton articulated her determination to confront Trump’s aggressive tactics head-on, vowing to communicate fearlessly and directly during the debates. She indicated that she would not shy away from addressing the divisive rhetoric that has characterized Trump's campaign, particularly his derogatory comments about marginalized groups—including African-Americans, immigrants, Muslims, women, and individuals with disabilities.

The discourse surrounding the electoral battle is charged with heightened tension, as Trump recently took to Twitter to mock Clinton, implying that she was taking the day off before the debate. This public exchange mirrors the broader contentious tone of the campaign, as both candidates seek to galvanize their supporters and sway undecided voters in the critical final stretch.

Clinton's comprehensive focus on the upcoming election underscores a pivotal moment in American history—one in which voters can either solidify or challenge the progress made on various social issues. The former Secretary of State’s insistence on checking voter registration status is a reminder of the logistical aspects of participation that can often be overlooked amidst the fervor of political campaigns.

As the election day approaches, Clinton’s message resonates with urgency, emphasizing that the future trajectory of the nation is at stake. Her commitment to addressing the needs and concerns of the electorate, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented communities, exemplifies the high stakes of this election.

The upcoming debates will serve as a crucial battleground for both candidates as they present their visions for the future of America. With much at stake on the ballot, the call for active participation resonates louder than ever as voters prepare to make their voices heard.",7.0,8.0,524.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013358778625954198,541.0,0.47058823529411764,0.014787430683918669

This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.

Story Continued Below

So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.

Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.

Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as “another Hitler.” She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.

In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.

That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.

It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin’s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did—an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing Russians,” a doubly illegal act of war.

Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.

***

John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, “Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.” Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.

But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.” Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.”

Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.

“Our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.”

He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. “All this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.”

John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.

The legacy of JFK & RFK is “being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party.”

Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.

Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.

Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.

Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime “existential” threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be “existential” enemy.

There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.

Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.”

Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.

But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.

For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.

And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.

***

So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.

We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.

President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future.

Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.

But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.

Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.

Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “There can be no business as usual with Russia.”

Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.

And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:

Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.

Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.

Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.

This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.

Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.

Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.

Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

In a striking political development, Adam Walinsky, a longtime Democrat known for his significant contributions to the Kennedy administration and Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign, has publicly announced his intention to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. This move has stunned many in the political arena, especially given Walinsky’s deep roots in Democratic politics and the legacy he passionately upholds.

Walinsky has taken to task the current Democratic Party for what he describes as its transformation into the ""Party of War."" As he critiques the contemporary Democratic stance, he highlights a troubling trend of supporting military interventions and becoming inadvertently aligned with arms merchants. This is a marked deviation from the peace-oriented legacy that both John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy epitomized—a profound concern for national and international peace that he feels has been overshadowed by aggressive military posturing.

As the campaign heats up, Walinsky’s criticism extends to Hillary Clinton, whom he believes embodies a continuation of the aggressive foreign policies that have characterized recent Democratic administrations. He points to her advocacy for military actions against nations like Russia and Syria, viewing it as a dangerous trajectory that threatens to escalate global tensions. According to Walinsky, this pattern not only undermines the peace that the Kennedys fought for but also poses a risk to U.S. national security.

In stark contrast, Walinsky lauds Trump for his willingness to engage in dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting that this dialogue-driven approach is far more effective than the prevailing militaristic stance of current policymakers. He argues that true diplomacy is essential in today’s geopolitical climate, asserting that it is crucial for the United States to step back from aggressive postures and focus on fostering understanding and cooperation with other nations, particularly those that have been considered adversaries.

While it is well-recognized that Trump has several political flaws, Walinsky defends him on the grounds of political courage. He praises Trump for his audacity to challenge the entrenched military establishment in Washington and to question the conventional wisdom that has long dictated U.S. foreign policy. Such a departure from the status quo, he argues, is a necessary step in moving toward a more peaceful and rational international relationship model.

Drawing parallels to John F. Kennedy’s efforts during the Cold War, Walinsky passionately argues for a renewed focus on diplomacy and the rejection of what he perceives as unnecessary wars—a notion that resonates deeply in the current socio-political landscape marked by conflict and division. He envisions a United States that prioritizes diplomatic solutions over military interventions, much like the spirit that guided the Kennedys during their time in office.

Beyond foreign policy, Walinsky emphasizes a critical shift in focus for America. He calls for a reallocation of attention toward domestic issues, advocating for a renewed commitment to community safety rather than continued military engagement abroad. This call to action speaks to the necessity of nurturing the foundational aspects of American society—strengthening local communities, enhancing public welfare, and ensuring safety for all citizens at home.

Moreover, Walinsky warns of the potentially dire consequences that could arise from a new Cold War and a subsequent nuclear arms race. He argues that cooperative relations with nations like Russia and China are imperative not only for maintaining global peace but also for collaboratively addressing issues like terrorism. He believes that a united front against shared threats is more effective than the isolationist or confrontational approaches that have recently gained traction in American politics.

At the core of Walinsky's reasoning is the belief that Trump's platform aligns closely with traditional American values. He argues that Trump’s ""America first"" philosophy resonates with a historical precedent prioritizing national interests while cultivating peace. In an era where many feel disillusioned with the political establishment, Walinsky’s endorsement serves as a reminder that the quest for peace and stability can take many forms, including the choices made at the ballot box.

Ultimately, Walinsky concludes that despite any imperfections attributed to Trump, the push for an ""America first"" approach represents a necessary departure from the status quo. His endorsement is rooted not just in a critique of the Democratic Party’s current trajectory but also in a hopeful vision for a more peaceful future—one that could emerge if America realigns its foreign policies with a commitment to diplomacy, safety, and cooperation.

As the presidential election draws closer, Walinsky's unexpected endorsement may resonate with those who, like him, yearn for a shift in both party allegiance and the broader discourse on foreign policy. His stance serves as a crucial reminder of the complexities of political identities and the idea that the pursuit of peace transcends party lines. As a long-time advocate for diplomacy and constructively critical of the military-industrial complex, Walinsky’s voice adds a significant dimension to the ongoing national conversation about America’s role in the world and how it addresses the pressing challenges ahead.",-120.0,35.0,3840.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.03125,918.0,1.206896551724138,0.03812636165577342

As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.

Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.

From the Independent Review Journal:

But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:

People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474655224000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer4.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer1.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer2.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer3.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer5.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters."", ""title"": ""NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte - But It Wasn't To Protest The National Anthem... | John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 750, ""identifier"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg"", ""height"": 563}, ""url"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""always"", ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 1631890973779575, ""pages"": 389658314427637}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Black Lives Matter"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-23T14:27:04-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/terresamonroe""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- NC State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters, contrasting with other instances of kneeling in protest against police actions.

CHARLOTTE, NC – In a poignant display of faith amidst unrest, North Carolina State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters. This heartwarming moment starkly contrasts with the more common images that have emerged over recent years of kneeling in protest against police actions. The photo of the troopers praying quickly went viral after the North Carolina Troopers Association shared it, offering a powerful visual of their commitment to community and spirituality.

The context for this gathering was undeniably tense. The prayer took place in the wake of an officer-involved shooting that resulted in the tragic death of Keith Lamont Scott, an event that ignited significant unrest in the city. As protests erupted, the scenes in Charlotte reflected a community yearning for peace and understanding amidst the chaos.

In an inspiring turn of events, many community members stepped forward during the protests, offering their own prayers for calm and encouraging peaceful interactions between demonstrators and law enforcement. This wave of grassroots intervention showcased a shared desire for unity, demonstrating that faith can be a powerful force for reconciliation, even in the most challenging circumstances.

The article also draws attention to similar scenes of prayer occurring not only in Charlotte but also in Memphis and various cities across the nation. These instances highlight the enduring truth that faith transcends racial lines, uniting individuals from diverse backgrounds in a collective hope for peace and understanding.

The author notes the positive role of the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team, which was present during the unrest in Charlotte. Their mission of providing spiritual support in times of crisis resonated with many, as they actively contributed to the message of healing and unity permeating the demonstrations.

While the piece expresses support for the police, it also conveys a firm critique of groups regarded as inciting violence, specifically identifying Black Lives Matter as detrimental to the cause of peace. The stark juxtaposition between those advocating for violence and those seeking reconciliation underscores the tensions that persist within the community.

The overarching message throughout these events promotes a strong commitment to unity through faith, urging individuals to reject hate and division in society. In an age often characterized by polarization, the imagery of troopers kneeling in prayer serves as a reminder of the fundamental values that can bring people together, regardless of their differences.

As the nation grapples with issues surrounding race and policing, the actions of both the North Carolina State Troopers and the community surrounding them serve as beacons of hope. They exemplify how moments of genuine faith and mutual respect can bridge divides and foster understanding in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, the events in Charlotte portray a powerful narrative of seeking community, healing, and unity through faith. They remind us that even amidst tension and unrest, compassion and mutual support can prevail. The call for peace through prayer is a touching appeal to humanity that resonates deeply, echoing a shared longing for a world less defined by division and more by connection and understanding.",3.0,34.0,580.0,0.1,0.005172413793103448,566.0,1.619047619047619,0.06007067137809187

Real_35-Webpage,Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games.

Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.

Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.

""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.

While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.

During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!""

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe may be on the brink of disciplinary action after kneeling during the national anthem at a recent match. Rapinoe, known for her outspoken activism, continued her protest on September 18 during a game against the Netherlands, despite U.S. Soccer's official expectation that players and coaches stand in respect during the anthem.

Rapinoe's actions are rooted in solidarity with former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who became a symbol of resistance against police brutality and racial prejudice when he first knelt during the national anthem in 2016. Her standoff with U.S. Soccer has sparked significant controversy, with the governing body expressing disapproval of her protest, arguing that it contradicts the organization’s values and expectations for their representatives.

While Rapinoe has not faced immediate punishment for her actions, U.S. Soccer has indicated that her conduct will be reevaluated should she continue to kneel throughout the remainder of the season. During the match against the Netherlands, Rapinoe faced backlash from spectators, some of whom called for her to stand during the anthem, highlighting the polarized opinions surrounding her form of activism.

Despite the potential repercussions, Rapinoe remains steadfast in her commitment to her cause. She expressed her willingness to accept possible suspension for her continued protest, stating, ""As of now I plan to keep kneeling."" Her resolve reflects a deeper intention to further her activism beyond mere gestures, as she aims to develop a more robust plan for her advocacy moving forward.

The situation surrounding Rapinoe has underscored the tension between sports, national pride, and social justice issues. As one of the most recognizable figures in women's sports, her actions could have far-reaching implications, not only for her career but also for the ongoing conversation about athletes using their platforms to address societal issues.

With the season progressing and U.S. Soccer watching closely, the eyes of the sports world remain on Rapinoe as she navigates the challenges ahead. Her bravery in the face of opposition is already drawing applause from supporters who believe her protest resonates with critical social justice themes being addressed nationally.

As this story develops, the intersection of sports and activism continues to unfold, embodying the complexities of personal conviction in a public arena.",0.0,9.0,421.0,0.0,0.0,425.0,0.6428571428571429,0.021176470588235293

It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed.

Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing.

Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.

Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.”

Below is the offending post:

“I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??”

After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.

Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people.

Brody Jenner, a well-known reality star and son of Caitlyn Jenner, has ignited controversy with recent comments made on Twitter regarding incidents involving police shootings. In his tweet, Jenner stated that not every police-related incident is tied to race,and included the phrase ""All Lives Matter,"" a phrase that has become a lightning rod in discussions surrounding racial justice and police reform.

Responses to Jenner's tweet were swift and fierce, with numerous critics lashing out at him for what they perceive as an insensitivity to the racial dynamics often at play in these situations. Many labeled him a ""terrible person,"" pointing to his identity as a white, straight, cis-gender male as a factor in their outrage. The backlash underscores the heightened sensitivity surrounding discussions about race, policing, and social justice in contemporary society.

In his original tweet, Jenner expressed frustration with how police incidents are reported in the news. He emphasized the importance of complying with police orders, implying that adherence to law enforcement directives should be a universal expectation, irrespective of an individual’s racial identity. He posed a pointed question about the logic behind exiting a vehicle while allegedly armed, suggesting that individuals should take proactive steps to communicate to officers that they are unarmed.

However, Jenner's comments did not alleviate the criticism directed at him; in fact, they seemed to further inflame the situation. Following the initial wave of backlash, he took to Instagram to post additional comments that critics argued only compounded their irritation. This action seemed to illustrate a disconnect between Jenner's perspective and those of his detractors, leading to even more heated discussions on social media platforms.

Some observers noted a pattern in the discourse, suggesting that individuals with strong liberal views may be prone to taking offense easily, often seeking out causes for negative reactions. This observation highlights the cultural and ideological divisions present in discussions about race, policing, and justice. 

As the backlash continued to unfold, it became clear that Jenner's comments have struck a nerve in the ongoing dialogue surrounding race and police interactions. His statements raise questions not only about personal accountability during police encounters but also about the broader societal implications of such discussions, particularly in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement and its emphasis on addressing systemic racism within law enforcement.

Although Jenner may have intended to express a viewpoint on personal responsibility, the repercussions of his comments reflect a deeper divide in public opinion on this sensitive issue. The discussion around police shootings and race remains a contentious topic, one that highlights the complexities of social dialogue in today's internet-driven culture.",-17.0,-13.0,476.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.03571428571428571,505.0,-0.7647058823529411,-0.02574257425742574

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.”

Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past.

Story Continued Below

“Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.”

The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].”

Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.”

“I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”

In a recent statement, Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, harshly criticized former President Donald Trump for his refusal to apologize for his role in the ""birther"" movement— a conspiracy theory that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama. Brazile described Trump's actions as a ""wound that won't heal,"" highlighting the broader implications of the movement on America's ongoing struggles with race and identity. 

Brazile's remarks kicked off a powerful conversation surrounding the historical and emotional weight of the birther controversy, particularly its long-lasting effects on the African-American community. She drew a poignant connection to her recent visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, where she reflected on the arduous journey her ancestors faced in their pursuit of documentation and recognition. The struggles of her forebearers serve as a reminder of the challenges that persist within the context of today's political climate.

Having grown up in a context where her family endured a generational absence of birth certificates, Brazile expressed a deeply personal connection to the issue at hand. This absence speaks volumes about the systemic inequities that have affected African-Americans throughout history. The birther movement, in her view, acts as a painful reminder of these historical injustices, reopening wounds that many would prefer to forget.

In a recent presidential debate, Trump was confronted with questions regarding the birther issue but shifted the blame to Hillary Clinton, claiming she was the one who initially introduced the conspiracy theory. This evasion of accountability is what Brazile finds particularly troubling. ""Trump’s comments are shameful,"" she stated, reinforcing that rather than addressing the pain his remarks incite, he chooses to exploit it for political gain.

Brazile pointed out the implausibility of expecting an apology from Trump, knowing that he has consistently refrained from expressing any remorse for the hurt he has caused. Nevertheless, she asserted that the continuation of discussions surrounding the birther movement is essential for understanding and healing the racial divides in America. Each dialogue reopens historical wounds, necessitating a collective acknowledgment of the past to pave the way for a more inclusive future.

The birther movement has become emblematic of a more extensive discourse on race in the United States, encapsulating the deep-seated prejudices and tensions that have permeated American society. Brazile’s critique serves not only as a condemnation of Trump’s refusal to take responsibility but also as a call to action for all Americans to engage critically with their history. 

As the nation navigates these complex issues, Brazile's insights serve as a reminder of the importance of accountability, understanding, and acknowledgment in addressing the pain of the past. Moving forward, it is imperative to confront these historical wounds with sensitivity and courage, fostering an environment where healing and growth can take place.

Brazile's poignant commentary continues to resonate, urging policymakers and citizens alike to reflect on the historical implications of their actions and rhetoric. Only through such reflection can the nation hope to bridge its divides and move toward a more equitable society. As the discussion surrounding the birther movement persists, the dialogue it ignites remains crucial to America’s ongoing quest for racial justice and reconciliation.",-17.0,-17.0,540.0,-1.0,-0.03148148148148148,606.0,-0.8095238095238095,-0.028052805280528052
Real_38-Webpage,US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike,"(CNN) The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.

Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials.

That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.

Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.

But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

“This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.”

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

“If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.”

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

“That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.”

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

Kimmel's remarks delved into the intersection of politics and entertainment, reflecting on the media’s influence in shaping public perception.

In a pointed jab at Hollywood's elite, Kimmel highlighted the remarkable diversity among this year’s nominees, stating that the Emmys’ inclusivity was so pronounced that even the Oscars would be envious. His comments resonated with the audience, as they underscored a shift in the entertainment industry towards greater representation.

Kimmel went on to turn his focus to Trump, humorously suggesting that the former president’s existence could have been far more subdued had it not been for television. “Without TV, he’d probably be living a quieter life with his wife,” Kimmel quipped, eliciting laughter from the crowd. This dig set the stage for a deeper critique of the forces that elevated Trump to the national spotlight.

The comedian did not shy away from tackling the creator of “Celebrity Apprentice,” Mark Burnett, whom Kimmel held partially responsible for Trump’s political ascent. “Thanks to Burnett, we no longer need to watch reality shows, because we’re all living in one,” Kimmel remarked sarcastically, drawing attention to the surreal nature of contemporary politics.

As the audience absorbed Kimmel's sharp delivery, he continued to engage in playful mockery, suggesting that Burnett could well be the first individual thrown over Trump’s metaphorical wall if the former president's supporters ever voted against their own interests. This line not only underscored Kimmel’s skillful use of humor in discussing serious issues, but it also reflected the complicated relationship between media, celebrity, and political power.

Kimmel’s remarks at the Emmys served as a striking reminder of the ways in which comedy remains a potent vehicle for political commentary, particularly in a time when the lines between entertainment and reality are increasingly blurred. The evening was a reminder that in the landscape of pop culture, humor can be both an escape and a piercing critique of the status quo.",13.0,15.0,391.0,0.7222222222222222,0.03324808184143223,411.0,1.1538461538461537,0.0364963503649635

Real_41-Webpage,Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business',"During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump’s debate performance Monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.""

Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""

""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'You’re fired.' They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.""

During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way.""

""When you’re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump.

The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart.""

""He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.

""If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord,"" Biden said about the debate. ""What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.""",http://abcn.ws/2d3YEVr,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"Abc News,More Arlette",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382,"{""fb_title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""description"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@arlettesaenz"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:43:23"", ""keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate""}","- Vice President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump’s debate performance during a rally in Philadelphia.

At a rally in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden fiercely criticized former President Donald Trump’s recent debate performance, expressing deep outrage over Trump’s comments concerning the ongoing housing crisis in America. Biden did not hold back in condemning what he described as Trump's lack of moral clarity, questioning the integrity behind his statements and decisions that affect everyday Americans.

Biden starkly contrasted Trump's perspectives with the moral standards upheld by previous presidents, including those from the Republican Party. He argued that Trump’s views signify a departure from the fundamental sensibilities and values that have historically guided American leadership. Drawing on the legacy of presidents such as Ronald Reagan, Biden asserted that a true leader would never find joy in the suffering of others – a sentiment he feels Trump blatantly disregards.

In his remarks, Biden pointedly referred to Trump’s so-called ""business"" rationale for profiting from the collapse of the housing market, a stance that the vice president found both troubling and indicative of a larger issue. He emphasized that Trump's justifications reveal a concerning priority placed on profit over people, harming the very citizens who work tirelessly to make ends meet.

Additionally, Biden took aim at Trump’s controversial assertion that not paying taxes is a sign of being ""smart."" The vice president urged the audience to recognize the heavy tax burdens that ordinary Americans bear, highlighting the unfairness and immorality of such a claim. He expressed palpable anger over Trump’s cavalier attitude toward taxation, particularly in relation to hardworking individuals striving to support their families.

Wrapping up his address, Biden underscored that Trump’s views reflect a deeply cynical outlook toward the American populace and the critical electoral choice facing the nation. By emphasizing these points, Biden not only reinforced his position against Trump’s approach but also sought to rally support for a vision of governance that prioritizes empathy, integrity, and respect for the American people.

As the political landscape continues to unfold, Biden's critiques signal a broader campaign strategy aimed at drawing clear distinctions between his leadership ideals and those offered by Trump. The rally encapsulated the vice president's commitment to advocating for the interests of everyday citizens while challenging what he perceives to be the dangerous implications of Trump’s viewpoints in the context of American values and democracy.",-5.0,-10.0,453.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.011037527593818985,452.0,-0.7142857142857143,-0.022123893805309734
Real_42-Webpage,National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6,"Story highlights Hillary Clinton has a 6-point lead over Donald Trump in a four way race, according to a new poll

Clinton has the edge over Trump on a number of key issues in the poll ahead of the first presidential debate

(CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.

The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.

Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.

Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.

Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament.

As the race for the presidency heats up, a new national poll indicates that Hillary Clinton holds a 6-point lead over Donald Trump, just days before the first presidential debate. According to the latest McClatchy-Marist poll, Clinton garners 45% support from voters, while Trump trails at 39%. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is polling at 10%, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4%.

Similar results have emerged from a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, which found Clinton leading with 43% compared to Trump's 37%. These figures suggest a competitive landscape as both candidates prepare for their first direct confrontation.

Clinton's strength is particularly notable among minority voters. She enjoys overwhelming support from black voters, where she leads by an impressive 93% to 3% over Trump. Likewise, Clinton also leads among Latino voters, claiming 74% support compared to Trump’s 16%. However, her support among Latino voters drops to 60% when third-party candidates are included.

Despite her lead, both candidates face challenges as they battle low favorability ratings, with Clinton at 40% and Trump slightly lower at 37%. Trump holds a slight edge in being perceived as ""honest and trustworthy,"" receiving 44% of the vote in that category compared to 36% for Clinton. When it comes to perceptions of who ""shares their values"" and ""cares about people like them,"" both candidates are viewed evenly.

Clinton, however, outshines Trump when it comes to the assessment of who ""knows how to do the job"" and possesses the proper temperament for the presidency, underscoring a key area where she may potentially sway undecided voters.

Real_43-Webpage,“Public School Forced My Child To,"7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

“Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.”

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

“During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.”

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

“Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.”

It referenced the jihad as,

“a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years.

A public high school in Maryland, La Plata High School, is facing serious allegations of indoctrinating its students with Islamic teachings. The claims come to light through a lawsuit filed by local parents, John and Melissa Wood, who are being represented by the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative legal organization.

The lawsuit accuses the school of coercing students to profess the Shahada, the Islamic statement of faith, and requiring them to memorize the five pillars of Islam. John Wood, who has expressed concerns regarding the school's curriculum, alleges that his attempts to raise these issues led to his being banned from school property. This claim has added an element of controversy to an already heated debate about religious education in public schools.

Richard Thompson, President of the Thomas More Law Center, outlined the gravity of the situation. He stated that Wood’s daughter was compelled to recite the Shahada, which the Woods believe undermines her Christian faith. This claim is a focal point of the lawsuit, which argues that the teachings within the school favor Islamic teachings at the expense of Christianity and Judaism.

Further allegations within the lawsuit suggest a lack of balanced religious instruction in La Plata High School's curriculum. The Woods claim that students were not exposed to biblical teachings or any non-Islamic texts. Additionally, they allege that students were subjected to disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope, fostering an imbalance in religious education.

Documents referenced in the lawsuit claim that teachers instructed students that most Muslims possess stronger faith than average Christians. These assertions, according to the Woods, reflect a troubling bias in the educational content being delivered to students. One particular handout purportedly claimed that the Koran does not endorse martyrdom through suicide bombings and emphasized that the majority of Muslims do not live violently, which the Woods argue contradicts established Christian teachings.

The alleged incidents reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year, raising questions about the school’s adherence to educational standards regarding religious equality and instruction. As the lawsuit unfolds, it has drawn attention to broader discussions about the role of religion in public education.

Despite the gravity of the allegations, officials from Charles County Public Schools have yet to comment on the lawsuit, citing that they have not received the formal legal documents pertaining to the case. This lack of response has left many questions unanswered regarding the school's curriculum and its approach to teaching about different religions.

Interestingly, organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Freedom From Religion Foundation have remained silent on the issue, sparking discussions about the implications of this silence in the face of such allegations.

As the case progresses, it remains to be seen how La Plata High School will respond to these claims and what implications the lawsuit will have for the future of religious education in public schools in Maryland and beyond. The outcome could influence not only the specific case at La Plata but also set a precedent for how religious teachings are handled in educational institutions nationwide.",-5.0,-38.0,511.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.009784735812133072,579.0,-1.8095238095238095,-0.06563039723661486

Real_47-Webpage,KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism,"“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can’t I?

Rock legend Gene Simmons, famous for his role as the flamboyant frontman of KISS and a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, recently shared his thoughts on Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man suspected in the NY/NJ bombings. In an eye-catching interview with TMZ, Simmons made headlines with his candid commentary, suggesting that Rahami “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend,” a remark designed to provoke conversation and highlight his views on the criminal justice system.

Simmons did not shy away from discussing broader issues surrounding terrorism, particularly his concerns about Islamic extremism in America. He stressed the urgency for more proactive measures, advocating for profiling as a necessary tool in combating such threats. “Nobody says the word ‘profile,’” Simmons remarked, emphasizing the importance of this approach during wartime.

While recognizing that profiling might seem unfair to some individuals, Simmons expressed a pragmatic acceptance of this reality. He noted, “That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist,” highlighting his belief that difficult decisions may need to be made in the interest of national security.

As his statements have stirred debate over the ethics of profiling in law enforcement, Simmons's comments continue to resonate amid ongoing discussions about security measures in the United States. His direct approach reflects a growing sentiment among some commentators who advocate for a more vigorous stance against perceived threats. 

The interview concluded with a light-hearted suggestion that Simmons could find a new calling in national security if Donald Trump were to be elected President. The idea of the rock star stepping into a political role has prompted laughter from fans and critics alike, though his serious observations on terrorism and security reflect deep concerns prevalent in today's society.

Simmons’s remarks serve as a reminder of the intersecting worlds of pop culture and politics, provoking thought on important national issues while providing a glimpse into the mind of one of rock music's most iconic figures.",12.0,-3.0,381.0,0.5714285714285714,0.031496062992125984,381.0,-0.25,-0.007874015748031496
Real_48-Webpage,"Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'","(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""

""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""

Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.

Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.

Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.

""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""

""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""

""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""

Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016

In response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.

Danny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.",http://cnn.it/2cQyS4N,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,"Dan Merica,Eugene Scott",http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161118161709-cop-punches-woman-in-face-thumb-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718110446-02-officer-mohamed-noor-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717224427-justine-ruszczyk-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170711043320-georgia-police-beating-jnd-orig-vstop-00000612-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170104090632-north-carolina-school-body-slam-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170720014308-baltimore-pd-body-cam-video-release-02-large-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170626185531-jordan-edwards-roy-oliver-split-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712182221-florida-state-attorney-aramis-ayala-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170818111936-dashcam-video-ohio-violent-arrest-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160707080401-philando-castile-facebook-2-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520225617-georgia-man-tased-death-police-pkg-00012201-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717113139-australian-woman-minneapolis-police-shooting-nr-00000812-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718090944-betsy-hodges-7-18-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712054244-louisiana-couple-police-shooting-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160428084627-baltimore-teen-replica-gun-shot-dnt-00001823-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html,"{""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""author"": ""Eugene Scott and Dan Merica, CNN"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-col,col-controversial-police-incidents-"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Election 2016, US election, Tulsa, shooting, politics, Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable' - CNNPolitics"", ""article"": {""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202""}, ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-21T14:20:33Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced plans to implement best practices to prevent police-involved shootings.

In a bold initiative to confront the escalating issue of police-involved shootings, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced plans for implementing best practices aimed at preventing these tragic incidents. This announcement comes on the heels of a spate of police shootings, particularly the recent incidents in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Terence Crutcher was killed, and Charlotte, North Carolina, where Keith Lamont Scott lost his life. The campaign emphasizes a multifaceted approach designed to address systemic issues within law enforcement and foster improved community relations.

At the core of Clinton's strategy are two main components that aim to transform the policing landscape across the nation. The first component seeks to establish national standards for managing police encounter situations. Currently, these encounters are dictated by local policies, leading to significant disparities in how law enforcement operates from one community to another. By setting uniform standards, Clinton's campaign aims to create a framework that all police departments can follow, enhancing accountability and consistency in responses to potentially volatile situations.

The second component of the plan focuses on enhancing relationships between police forces and minority communities. Clinton's approach advocates for community policing initiatives and the allocation of more resources to facilitate better interaction and understanding between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. Mook highlighted that it’s critical for police departments to engage proactively with minority populations to build trust and improve public safety.

Clinton's condemnation of ""systematic racism"" has also been a pivotal aspect of her response to the recent police shootings. She described the events in Tulsa and Charlotte as a reflection of a broader issue that cannot be ignored any longer. ""These incidents are unbearable and intolerable,” Clinton stated, asserting the urgent need to tackle systemic racism within the criminal justice system. Her comments underscore a recognition that poor relations between law enforcement and communities of color often stem from deeper societal issues.

In addressing these concerns, Mook emphasized the necessity of training for police officers to ensure that local policies are in line with the national standards being proposed. Such training would be essential not only in mitigating the risk of violent confrontations but also in changing the prevailing culture within many law enforcement agencies. He pointed out that the need for this type of comprehensive training is urgent, particularly in light of recent events.

Alongside these initiatives, Clinton has expressed a commitment to confronting implicit bias directly with white Americans. She contends that acknowledging and addressing these biases is crucial in understanding the unequal treatment that minority groups experience within the criminal justice system. ""It's time we have an honest conversation about the systemic disparities that exist and how we can overcome them,"" Clinton has argued, emphasizing the importance of white Americans participating in this dialogue.

Recognizing the complexities involved, Clinton has also made it clear that while there are many honorable police officers who work diligently to serve their communities, the system they operate within must undergo significant changes. The focus on reform is not just about individual officers but about rethinking how the entire law enforcement system functions to better protect and serve all citizens equally.

The urgency of these conversations is punctuated by ongoing investigations following the tragic shooting of Terence Crutcher. Both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched inquiries into possible federal civil rights violations connected to the incident. As scrutiny of police actions intensifies, Clinton's proposals may become pivotal in shaping the discourse around law enforcement reform in the coming months.

As the campaign progresses, Clinton’s comprehensive approach to addressing police-involved shootings and systemic racism could resonate with voters concerned about justice and equality in policing practices. With Mook at the helm of this initiative, the campaign is poised to make these issues a focal point in the lead-up to the election, potentially influencing both public sentiment and policy changes at a national level.",-5.0,-5.0,656.0,-0.14705882352941177,-0.007621951219512195,727.0,-0.18518518518518517,-0.0068775790921595595
Real_49-Webpage,Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked,"Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked

Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager.

Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative.

Story Continued Below

“He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?”

Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.

Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.”

“So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked.

“You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.

Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway confirmed that Trump possesses a specific strategy aimed at tackling the terrorist organization but intends to keep key elements private to avoid tipping off the enemy.

Conway criticized Clinton's decision to publish her own ISIS strategy on her campaign website, suggesting that such transparency may hinder effective action. ""While it's important for voters to be informed, there is a line where revealing detailed strategies could be counterproductive,"" she stated.

Trump's remarks about ""knocking the hell out of ISIS"" have resonated with many supporters, but he has refrained from discussing the particulars of his approach. This stance aligns with his campaign's perspective that certain operational details should not be disclosed publicly.

Addressing concerns about whether voters should be privy to specifics surrounding Trump's plan, Conway asserted that while certain information would be shared during the debate, the overarching strategy would remain confidential. ""We will communicate Trump's perspective clearly, assuring voters that he has a framework in mind to combat ISIS effectively,"" she explained.

As the debate approaches, all eyes will be on Trump to see if he indeed reveals his plan in response to Clinton's inquiries, or if he will maintain his strategy's confidentiality.

Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists.

During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear.

""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.""

""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens.

In a poignant address during his final United Nations General Assembly meeting in midtown Manhattan, President Barack Obama reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to combatting ISIS, following a spate of violence that raised concerns among citizens. 

The President's remarks come on the heels of recent bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, which prompted an immediate response from law enforcement agencies. He praised their swift actions that facilitated the ongoing investigations into these incidents, particularly highlighting the response to a bombing in Chelsea that injured dozens of people.

Conveying a message of resilience, Obama urged Americans not to yield to fear, stating that succumbing to such emotions only serves the interests of terrorists. He reassured the public that the strength of the American character remains robust, particularly in the face of adversity. ""The residents of New York and New Jersey are tough and resilient,"" he noted, commending their ability to carry on with their lives despite the looming threats.

Expressing pride in the collective strength and unity of the American people against organizations like ISIS, Obama’s words resonated as a rallying call to enhance national solidarity. The President emphasized the importance of standing together in the face of extremism, reinforcing that unity is a crucial weapon in the fight against terrorism.

As investigations continue, the President's comments serve as both a reassurance to a concerned public and a declaration of determination from the United States in its ongoing battle against radical threats. His call for resilience and commitment to justice highlights the nation’s resolve to confront violence head-on, ensuring safety for all citizens.",-6.0,11.0,331.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.01812688821752266,314.0,1.1,0.03503184713375796
Real_50-Webpage,Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity,"United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.

The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.

At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.

""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.

Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""

JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45

""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.

""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""

The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.

A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.

Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.

""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""

Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.

""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.

""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.

The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.

""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement.

But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.

""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.""

The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.

The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.

""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""

Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.

""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.""

But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.

""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""

As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.

The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.

Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.

And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp.

In a profound address at the United Nations, President Barack Obama called upon nations to take decisive action in response to the escalating global refugee crisis, which he described as ""of epic proportions."" His speech comes at a time of significant political backlash within the United States against the acceptance of refugees from the Middle East, raising questions about the nation’s role in addressing this humanitarian emergency.

During his address, President Obama emphasized the moral obligation that all countries share in aiding displaced persons, stating that the hope and future of millions depend on collective international efforts. To reinforce this commitment, he convened a Leaders' Summit on Refugees, which aimed to galvanize support and resources toward alleviating the immense hardships faced by refugees worldwide.

Rejecting the notion of building walls to deter refugees, Obama pointed to the devastating situation in Syria as a stark example of the need for compassion and action. With 4.8 million people displaced from their homes due to the ongoing conflict, he underscored that the refugee crisis is not just a humanitarian challenge but also a security issue that warrants global collaboration.

Drawing historical parallels, President Obama invoked the lessons of the past, notably the collective failure to respond to the plight of Jewish families fleeing Nazi Germany. He cautioned that such inaction represents a stain on our collective conscience, urging world leaders to learn from history and act decisively to protect those in need.

A report from the United Nations highlighted the scale of the crisis, revealing that in 2015 alone, approximately 65.3 million people were displaced globally. Of this staggering number, about 21.3 million individuals were classified as refugees. Obama’s address and the subsequent summit were aimed at addressing this alarming reality by creating a coordinated response among nations.

The Leaders' Summit on Refugees sought to achieve several key objectives: to increase international funding for refugee assistance by at least 30%, to double the number of permanent resettlements, and to enhance refugees' access to education and work rights. These commitments, if fulfilled, could significantly change the landscape for millions of displaced individuals whose lives have been upended.

While there was optimistic rhetoric surrounding the summit, many aid groups expressed skepticism about whether the intended actions would translate into concrete results. Even as leaders gathered to discuss progressive policies and initiatives, doubts lingered regarding the adequacy of the commitments made and the ability to meet the critical needs of refugees on the ground.

In a bid to shift the narrative, the United States announced plans to increase its refugee intake from 85,000 refugees in 2016 to 110,000 in 2017. However, this move was met with resistance from several members of Congress, highlighting the ongoing tension between humanitarian obligations and domestic political realities.

At the summit, leaders from various nations expressed satisfaction with new humanitarian contributions slated for global refugee efforts. Notably, the world aimed to achieve an additional $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing, signifying a collective acknowledgment of the crisis's urgency and a commitment to bolster support systems.

The continuing conflict in Syria continues to serve as a painful reminder of the larger global refugee crisis, disproportionately impacting the developing nations of the ""global south."" These countries often bear the brunt of refugee inflows, straining their resources and infrastructure while seeking to provide care and support for those fleeing the horrors of war.

As global leaders focused their attention on comprehensive solutions to the refugee crisis, public awareness campaigns deployed innovative strategies to humanize the struggle faced by migrants. In London, volunteers came together to create a poignant ""life jacket graveyard,"" symbolizing the tragic loss of life among those attempting to cross the Mediterranean in search of safety. This stark visual representation served to highlight the millions who have perished in transit, underscoring the urgency for effective and compassionate solutions.

As President Obama concludes his address and the events of the summit unfold, the international community stands at a critical juncture, faced with the challenge of transforming pledges into actionable outcomes that can change the lives of millions. The ongoing discourse surrounding refugee policies, the responsibilities of nations, and the moral duty to assist those in distress will remain a pivotal topic of discussion in the months to come.

In summary, President Obama’s address to the United Nations brought to the forefront the pressing issue of the global refugee crisis. His appeal for collective action and moral responsibility resonates amidst growing doubts and resistance. The outcome of the summit will not only dictate the immediate future of refugee assistance but also challenge nations to confront their own values and obligations toward those who have lost everything in search of safety and hope. As the world watches and waits, the actions taken in the wake of the summit will ultimately reveal whether nations can rise to meet this remarkable humanitarian challenge with conviction and compassion.",-13.0,-1.0,1293.0,-0.325,-0.010054137664346482,910.0,-0.03333333333333333,-0.001098901098901099
Real_51-Webpage,Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings,"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues

It's a recurring theme of his campaign

Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions.

The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law.

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.

""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

In a fiery rally attended by over 8,000 supporters, former President Donald Trump unleashed strong criticisms of Hillary Clinton’s national security strategies, branding them as ""weak and ineffective."" This speech came just two days following a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, amplifying the urgency of his message.

Speaking at his first rally since the chilling incidents in New York and New Jersey, Trump took the opportunity to promote his hardline immigration policies, emphasizing the need for a resolute stance against domestic terror suspects. He proposed that these individuals should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants,"" reflecting his administration's commitment to a tougher approach on terror-related issues.

Trump did not shy away from taking shots at Clinton, accusing her of being more aggressive toward his supporters than towards Islamist terrorism. He invoked a memorable statement from Clinton, who had previously referred to his supporters as being part of a ""basket of deplorables,"" questioning why her strong rhetoric did not extend to radical Islamic threats.

The rally underscored Trump's ongoing focus on national security as a pivotal issue in his political narrative, especially in the aftermath of recent attacks that have rattled the nation. His remarks sought to position himself as the candidate capable of addressing these pressing security concerns more effectively than his opponents.",-16.0,-13.0,262.0,-1.7777777777777777,-0.061068702290076333,256.0,-1.625,-0.05078125
Real_52-Webpage,In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism,"Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.

The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.

But the ""he said/she said"" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics.

Story Continued Below

While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?

In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.

Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.

But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.

As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both ""he said and she said""—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.

One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?

I don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.

The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.

Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.

Obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.

The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.”

Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.

The last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”

If you’re not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.

In recent discussions surrounding the state of journalism, particularly in the political realm, the method known as ""he said/she said"" has faced increasing scrutiny. A particularly notable case arose from a recent New York Times article by Michael Barbaro, in which he labeled former President Donald Trump a ""pitiful serial liar."" This bold statement has prompted a wave of criticism from various commentators and academics, who argue that the traditional approach of reporting both sides has become a necessary safeguard against a slide into one-sided political narratives.

One of the most vocal critics of Barbaro's article is NYU professor Jay Rosen. He contends that the ""he said/she said"" style of journalism—which often seeks to provide equal representation to contrasting viewpoints—can create a dangerous false equivalence between truth and falsehood. The concern lies in the potential for this reporting style to treat lies and facts as if they hold equal weight. Critics argue that this approach can obfuscate the truth and leave audiences unsure about where reality lies, especially in a landscape saturated with misinformation.

Barbaro's piece has, nonetheless, drawn praise for its direct approach. By labelling Trump's statements as lies rather than merely presenting them alongside counterarguments, it steps away from a mechanical balance of reporting that often blurs the lines between fact and fiction. This directness, supporters note, may resonate with a populace increasingly frustrated by the spate of falsehoods permeating political discourse. The debate ignites questions about the ethics of journalism and the obligations reporters have to their audiences.

However, this shift away from the ""he said/she said"" paradigm—while appealing to some—may not be as beneficial for the overall landscape of political reporting as many believe. Standard journalistic practice advocates for rigorous due diligence, which includes engaging with both sides of a story. This format not only allows for a comprehensive assessment of political claims but also empowers readers to arrive at informed decisions based on a full spectrum of perspectives.

The vital importance of dissenting voices in journalism cannot be overstated. Looking back through history, minority opinions and dissenting views have often led to societal advancements and deeper understanding of complex issues. The author draws on insights from scientific history to illustrate this point effectively. For instance, the rejection of eugenics, once a dominant paradigm, demonstrates how prevailing beliefs can be challenged by those who dare to dissent. Similarly, the eventual acceptance of plate tectonics fundamentally altered our understanding of geology, suggesting that progress often emerges from rigorous questioning and debate.

Advocating for the necessity of ""he said/she said"" journalism, the author posits that maintaining an environment where open inquiry is possible is of paramount importance. This methodology encourages balanced reporting and helps prevent bias from creeping into the narrative. When journalists strive to present all sides of an argument, they not only honor their ethical commitment to factual reporting but also foster a culture of accountability among public figures. 

The risks of presenting information through a strictly partisan lens cannot be overstated. Readers who only engage with news that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or presents a one-sided version of events are susceptible to misinformation. This susceptibility underscores the importance of balanced reporting, particularly in today’s polarized environment, where sources of information can shift dangerously close to echo chambers. 

In conclusion, while Barbaro's approach to denouncing Trump’s falsehoods has garnered attention and admiration, it also raises substantial concerns about the future of political reporting. The abandonment of ""he said/she said"" journalism may appear attractive to some, yet it risks undermining the foundational principles of journalistic integrity and due diligence. By engaging with both sides of the narrative, journalists can ensure a more informed public and help cultivate a democracy that thrives on open dialogue and a commitment to truth. In an age when misinformation looms large, balanced reporting should remain a cornerstone of responsible journalism.",6.0,17.0,2265.0,0.06593406593406594,0.0026490066225165563,738.0,0.5862068965517241,0.023035230352303523
Real_53-Webpage,Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. […] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”

Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has garnered attention for his recent appearances on Fox News, where he has vehemently criticized the Black Lives Matter movement. Clarke has gone as far as to compare the organization to international terrorists, igniting further debate on law enforcement's role in addressing social justice issues.

A staunch supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Clarke publicly endorsed the candidate during the Republican National Convention, solidifying his alignment with Trump's policies and rhetoric. However, his high-profile media presence has come under a cloud of controversy, particularly following the tragic death of inmate Terrill Thomas in the Milwaukee County Jail.

Thomas, who was arrested for a shooting, was found dead in his cell on April 24, nine days after his arrest. Eyewitness accounts from fellow inmates indicate that Thomas begged for water in the days leading up to his death. The medical examiner has classified Thomas's death as a homicide, attributing it to the actions of another person. Reports emerged stating that Thomas's water supply was cut off for six days, raising serious concerns about the conditions within the jail.

Inmates within the facility indicated that they had raised alarms with jailers about Thomas’s deteriorating condition and the lack of water access. An attorney has since confirmed receiving calls from inmates who reported similar issues regarding their own water supply, citing an unsettling pattern reminiscent of a prior incident in 2011 when another inmate succumbed under comparable circumstances.

Clarke’s role in the controversy extends beyond his media commentary and political endorsements. He is reportedly involved in a pro-Trump bus tour organized by a super PAC that supports the presidential candidate. Additionally, financial records reveal that Clarke earned over $150,000 in 2015 from speaking fees, travel reimbursements, and various gifts. This juxtaposition of his national political engagement while facing scrutiny over jail conditions raises critical questions about the state of prisoner rights and the accountability of law enforcement officials.

As the discourse surrounding Clarke and the Milwaukee County Jail continues, advocates for police reform and inmate rights are calling for a thorough investigation into Thomas's death and the systemic issues that may have contributed to this tragic incident.",-25.0,-26.0,375.0,-1.9230769230769231,-0.06666666666666667,425.0,-1.7333333333333334,-0.0611764705882353

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?”

In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

“I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

In a controversial move, Janet Brown, the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), has declared that fact-checking should not be incorporated into presidential debates. This decision is bound to stir heated discussions, particularly in light of the increasingly contentious political climate in the United States.

Brown's reasoning centers on the difficulties associated with distinguishing between what she refers to as ""big facts"" and ""little facts."" She argues that attempting to separate these different types of information could lead to unnecessary disputes over sources and interpretations. Critics of this stance, however, argue that the inability to fact-check could undermine the integrity of the debates and mislead the electorate.

This stance appears to resonate with the demands from Donald Trump’s campaign, effectively minimizing the likelihood of moderators confronting the former president over his well-documented history of frequent untruths. As political commentators and analysts have pointed out, Trump has a reputation for misrepresenting facts, reportedly lying approximately once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds on the campaign trail. 

Trump's catalog of misrepresentations spans a wide array of topics, notably false assertions regarding the Iraq War, misleading claims about healthcare policies, and exaggerated statistics about crime rates. Such assertions lend weight to the argument for the necessity of robust fact-checking in debates, especially when the truth is often at stake.

In stark contrast to Trump, Hillary Clinton is recognized for her relatively infrequent inaccuracies. While Clinton is not without her own missteps, analysts argue that her errors do not occur with the same alarming frequency as those attributed to Trump. This discrepancy raises further questions about the fairness of debate conditions, particularly when one candidate is seemingly afforded more leniency in presenting their claims.

The reaction from journalists and political commentators has been largely negative. Many have voiced concerns about the implications of a debate format that permits candidates to make unchecked claims. If moderators are stripped of their ability to fact-check, the fundamental role they serve in maintaining a fair and informed discourse could be severely compromised. Critics question how moderators can effectively facilitate meaningful discussions on policy if they are unable to address factual inaccuracies.

Supporters of Trump, on the other hand, are celebrating Brown's remarks. Many in his camp believe this approach will enhance their candidate's chances of success in the upcoming debates. Trump's ability to appeal to his base often hinges on strong rhetoric and a defiance of mainstream media narratives, and a lack of fact-checking seemingly aligns with this strategy.

In light of these developments, the article suggests that the responsibility for fact-checking may need to shift to voters and social media platforms during debates. As the landscape of political discourse evolves, the onus may increasingly fall on the electorate to discern fact from fiction, particularly when institutional safeguards fail to hold candidates accountable.

The debate over whether or not fact-checking should be a component of presidential debates raises larger questions about the health of democratic discourse in contemporary politics. As seen in previous electoral cycles, the veracity of claims made by candidates can have profound implications for public perception and voter behavior.

The decision to forego fact-checking may further exacerbate the polarization within American political discourse, as each side may retreat into their echo chambers, believing only their chosen narratives. In an era where misinformation can spread rapidly through social media, the stakes have never been higher for voters to critically engage with the information presented during debates.

In conclusion, Janet Brown's position on fact-checking in presidential debates not only reflects a tactical alignment with Donald Trump’s campaign strategy but also raises significant concerns among journalists, commentators, and concerned voters. By prioritizing a debate environment free from direct scrutiny, adherents of this approach risk undermining the essential goal of presidential debates: to provide voters with accurate and reliable information upon which to base their electoral decisions. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the expectation for accountability and truthfulness in candidates will remain a crucial aspect of the democratic process. With the stakes so high, the responsibility for ensuring a factually grounded discourse may, regrettably, fall on the shoulders of an increasingly fragmented electorate.",11.0,-18.0,839.0,0.3235294117647059,0.013110846245530394,786.0,-0.6206896551724138,-0.022900763358778626

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.

“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.

“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

In a reflective assessment of the recent debate between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway publicly praised Trump for exhibiting restraint in the face of his opponent’s aggressive attacks. Conway, a senior advisor to Trump’s campaign, emphasized the critical nature of this decision, deeming it a presidential virtue that could resonate positively with the electorate amidst a highly charged political atmosphere.

During the debate, Clinton took aim at Trump by accusing him of making derogatory comments about women, citing specific instances where she claimed he referred to women as ""pigs, slobs, and dogs."" This pointed critique was part of a broader strategy to question Trump’s character and fitness for the presidency. However, according to Conway, Trump’s choice not to retaliate harshly to these personal attacks was a testament to his capability as a leader.

In the aftermath of the debate, Trump himself acknowledged a moment of internal conflict, revealing that he had contemplated delivering a biting remark aimed at Clinton. However, he ultimately opted against it out of consideration for her family, who were in attendance. This decision was framed by Conway as an example of Trump's ability to exercise restraint and tact, qualities she suggested would serve him well in the Oval Office.

While Conway acknowledged the potential for Trump to confront Clinton regarding Bill Clinton’s past record with women, she noted that he refrained from doing so, highlighting a deliberate choice to maintain civility over aggression in a contentious campaigning environment. This was presented as an intentional strategy to appeal to voters who might favor a more respectful and measured approach to political discourse.

Conway was quick to critique Clinton’s performance during the debate, suggesting that she lacked a decisive ""knockout punch"" to convincingly counter Trump's arguments. According to Conway, Clinton appeared overly rehearsed and scripted, which could alienate voters seeking authentic and personable engagement. This characterization implied that Trump’s more spontaneous style of responding to questions could resonate more effectively with the audience, as opposed to Clinton’s reiteration of prepared talking points.

Moreover, Conway argued that Trump’s responses during the debate were direct and focused, establishing a stark contrast to Clinton’s approach. She pointed out that while Trump tackled the issues head-on, Clinton seemed more focused on sticking to her pre-planned messages instead of adapting to the dynamic nature of the debate. This difference, Conway suggested, could lead voters to question Clinton's ability to connect with them on pressing issues.

One significant point raised by Conway was the absence of a compelling vision for economic growth from Clinton during the debate. She contended that Clinton did not adequately address the critical concerns of voters who were eager for substantial change in the political landscape. This perceived lack of forward-thinking solutions could be detrimental to Clinton, as voters increasingly seek candidates who offer clear plans for improving their lives and communities.

In the context of Conway’s comments, it becomes clear that the dynamics of the debate are being interpreted through the lens of campaign strategy and voter appeal. Trump’s restraint, as portrayed by Conway, could be an asset in enhancing his image among undecided voters who may be weary of the typical partisan divisiveness found in modern political debates. 

As the campaign continues, both Trump’s and Clinton’s performances will likely shape the trajectory of the election. Conway’s reflections on debate conduct and style may also indicate a broader strategic narrative that the Trump campaign will continue to emphasize in its efforts to unite supporters and attract undecided voters. 

In a political landscape already marked by intense scrutiny and competition, Trump’s decision to exercise restraint may not only redefine his own image but could also challenge conventional expectations about how candidates engage with each other during critical moments of their campaigns. With the election looming, both candidates will need to navigate these complexities as they seek to capture the hearts and minds of the American electorate.",5.0,14.0,650.0,0.35714285714285715,0.007692307692307693,763.0,0.56,0.01834862385321101

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

[A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,,https://www.washingtonpost.com,{'$date': 1474243200000},,"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg&w=60,https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,"{""theme"": ""normal"", ""news_keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Washington Post"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste."", ""title"": ""France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery"", ""url"": ""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""image"": ""https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""unsafe-url"", ""twitter"": {""site"": ""@WashingtonPost"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""creator"": ""jameskmcauley""}, ""object-hash"": 1503984085, ""robots"": ""index,follow"", ""apple-itunes-app"": ""app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 500835072, ""app_id"": 41245586762}, ""keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste.""}","- France has become the first country to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils.

France has officially taken a bold step in environmental legislation by becoming the first nation to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils. This groundbreaking decision, established under the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, is set to take effect in 2020, marking a significant shift in the country’s approach to addressing waste and environmental impact.

The ban is part of France's broader strategy to foster a ""circular economy,"" which emphasizes the reduction of waste and the sustainable use of resources. The initiative aims not only to eliminate single-use plastics but also to encourage a culture of recycling and responsible consumption among the French populace. Exceptions will be made for products crafted from compostable and biosourced materials, ensuring that those looking to maintain convenience can still do so without contributing to environmental degradation.

This legislative move follows previous efforts to reduce plastic waste, most notably the prohibition of plastic bags in grocery stores that commenced in July. These measures highlight a growing concern in France regarding the rampant use of plastics and their severe consequences for the environment, including their significant role in climate change and pollution.

French President François Hollande has been vocal about the importance of this ban, linking it to the broader objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy across the nation. The President's support underscores the government’s commitment to spearheading environmental responsibility and fostering sustainable practices in daily life.

However, the move has sparked controversy. Critics have raised concerns that the ban may infringe upon European Union laws regarding the free movement of goods, potentially complicating trade and fostering economic disparity among member states. In response to the ban, Eamonn Bates from Pack2Go Europe has announced plans to challenge the legislation legally within the European Commission, arguing against the potential economic ramifications for businesses reliant on plastic products.

The introduction of the ban was not without its hurdles. Initially proposed in 2017, the rollout was delayed after concerns were raised regarding the impact of such changes on low-income families that rely heavily on affordable plastic utensils. The postponement allowed for further discussion about how to balance environmental needs with socio-economic realities, a challenge that many nations face as they advocate for greener policies.

As the 2020 implementation date approaches, this ban positions France at the forefront of global environmental initiatives. It signals a decisive shift in governmental policy aimed at creating a sustainable future. By prioritizing environmental health over convenience and economic growth in specific sectors, France hopes to set a precedent for other nations to follow suit in reducing plastic dependency.

As the discourse continues around the legality and practicality of the ban, the crux of the matter remains: How can nations effectively balance the urgent need for environmental preservation with the realities of consumer habits and economic dependency on traditional materials? As debates unfold leading into the ban’s effective date, France’s initiative may very well influence global perspectives on plastic usage and environmental legislation.",-14.0,10.0,529.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.026465028355387523,557.0,0.5,0.017953321364452424

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump.

""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,"" Ryan said.

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.

But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.

What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.

The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said.

As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first?

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – A wave of anger and speculation has swept through North Carolina following the police shooting of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, igniting riots and leading to widespread looting across the city. With tensions running high, protests erupted in Charlotte, prompting significant disruptions, including the shutdown of Interstate 85 as demonstrators took to the streets to voice their discontent.

The incident that triggered this unrest took place as members of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police were conducting a search for a suspect in the area. According to police Chief Kerr Putney, officers observed Scott exiting a vehicle while armed with a handgun. Putney stated that officers ordered Scott to drop the weapon, but rather than comply, Scott exited the vehicle again while still holding the gun, prompting the officers to fire in response to what they perceived as a significant threat.

In the wake of the shooting, a narrative has emerged portraying Scott as an innocent victim, raising questions about the police's version of events. This contrasting portrayal has fueled the already heightened emotions surrounding the case, as many view the police's account with skepticism. Community leaders and protestors have taken to social media to express their outrage, asserting that the details provided by officials might not reflect the true nature of the incident. 

Chief Putney addressed the public's concerns, emphasizing the importance of changing the narrative surrounding Scott’s death. He suggested that information circulating on social media may have misrepresented the circumstances leading to the shooting, resulting in increased speculation and unrest. ""There is a need to clarify the issues at hand and shape a more accurate narrative,"" he stated, highlighting the challenges of managing public perception in a highly charged environment.

In addition, Chief Putney expressed frustration towards individuals who criticize the police's decisions and actions without possessing an adequate understanding of law enforcement protocols. He suggested that these critiques often come from those less informed about the complexities of a situation, leading to an unfair assessment of the police's responses. 

The riots and looting that have followed Scott's shooting have further complicated the landscape, with local businesses suffering damage as protestors vent their anger. While some demonstrators focus on expressing their opposition to police brutality, others engage in violence and vandalism, overshadowing the primary message of the protests. 

As Charlotte faces the fallout from this tragic incident, the community remains divided. Many citizens are calling for transparency and accountability from law enforcement, demanding that the truth surrounding the events leading to Scott's death be uncovered. As protests continue to unfold, local leaders are urging calm while navigating the turbulent waters of public grief, anger, and the need for justice.

The situation in Charlotte is emblematic of the broader national conversations regarding police conduct and the systemic issues facing communities of color in America. In the face of widespread scrutiny, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, led by Chief Putney, faces the challenge of rebuilding trust within the community while enforcing the law amid rising tensions.

As residents of Charlotte grapple with the aftermath of this tragic shooting, it becomes increasingly clear that the discourse surrounding police actions and community relations will dominate conversations in the coming days and weeks, as all eyes remain focused on the unfolding developments in this urgent and complex situation.",-23.0,-45.0,562.0,-0.9583333333333334,-0.04092526690391459,622.0,-2.142857142857143,-0.07234726688102894

ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June.

The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

""The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,"" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. ""As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.""

Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.

Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.

Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.

President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change.

The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.”

And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.”

The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both.

""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012

""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,"" Obama said, ""that worries me.""

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is ""naturally occurring.""

Former President Barack Obama has reaffirmed his criticism of Donald Trump, maintaining that the Republican nominee lacks the necessary presidential preparation and temperament following a recent debate. In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Obama articulated his concerns about Trump's ability to handle serious global issues, including nuclear threats and climate change, underscoring a belief that the business mogul cannot be trusted with such critical challenges.

During the interview, Obama took the opportunity to praise Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's debate performance, highlighting her qualifications and the seriousness she brings to the campaign. The former president emphasized Clinton’s diligence and preparedness in comparison to Trump, whom he accused of failing to embody core American values, such as inclusion and opportunity for all citizens.

Obama expressed particular concern over Trump’s stance on nuclear proliferation and climate change, issues he considers crucial for the welfare of future generations. Trump’s remarks regarding defense obligations in East Asia, particularly suggesting that countries such as Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear capacities, alarmed the former president. He worries that such rhetoric undermines longstanding international norms surrounding nuclear proliferation.

Moreover, Obama criticized Trump’s past assertion that climate change is a “hoax” created by China, a claim that contradicts the scientific consensus on the urgent need for action against global warming. Obama’s comments highlight a significant chasm between the two candidates on environmental issues, reflecting a broader concern for sustainable policy decisions.

In response to Obama’s criticisms, Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, defended her candidate in a television interview, stating that Trump believes climate change is ""naturally occurring."" Conway’s remarks attempt to counteract Obama’s claims, yet the former president’s position underscores the broader debate over climate policy and preparedness for addressing global challenges.

As the election campaign continues, the contrasting visions between Trump and Clinton become increasingly apparent. Obama’s emphasis on serious-minded governance and trust when addressing pressing global issues resonates with many voters concerned about U.S. leadership on the international stage. As such debates unfold, questions about Trump’s approach to defense and environmental policy remain pivotal in shaping the discourse leading up to the election.",-7.0,-1.0,419.0,-0.5833333333333334,-0.016706443914081145,430.0,-0.07142857142857142,-0.002325581395348837
Real_60-Webpage,How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying “yes” to Fox News almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning, he is booked on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn’t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

In an apparent shift in campaign strategy, former President Donald Trump has recently concentrated most of his media interviews with Fox News, eschewing greater engagement with other major networks. This move marks a significant deviation from traditional practices for presidential nominees, who typically pursue a broader media landscape to reach undecided voters.

Trump’s recurrent appearances on Fox News programs, including staples such as “Fox & Friends” and “The O’Reilly Factor,” are part of his ongoing effort to galvanize his core supporters. By engaging with Fox News, Trump reportedly enjoys a platform where he can communicate directly with his base without the traditional pressures of challenging questions that might arise on rival networks.

The decision to limit interviews to Fox News demonstrates a calculated effort to strengthen his support base rather than expand it. While past strategies of successful political figures often included targeting swing districts and engaging undecided voters, Trump's current approach seems to shun this broader audience in favor of a more concentrated rallying of his existing supporters. Town halls with notable Fox News host Sean Hannity are also in the works, further emphasizing this targeted engagement strategy.

Critics have voiced concerns that such a Fox News-centric media strategy may alienate potential voters outside of Trump's established base. By avoiding difficult questions, especially concerning controversial issues like the birther conspiracy or his positions on terrorism, Trump may inadvertently limit his electoral reach. This could ultimately harm his ability to connect with a wider audience who may not share his views or who are still on the fence about their voting intentions.

Insights from the 2012 election underscore the risks associated with Trump's current approach. Analysts observed that candidates who focused exclusively on a narrow media base could face unexpected electoral setbacks, suggesting Trump’s strategy may be overly risky. As the campaign progresses, his reliance on friendly media outlets raises questions about his preparation for the broader challenges of a national election.

In conclusion, Trump’s ongoing commitment to Fox News as his primary media platform showcases a tactical decision aimed at solidifying his support among loyal followers. However, this could lead to potential pitfalls should he underestimate the implications of engaging with a wider electorate. As the 2024 presidential campaign heats up, observers will be closely watching how this narrow focus on Fox News influences Trump's overall viability as a candidate.",-1.0,21.0,421.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.0023752969121140144,455.0,1.3125,0.046153846153846156
Real_61-Webpage,“Why Aren’t I 50 Points Ahead?” – Eagle Rising,"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again.

Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.

But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.”

For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.

Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump?

At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question:

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

As the 2016 presidential election draws near, the air of certainty that once shrouded Hillary Clinton's campaign has begun to dissipate among liberal supporters. Initially, many believed her victory was all but guaranteed, viewing the election as a mere formality. However, recent developments have underscored the competitive nature of the race against Donald Trump, who has been capitalizing on media attention with a formidable campaign strategy.

Following the Democratic National Convention, it became increasingly apparent that the election was not as one-sided as many had anticipated. Amidst this growing realization, Clinton faced health issues that led some party members to contemplate a ""Plan B,"" sowing seeds of concern regarding her campaign's direction.

Recent polling data has further fueled anxiety among Democrats, revealing that Trump has been gaining traction in crucial battleground states. This alarming trend has prompted Clinton to reflect on her campaign's performance in a surprising moment during a Las Vegas event. While addressing supporters, she openly questioned why she wasn’t significantly ahead in the polls against Trump, signaling a shift from her earlier confidence.

During her appearance, Clinton addressed the Labor International Union, where she discussed vital issues including infrastructure and the minimum wage. Her remarks underscored the importance of rallying support from union members, a key demographic for her campaign. Clinton articulated the need for collective efforts, urging supporters to engage in critical conversations surrounding her policies and the implications of a Trump presidency.

As tensions rise and the stakes elevate, Clinton has taken a more assertive stance, calling on her supporters to “stage an intervention” for those contemplating a vote for Trump. This call to action emphasizes the campaign's strategy to counteract the narrative surrounding Trump's appeal by engaging voters in discussions founded on factual information. Her advocacy for thoughtful voter engagement exemplifies the campaign's shift towards addressing the unexpected challenges faced in these final weeks leading up to the election.

In an environment where political landscapes can shift rapidly, the Clinton campaign finds itself in a critical moment that demands not only fortitude but also a clear connection with the electorate. As the battle for the White House enters its final stretch, the resolve of both candidates will be tested in what promises to be a closely contested race.",11.0,22.0,413.0,0.6875,0.026634382566585957,433.0,1.375,0.050808314087759814

Over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, Bobby Knight said Wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like Donald Trump.

""There’s nobody that I’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right,"" Knight told an audience in Toledo, Ohio, his home state. ""And I think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United States. And there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been Donald Trump.""

Story Continued Below

Back on the campaign trail with Trump after several months, Knight extolled the Republican nominee as ""not just an American; he’s a world figure.""

""He’s known all over the world. Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together,"" the coach continued. ""United States around the world. A lot of businesses. Created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world.""

And Trump, Knight later indicated, is the person for the White House.

""Believe me when I tell you, I think you’re all gonna agree on this: Our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the United States of America,"" Knight said. He noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, ""immigration problems and on and on.""

Remarking on his study of history, Knight said that he had come to the conclusion that ""when I need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man I want to choose and the first man I want to see.""

Knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't ""dress as well as politicians dress, but I want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, I wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""

""And I think that when you leave, I hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the United States,"" Knight said.

Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it. Although Islamic terrorism would seem to be the most likely explanation, there have been “mad bombers” who’ve done this sort of thing before (See Ted Kaczynski & George Metesky).

Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation.

That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.

An alarming discovery unfolded in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where authorities found three pipe bombs and two smaller devices at a local train station. The unsettling find has heightened security concerns in the region, particularly following similar incidents involving pipe bombs at the Jersey Shore and in New York.

Elizabeth Mayor has confirmed that a bag containing wires and pipes was located in a trash can near the NJ Transit station, prompting an immediate response from federal law enforcement. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) is currently on the scene, working to assess the situation and gather more information about these dangerous devices.

Speculation about the incidents suggests that they may be the work of a small team or an individual, notably due to the proximity of the bomb-related discoveries. Authorities are fervently investigating possible motives behind the threats, with Islamic terrorism emerging as a likely factor. However, it's important to note that historical occurrences of ""mad bombers"" have also played a role in similar past cases, leaving room for multiple interpretations.

Adding to the complexity of the investigation, the FBI recently arrested five individuals linked to a separate investigation surrounding the Chelsea bombing, though no formal charges have been filed against them at this time. This connection raises further questions about potential patterns of behavior or networks responsible for these incidents.

As details surrounding the latest bomb threats continue to emerge, the community is left grappling with uncertainty regarding the intent behind these acts. While it remains unclear whether the devices were aimed at causing mass casualties or merely meant to induce fear within the public, local law enforcement, and federal agents are working diligently to ensure the safety of residents and commuters in the area.

Authorities are urging anyone with information about the incidents to come forward and assist in the investigation.

Real_64-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on Between Two Ferns: 'I really regret doing this',"Story highlights The interview is part of the Clinton campaign's attempt to show a funnier, softer side

President Barack Obama also sat down with Zach Galifianakis to tout the Affordable Care Act

(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it.

Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video , plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself.

""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs.

Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump.

""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention.

Magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect

A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said.

""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening.

Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami.

""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer.""

The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.

Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

The defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, James Patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.

In a significant development, U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein has declined a request for the immediate arraignment of bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami on federal charges. This ruling comes amid ongoing debates regarding the proper legal protocols related to Rahami's detention and potential arraignment.

The request for an expedited court appearance was dismissed by Judge Gorenstein, who sided with federal prosecutors arguing that Rahami should not be brought into federal court until he is in federal custody. Gorenstein highlighted that there is currently no evidence indicating that Rahami has been arrested by federal authorities, complicating the bid for an immediate arraignment.

Rahami, who is hospitalized in Newark, has been the subject of considerable legal scrutiny following his alleged involvement in a bombing incident. His defense attorneys asserted that federal law enforcement agencies are indeed involved in his detention and questioning. However, Judge Gorenstein contested this assertion, noting no clear indications that federal authorities are handling his case at this time.

The magistrate's decision also included a rejection of the defense's claims that federal court regulations necessitate a prompt arraignment, even in cases where individuals have been arrested by state authorities. This ruling emphasizes the legal complexities surrounding jurisdictional issues and the rights of arrested suspects under different circumstances.

In light of these developments, Gorenstein has declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami. Furthermore, he stated that he cannot appoint defense attorneys from the Federal Defenders of New York to represent Rahami at this stage, as he is not yet in federal custody.

On the federal prosecutorial front, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has indicated that plans are in place for Rahami to be brought to New York City imminently, where he will face federal charges. This announcement sets the stage for further legal proceedings, as federal authorities prepare to address the alleged offenses against him.

As discussions continue regarding Rahami's legal status, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office has not commented on the magistrate's decision, leaving many questions unanswered about the governmental approach to this high-profile case.

Meanwhile, defense attorney James Patton has refrained from responding to inquiries regarding the magistrate's ruling, contributing to the ongoing intrigue surrounding Rahami's detention and forthcoming arraignment.

The legal proceedings against Ahmad Rahami are expected to draw significant attention, as the implications of this case resonate across various levels of law enforcement and judicial accountability. As authorities move forward, the focus now shifts to preparation for the upcoming federal charges and the judicial process that will follow.",-25.0,-28.0,471.0,-1.5625,-0.05307855626326964,470.0,-1.6470588235294117,-0.059574468085106386
Real_66-Webpage,US: ISIS did not use mustard agent in base attack,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL — OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

Real_67-Webpage,"Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say","The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.

""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.

Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.

A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.

The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.

""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

Andres Kudacki/AP Photo

Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.

He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""

James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.

""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.

""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg,"More Meghan,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997,"{""fb_title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@mkeneally"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-19"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-19 18:04:32"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race""}","- Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, and a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have heightened interest in presidential candidates' national security approaches.

In the wake of these incidents, which resulted in numerous injuries, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have issued statements reflecting their positions on the matter.

The immediate aftermath of these attacks has been marked by a noticeable impact on voter sentiment, according to John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security. Cohen asserts that the public's fear level is rising, which could favor candidates who are perceived as strong on security issues. Historically, national security has been a domain where Republican candidates have held an edge; however, the landscape appears to be shifting.

Pre-attack national polls had shown Clinton leading in public trust regarding her ability to handle terrorism. An ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated that among all adults, 50% of respondents trusted Clinton compared to 41% who favored Trump. When narrowing the focus to likely voters, the margin was tight but still in Clinton’s favor, with 48% supporting her against 45% for Trump. Similarly, a CBS/New York Times poll revealed that 49% of respondents trusted Clinton over 45% for Trump on national security issues. A Quinnipiac poll further substantiated this trend, with Clinton holding a narrow lead at 49% against Trump’s 47% in terms of keeping the country safe from terrorism.

Despite these figures, Cohen highlighted a crucial shift in how voters perceive the strength of each candidate regarding national security. This traditionally Republican stronghold now poses questions about Trump's understanding of terrorism and national security, potentially undermining his standing with voters who prioritize these issues.

In a clear response to recent events, both campaign teams have adjusted their messaging to emphasize national security. However, Cohen cautiorns that the aggressive political rhetoric could inadvertently inspire potential terrorist actions, creating a need for candidates to tread carefully in their communications.

Adding another layer to the political dynamic, James Campbell, a political science professor, posits that these terrorist events could inadvertently benefit Trump. His argument hinges on the notion that he can frame the attacks as failures of the current administration's foreign policy, thereby prompting calls for a more stringent approach to immigration standards. This strategy would align with Trump's previous advocacy for tough immigration measures, potentially bolstering his appeal among voters who prioritize perceived safety and security.

As candidates navigate this complex landscape, their positions on national security are rapidly becoming a focal point in the upcoming presidential race. The recent attacks have not only raised the stakes for all contenders but have also intensified voter scrutiny regarding their qualifications to ensure safety and security in the country. 

In conclusion, the public's heightened concern over national security in the wake of these attacks is reshaping the electoral battleground for 2024. Candidates like Clinton and Trump are under immense pressure to articulate their plans and reassure voters of their capability to protect the nation. This evolving narrative will play a crucial role in influencing voter decisions as the election approaches and could ultimately determine the trajectory of their campaigns. The emphasis on safety, security, and the effective management of terrorism will likely dominate discussions in the months to come, providing both challenges and opportunities for the candidates involved.",6.0,20.0,604.0,0.3333333333333333,0.009933774834437087,638.0,0.8695652173913043,0.03134796238244514

When is the first general election presidential debate?

The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.

Story Continued Below

What time is the debate and how long is it?

The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.

How can I watch the debate?

It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.

Who will participate in the debate?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.

Who will moderate the debate?

Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.

What is the format of the debate?

The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.

Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?

Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.

What's at stake for Hillary Clinton?

The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.

What's at stake for Donald Trump?

Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again.

What is the most watched debate in presidential history?

In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.

What's the most-watched television moment of all time?

Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.

Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.

The highly anticipated first presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle is scheduled to take place on September 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. As the nation gears up for what promises to be a pivotal moment in the campaign, the debate will kick off at 9:00 p.m. ET, lasting for a full 90 minutes without any commercial interruptions.

Broadcasting giants and digital platforms will ensure wide accessibility of the debate to the public. Major television networks will relay the event live, and viewers can also tune in online through various cable news websites and C-SPAN. The stage is set for a showdown between the two primary candidates: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and real estate mogul Donald Trump. Notably, they will be the only candidates participating, as both Jill Stein and Gary Johnson were not invited due to their failure to meet the 15% threshold in selected national polls.

The debate will be moderated by Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."" This will mark Holt’s second event as moderator in this presidential cycle, placing him in a crucial role as he guides the discourse between the candidates. The format of the debate is designed to facilitate a robust exchange of ideas, comprising six segments of 15 minutes each. Holt will initiate each segment with a question, after which both candidates will have two minutes to respond, followed by opportunities for mutual response.

Among the tentative topics slated for discussion are “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” These topics are likely to resonate with voters, given the pressing issues facing the nation and the dynamics of the current political landscape. However, it is important to note that these subjects are subject to change, particularly as current events unfold leading up to the debate.

For Hillary Clinton, the debate presents a critical opportunity to regain her polling lead and to demonstrate her extensive policy knowledge and formidable debate experience. Analysts suggest that Clinton may focus on showcasing her qualifications and her vision for America's future, as she seeks to reassure voters of her capabilities as a candidate.

On the other hand, Donald Trump approaches the debate with a different set of challenges. Critiques surrounding his policy expertise and overall demeanor have been prevalent in discussions about his candidacy. However, there is speculation that Trump's low expectations could play to his advantage. As he steps into the debate, many will be watching to see how he conducts himself and whether he can articulate his vision clearly and compellingly.

The historical context of presidential debates adds another layer of intrigue to this upcoming event. The most-watched debate in history was the 1980 face-off between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, which attracted a staggering 80.6 million viewers. While the viewership for significant events has surpassed this figure — with Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 amassing 114 million viewers, making it the most-watched television program in U.S. history — the debate is expected to draw a considerable audience.

As both candidates prepare to take the stage, there is an air of suspense surrounding the outcomes of their interactions. Engaging debates can sway undecided voters and have lasting impacts on polling figures leading up to the election. With the stakes so high, both Clinton and Trump are likely to approach the debate with strategies that reflect their respective campaigns.

The debate at Hofstra University is not merely another event in the political calendar; it stands as a defining moment for both candidates. Each will strive to connect with voters while defending their platforms and attacking their opponents. As the date approaches, pundits and citizens alike are left to speculate on how this initial meeting will influence the trajectory of the 2016 presidential race.

In a climate where public opinion is more crucial than ever, all eyes will be on the candidates as they present their cases to the American people. While political affiliations and personal opinions abound, one thing is certain: the first presidential debate has the potential to shape the dynamic of the election as both candidates vie for the trust and support of the electorate. As September 26 draws near, anticipation grows for what promises to be a memorable and consequential night in American political history.",14.0,32.0,780.0,0.3684210526315789,0.017948717948717947,798.0,1.032258064516129,0.040100250626566414

Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday in Linden, N.J. | Nicolaus Czarnecki/Boston Herald via AP U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing.

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.

However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved.

""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""

The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.

Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.

While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.

The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.

Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.

Ahmad Khan Rahami has been taken into custody after a violent shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation resulted in injuries to Rahami and two police officers, leading to serious legal ramifications for the alleged assailant. Rahami, who remains hospitalized in Newark, faces significant charges including five counts of attempted murder stemming from the incident.

As the legal proceedings begin, defense attorneys for Rahami are pushing for an immediate arraignment on federal charges and have made formal requests to ensure that Rahami is informed of his legal rights. They argue that prompt action is necessary to protect his interests following his arrest.

However, federal prosecutors counter this assertion, stating that there is no legal obligation to arraign Rahami since he is currently in state custody. This underscores the complexity of his legal situation as he navigates both state and federal jurisdictions. The debate over his rights has drawn attention, with the U.S. Attorney's office affirming that Rahami presently has no rights under the federal system, adding another layer of contention to the ongoing proceedings.

The legal conundrum is further complicated by claims from Rahami’s defense team, who contend that he has been without legal counsel since his arrest. There are also calls for clarity on his Miranda rights status, which poses significant implications for the case. The defense is advocating for adequate representation to ensure that Rahami's legal rights are upheld during this tumultuous time.

In the wake of these developments, federal prosecutors have expressed that the request by the Federal Defenders office in New York to be appointed on Rahami's behalf is premature. The federal magistrate judge, Gabriel Gorenstein, has yet to take immediate action on the defense's requests, leaving many questions unanswered as the situation unfolds.

As the narrative continues to evolve, it has been reported by lawmakers that Rahami has not been cooperating with investigators. This lack of cooperation may hinder the progress of the investigation and further complicate the legal strategy of his defense team. The initial court appearance for Rahami is scheduled for September 28. At this hearing, additional details regarding his custody status and charges are likely to emerge.

Rahami’s bail has been set at an extraordinary $5.2 million, reflecting the serious nature of the charges against him and the public safety concerns stemming from the shootout. As the courts prepare to address these issues, both sides of the legal spectrum are gearing up for what promises to be a protracted legal battle.

The situation remains fluid, with both state and federal authorities involved in the case. As Rahami’s case progresses through the courts, it serves as a stark reminder of the complexities associated with criminal justice, particularly when individuals face charges that cross multiple jurisdictions. The intersection of state and federal law will continue to be scrutinized in the weeks leading up to the scheduled court appearance, and the implications for Rahami could be significant.

Overall, the Rahami case is a developing story that illustrates the challenges of the legal system and the importance of due process. As authorities work to address the various aspects of his case, the community is left waiting for answers and outcomes that will undoubtedly have lasting repercussions. The events surrounding this incident have captured widespread attention, prompting discussions about accountability and justice in the realm of criminal law.",-21.0,-1.0,597.0,-1.05,-0.035175879396984924,629.0,-0.04,-0.001589825119236884
Real_7-Webpage,Donald Trump's rise puts Ted Cruz in a bind,"Story highlights Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump earlier this year, but is under pressure to change his mind now

Cruz could face a primary challenge in 2018 from a fellow Republican

Washington (CNN) Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said.

JUST WATCHED Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife 01:51

On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them.""

Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

Rep. Trent Franks has joined the chorus urging Cruz to reconsider, emphasizing that a Trump endorsement is crucial in the battle against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, whom he claims could jeopardize the Constitution. However, Cruz's decision is complicated by advice from some of his supporters, who caution that backing Trump might alienate parts of his own base, many of whom have expressed strong disapproval of the businessman’s candidacy.

Iowa radio host Steve Deace, a former Cruz supporter, argues that endorsing Trump would contradict Cruz's established principles, further complicating the senator's stance as Election Day approaches. With less than two months remaining until voters head to the polls, Trump’s rising poll numbers place additional pressure on Cruz to publicly support the GOP nominee.

Trump's supporters are eager to showcase momentum in his campaign and may seek to shift blame onto Cruz should the election result in a narrow loss for the Republican Party. As the political landscape shifts and time dwindles, Cruz finds himself at a crossroads, weighing the implications of his endorsement against the potential fallout within his political sphere. The coming days will be critical as Cruz navigates this complex political terrain and considers the future of his party's unity heading into a contentious election season.",10.0,5.0,294.0,1.1111111111111112,0.034013605442176874,287.0,0.5555555555555556,0.017421602787456445

Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks.

The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe.

“Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.”

Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.”

“They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”

Former President Donald Trump has called for a significant change in U.S. policy regarding the Islamic State, urging a departure from strategies previously employed by former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. His remarks come in the wake of alarming incidents of terrorism, including recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing incident in Minnesota.

In a pointed critique on Twitter, Trump lambasted Clinton for her perceived ineffectiveness against ISIS, suggesting that her approach has left the U.S. vulnerable to terrorist threats. He accused both Clinton and Obama of deliberately avoiding the term ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" claiming that this avoidance has inadvertently bolstered terrorist groups’ resolve and capabilities.

Trump did not hold back in his assessment, arguing that Clinton's statements are mere attempts to deflect from her past weaknesses during her tenure as Secretary of State. He further asserted that terrorists are hoping for a Clinton presidency, believing that her election could enable the continuation of their violent agenda.

In addressing the broader narrative surrounding the fight against ISIS, Trump condemned the current administration's focus on what he termed ""narratives,"" stating that such a stance is inadequate against the real and present danger posed by terrorists. He firmly emphasized the seriousness of the threat these groups pose to American values and way of life, promising to take decisive action to end the violence.

Trump's renewed focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy comes at a critical juncture, as the nation grapples with heightened fears of terrorism amid recent attacks. His comments signal a call for a reassessment of existing strategies to ensure the safety and security of Americans.",-41.0,-27.0,328.0,-5.125,-0.125,322.0,-2.7,-0.08385093167701864
Real_71-Webpage,Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible',"Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.

Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.

Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""

On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""

""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.

A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.

""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.

Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.

Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.

This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.

Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.

Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.

Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.

On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.

Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""

Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.

""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.

Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.

Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.

All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.

On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.

""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.

A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.

Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""

Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.

Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.

Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.

In a riveting day of testimony in federal court, details emerged regarding a scheme orchestrated by former executives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, along with key aides to former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, aimed at creating significant traffic disruptions stemming from the controversial lane closures on the George Washington Bridge in September 2013.

David Wildstein, a former director at the Port Authority, took the stand and provided critical insights into the motivations behind the efforts to close access lanes leading into Fort Lee, New Jersey. According to Wildstein, the plan was partly ignited by frustrations articulated by Bridget Kelly, who was at the time Christie’s deputy chief of staff. Wildstein testified that Kelly expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of endorsement from Fort Lee's Democratic Mayor, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection bid. This sentiment, he asserted, contributed to the decision to not only close lanes but to use the closures as a tool to exert political pressure on the mayor.

Wildstein, who plead guilty to charges of conspiracy and civil rights violations, revealed that he was in frequent communication with Kelly and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority. These conversations included discussions about the strategic implementation of the lane closures, with a clear agreement to provide no prior notice to either Fort Lee officials or residents. This deliberate withholding of information was detailed as a part of a ""radio silence"" policy wherein all inquiries concerning the lane closures were to be directed to Baroni's office, with no responses forthcoming.

The testimony further delineated that the intent behind the lane closures was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee,"" especially as the closures were timed to coincide with the opening of schools on September 9, 2013. Initially, Wildstein had planned to close all three Fort Lee access lanes; however, after consulting with engineers regarding safety concerns, he adjusted the plan to only shut down two lanes.

On September 6, just days before the closures were set to commence, Wildstein informed the Port Authority staff of the impending lane reductions. This notification came despite repeated warnings from staff about potential traffic chaos resulting from the closures. Wildstein misrepresented the nature of the lane closures, misleading staff into believing that these actions were part of a legitimate traffic study.

As the lane closures went into effect, the fallout was immediate. Wildstein testified that he closely monitored the ensuing traffic gridlock, documenting the significant buildup. He conveyed this information to Kelly, with whom he had established a working relationship characterized by mutual support for the closures. Wildstein recounted that Kelly reacted with pleasure to the reports on traffic congestion, indicating a level of tacit approval for the disruptive strategy.

Throughout the duration of the closures, officials from Fort Lee, including Mayor Sokolich, made numerous attempts to reach out to both Baroni and Wildstein. However, these efforts were met with silence, as the previously established policy of ""radio silence"" remained in effect. The positioning taken by Wildstein suggested that Baroni's primary role was to represent the interests of Governor Christie, distinctly prioritizing the governor's needs above those of constituents and local leaders.

The fallout from the lane closures has not only put former aides and executives under scrutiny but has laid the groundwork for significant legal consequences. Both Kelly and Baroni now face serious charges, including conspiracy and fraud, as they prepare to mount defenses in connection to the scandal that has resonated throughout New Jersey and beyond.

As the trial continues, the implications of Wildstein's testimony prompt sustained scrutiny on the actions and decisions made by officials at the highest levels of state government and their potential misuse of power. The court proceedings are expected to provide further insights into the extent of the strategy behind the lane closures and the motivations guiding those who had the authority to create such monumental disruptions.

The activities surrounding the closures have raised critical questions about political accountability and the ethical boundaries of political maneuvering. With the trial unfolding, both public interest and concern continue to mount regarding the broader ramifications of these actions and the governance of public agencies. As the case develops, it promises to reveal further layers of intricacy and accountability in modern political strategies. 

In conclusion, the testimony from David Wildstein not only sheds light on the sinister motives behind the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge but serves as a reminder of the potential for political power to be wielded in a manner that can drastically affect the lives of everyday citizens. The pursuit of accountability remains at the forefront, as all eyes are now focused on how the judicial process will unfold in the coming proceedings.",9.0,-14.0,1009.0,0.225,0.008919722497522299,888.0,-0.4827586206896552,-0.015765765765765764

It's living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state

(CNN) Florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the November election.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched.

The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.

""So if I had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin,"" says USF Tampa political scientist Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor at the University of South Florida. ""We're to the point where anything is possible. This is just one of those kind of elections.""

All eyes are on central Florida's I-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. The area stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics.

Real_74-Webpage,HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night’s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Here’s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday’s debate? — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet’s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

There’s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night’s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins aren’t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

@HuffingtonPost someone’s upset that #Trumpwins — Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? — Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ? pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y — Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn’t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate – except for the little watched @CNN poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, “Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN’s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.” They actually looks like they’re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

In the wake of the recent debate, public opinion appears sharply divided over who emerged victorious, with differing polling methodologies leading to conflicting narratives. A CNN/ORC poll revealed that 62% of respondents believed Hillary Clinton was the clear winner of the debate, providing a significant boost to her campaign narrative. Conversely, a series of online polls indicated that Donald Trump was the preferred choice among respondents, with many showing him winning by a notable margin.

However, experts, including those from the Huffington Post, have raised concerns regarding the reliability of these online polls. Their critique centered on the ease with which these polls can be manipulated, casting doubt on the authenticity of the results. This contrasted starkly with CNN's polling methodology, which involved contacting real individuals to gather their opinions, thereby providing a more structured and potentially reliable analysis.

In particular, allegations emerged suggesting that Trump supporters were actively trying to sway online polls in his favor through platforms such as 4chan and Reddit. These supporters reportedly expressed their frustration towards the Huffington Post for questioning the validity of their online polling outcomes, perceiving the criticism as an affront to their efforts.

Trump himself has weighed in on this ongoing debate about the polls, claiming to have won all polls except for the CNN one, which he dubbed less credible than those favoring him. He pointed to a growing trend on social media, noting the hashtag #TrumpWon parading across Twitter after the debate, further underlining his supporters' belief that he performed better than the official CNN analysis suggests.

Despite the fervor from Trump's camp over online sentiment, he also referenced a particular story that posited many snap polls conducted after the debate favored him, aiming to bolster his claim of overall victory. This assertion, however, sits at odds with the CNN/ORC findings that encapsulate a larger representative sample.

As the dust settles on the debate and both sides of the political spectrum vie for narrative control, the discrepancies between structured polling and informal online measures highlight a broader issue in the assessment of public opinion. Ultimately, based on the data provided by reputable polling organizations like CNN, it is evident that Hillary Clinton presently stands out as the clear winner of the recent debate. This outcome raises critical questions about the influence of perceived online victories against statistically grounded polling results, and how those differing narratives shape the ongoing political landscape. 

As we continue to sift through the aftermath of the debate, both candidates will likely seek to leverage their respective poll results in the days to come, setting the stage for new discussions about credibility, representation, and what it truly means to win in the age of digital media.",35.0,39.0,556.0,1.75,0.06294964028776978,513.0,2.4375,0.07602339181286549

He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson

(CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose.

""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week.

Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history.

""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. It may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. That's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history.""

Real_76-Webpage,Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s Vice President Joe Biden.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday’s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

“This is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?”

Adding:

“Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

“He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘You’re fired.’ They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

“He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

“If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord… What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.”

And it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Watch Biden lay into Trump here:

PHILADELPHIA – Vice President Joe Biden made a notable campaign appearance in Philadelphia, lending his voice to support Hillary Clinton as she vies for the presidency. During his remarks, Biden forcefully criticized Donald Trump’s recent comments made during a televised debate that revolved around the housing market's collapse and its broader implications for American citizens.

Biden launched a sharp critique of Trump’s assertion that he benefited from the failure of the housing market. ""Can you believe it? He's proud of it,"" Biden declared. The Vice President expressed disbelief at the idea that anyone could take pride in profiting from the suffering of countless families and communities that were devastated by the housing crisis. This sentiment struck a chord with the audience, many of whom were deeply affected by the downturn in the economy.

In his address, Biden further emphasized the importance of moral values in leadership, noting that every president he has served alongside upheld a commitment to American values and basic rights. He contrasted this with his assessment of Trump, claiming that the real estate mogul lacks the fundamental sensibilities and values that are typically shared among politicians, regardless of their party affiliation. “Leadership is about more than just power; it’s about a moral compass,” Biden stated, underscoring the ethical considerations central to American governance.

A significant point of Biden's remarks was directed at Trump’s blatant pride in not paying taxes. ""How can you be proud of that?"" Biden asked, voicing anger over what he described as a manifest unfairness toward ordinary Americans who diligently contribute to the nation's tax system. This statement resonated with voters who feel the pinch of economic inequality.

Biden didn’t shy away from expressing his frustration over Trump’s rhetoric, which he characterized as cynical and dismissive of the struggles faced by the working class. “We need a leader who understands the plight of the everyday American,” he asserted, calling attention to the contrasting visions offered by the two candidates in the election. 

In reinforcing his support for Clinton, Biden proclaimed that the choice in this election is unmistakably clear. He made a strong case for Clinton as the candidate who stands for the values and dignity of the people, positioning her as the more suitable choice to lead the nation. Through his passionate delivery, Biden not only endorsed Clinton but also distinguished her candidacy from the perceived shortcomings of Trump.

This latest appearance in Philadelphia is part of a broader effort by the Clinton campaign to rally support and connect with voters in key battleground states.

At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday.

The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.

Story Continued Below

The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.

The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.

""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""

In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.

“This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

In a shocking revelation, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) inspector general has reported that 858 individuals who were ordered for deportation erroneously received U.S. citizenship. The report underscores significant systemic flaws within the digital fingerprint repository of the DHS and the FBI, marking a critical area of concern for immigration enforcement agencies.

The crux of the issue lies in the incomplete records within these repositories, which have given rise to potential citizenship errors. Many fingerprint records, particularly those filed before 2008, were not digitized adequately. This lack of digitization has hindered the sharing of crucial immigration enforcement fingerprints with the FBI, creating a gap in the verification process that should ideally prevent ineligible individuals from gaining citizenship.

While the inspector general's report asserts that the individuals granted citizenship were ""potentially"" ineligible, it also clarifies that this does not automatically imply that all of them were granted citizenship incorrectly. However, the implications of the findings are serious enough to warrant scrutiny and corrective measures from the DHS.

In response to the alarming findings, the DHS is actively taking steps to address the issues related to the incomplete fingerprint records. It's important to note that not all applicants with incomplete records were granted citizenship erroneously. Moreover, the situation has led to some cases being canceled—those that were found to have been denied previously. Several ongoing cases are currently under investigation as well, potentially leading to denaturalization proceedings.

Among the troubling incidents highlighted in the report were three deported individuals who had been granted citizenship. These individuals later received clearance for secure employment at airports but subsequently had their security credentials revoked following the discovery of the discrepancies surrounding their citizenship status. This troubling revelation underscores the potential security risks posed by inadequate vetting processes.

Inspector General John Roth emphasized that these circumstances allowed for the possibility of individuals fraudulently obtaining citizenship, raising essential questions about the effectiveness of current vetting and verification systems. The report highlights a pressing need for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to have comprehensive access to fingerprint records. This access is vital to prevent instances of fraud and to ensure that application reviews are thorough and thoroughgoing, especially given the sensitive nature of the citizenship process.

The findings of the inspector general’s report have reignited discussions surrounding the vetting of immigrants, which has been a focal point in political discourse, particularly among Republicans. Donald Trump, a notable candidate, has previously emphasized the importance of such vetting processes, even suggesting a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. The current revelations may intensify calls for reforms to immigration policies and the procedures used to evaluate applicants.

As the DHS grapples with the challenges posed by these findings, the broader implications for the immigration system remain evident. The need for improved record-keeping, digitization, and inter-agency sharing is immediate and pressing. In the wake of these reports, stakeholders across the political and administrative spectrum will be watching closely to see how the DHS implements changes to strengthen the integrity of the citizenship application process.

In conclusion, the inspector general's report serves as a critical reminder of the vulnerabilities within the immigration system, highlighting the paramount importance of vigilance in ensuring that U.S. citizenship is granted only to those who meet all legal requirements. The path forward must involve both rectifying past errors and fortifying systems to prevent future occurrences.",-16.0,-2.0,559.0,-1.0,-0.028622540250447227,636.0,-0.07692307692307693,-0.0031446540880503146
Real_78-Webpage,Insiders: The heat is on Hillary,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.

Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.

Story Continued Below

That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.

“She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,” said a Nevada Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.”

“The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,” a New Hampshire Democrat added. “Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.”

One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.

“Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the Ohio Democrat. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.”

Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.

“Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an Ohio Republican. “Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.”

“She has to stop [Trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a Virginia Republican. “All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.”

Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans — most pointed to the GOP nominee’s volatile personality.

“Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,” said a Michigan Republican. “The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.”

“The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?” added a Michigan Democrat. “Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?”

Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:

Most insiders expect Clinton to “win” the debate.

Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

“Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,” said an Iowa Republican.

“[Clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a New Hampshire Democrat.

But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.

“The press wants Trump to win,” said a Florida Democrat. “Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.”

Some Republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction.

“The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,” a Virginia Republican said. “But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.”

Insiders think the debate will matter.

Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.

Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle.

“Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a Michigan Democrat predicted. “The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.”

The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact.

“Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.”

But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump’s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.

“If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an Iowa Republican. “If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.”

Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.

“We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,” an Iowa Republican said. “Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.”

Added a Florida Democrat: “Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.”

As the upcoming debate looms, Hillary Clinton faces intensified scrutiny and expectations to deliver a stellar performance against her opponent, Donald Trump. With insiders from both Democratic and Republican camps acknowledging that Clinton has lost her once-favorable lead, the stakes have never been higher for the former Secretary of State. 

According to a recent survey, a significant portion of the electorate—69% of Democrats and an even higher 74% of Republicans—believe that Clinton is under more pressure than Trump as the candidates prepare for their face-off. These figures reflect a growing consensus that the debate is not merely a formality but a critical juncture that could determine the trajectory of the race.

### The Challenge of Expectations

Some Democrats have voiced concerns regarding the expectations set for Trump, suggesting that they are alarmingly low given his lack of political experience. This critique points to a broader issue of media framing and public perception that may skew the performance evaluations of both candidates. A Nevada Democrat highlighted the worrying trend that the media might favor Trump simply for managing to avoid major blunders during the debate.

Compounding these concerns is the perception of a double standard operating against Clinton. An Ohio Democrat noted that Clinton, as the first female major-party nominee, faces a unique type of scrutiny that Trump does not. The implications of this double standard carry weight as Clinton prepares to confront not just Trump, but also historical biases that may color the debate's narrative.

### Scrutiny and Stakes

Republicans are not without their own observations regarding the state of the race. They've pointed out that Clinton is facing intensified scrutiny, particularly in light of tightening polls that favor Trump in crucial battleground states. As the race heats up, it becomes increasingly clear that Clinton requires a strong performance not only to reverse Trump's current momentum but also to quell lingering concerns about her health.

Conversely, the pressure isn’t solely on Clinton. Insiders suggest that Trump will also be working under significant pressure to maintain his composure and demonstrate a presidential demeanor. The weight of expectations rests heavily on both candidates as they understand that their performances could have lasting implications on their campaigns.

### Predictions on Debate Outcomes

Despite the pressures, most insiders are leaning towards a Clinton victory in the debate. A striking 76% of Democratic insiders believe that she will win, while a notable 59% of Republican insiders share a similar sentiment. While many speculate that Clinton will eclipse Trump in terms of performance, apprehension persists among some Democrats regarding possible media bias that could favor Trump regardless of his actual delivery.

A Democrat from Florida articulated this skepticism, suggesting that the media's treatment of Clinton might create a skewed perception of who truly won the debate. Interestingly, Republicans have also expressed concerns about media bias, anticipating that Clinton will receive favorable coverage that could inflate her perceived success.

The expectation that the debate will significantly impact the race is shared widely. A significant majority of insiders believe the event could realign momentum, with 66% of Democratic insiders suggesting that Clinton would benefit from the debate, while 52% of Republicans feel that Trump will gain from it. These insights indicate that while the debate might serve as a platform for both candidates, differing expectations could lead to contrasting narrative outcomes.

### Polarization and Voter Sentiment

It’s essential to note that while there is an overwhelming belief that debate performances can sway voters, some insiders harbor doubts. They contend that due to increasing partisan polarization, even a compelling debate could lead to only temporary shifts in voter sentiment. Many viewers may remain entrenched in their positions, making it challenging for either candidate to effect meaningful change.

As the countdown to the debate continues, both candidates find themselves at a pivotal moment that could either solidify their respective bases or shift the dynamics leading up to the election. Therefore, insiders perceive the upcoming debate not just as another campaign event but as a crucial opportunity for both Clinton and Trump to assert their narratives and solidify their standing with undecided voters.

In a high-stakes political environment, where every word and gesture can be scrutinized, the performances of Clinton and Trump in the debate will likely play a pivotal role in shaping opinions and potentially influencing the final outcomes of their campaigns.",43.0,23.0,2576.0,0.8431372549019608,0.016692546583850932,815.0,0.7666666666666667,0.02822085889570552
Real_79-Webpage,Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

In recent days, Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric Trump have drawn considerable attention on social media, resulting in a mix of humor and criticism from the public. Donald Trump Jr. has faced backlash for what many perceive as a lack of intelligence in his online commentary. Meanwhile, Eric Trump has also been mocked, particularly for his pride in being featured in a crossword puzzle. This has led to an ongoing discourse about the Trump brothers’ contributions to the realm of social media, often deemed humorous by some while sparking serious debates among others.

One of the current trending topics that has continued to generate heated discussions is Colin Kaepernick’s protest during the National Anthem. The former NFL quarterback initially began his protest to highlight issues surrounding racial injustice and police brutality, specifically in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. This act, however, has caused a division among audiences, especially as an increasing number of athletes continue to kneel during the National Anthem to showcase their support for these pressing social issues. While many regard this form of protest as a powerful display of self-expression, they simultaneously face significant backlash from conservative groups.

Donald Trump Jr. has been vocal in his criticism, accusing Kaepernick and other athletes of disrespecting the military and veterans through their protests. This accusation has raised questions about the intersection of patriotism and protest, particularly in the context of the First Amendment, which protects individuals’ rights to express their beliefs, even in controversial manners. 

On the other side of the spectrum, supporters of Kaepernick and the protesting athletes argue that their right to self-expression should be protected, invoking the First Amendment as a defense against the rising tide of conservative criticism. This ideological clash has led to calls from some conservatives for penalties against these athletes, suggesting that those who kneel should face not only social backlash but even potential legal ramifications. This stance has ignited further debate regarding the balance between patriotism and the right to dissent in a democratic society.

Conservatives traditionally prioritize the Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms, but increasingly, some are seeking to impose restrictions on the exercise of free speech related to acts of protest. This contradiction is notable; while advocating for the right to carry firearms, the same groups sometimes demand penalties for those who choose to kneel during the National Anthem – a behavior fundamentally rooted in personal belief and expression.

A thoughtful analysis highlights that the Supreme Court has routinely sided with free speech protections, often ruling against conservative demands for compulsory expressions of patriotism. This creates an intriguing scenario where the enforcement of mandatory patriotism, often championed by critics of Kaepernick, stands in contrast to established legal principles.

Notably, criticism has emerged surrounding the idea of mandatory patriotism itself, particularly in relation to actions such as singing the National Anthem. The notion that patriotism can be enforced through coercion undermines the very principles that the anthem is meant to celebrate, leading to questions about the authenticity of such expressions. The debate about whether athletes should be compelled to participate in such displays of allegiance continues to spark discussions about the core values celebrated in the United States.

As the discussions evolve, the Trump brothers’ humorous social media presence juxtaposed against the intense social issue surrounding Kaepernick’s protest reveals the multifaceted nature of American discourse, where humor, patriotism, and the right to self-expression converge in complex ways. The implications of these conversations stretch far beyond the social media platforms where they originate, calling into question the fabric of freedom in a society that values both expression and patriotism.",-17.0,-3.0,592.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.028716216216216218,685.0,-0.13636363636363635,-0.004379562043795621
Real_8-Webpage,More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump! – Eagle Rising,"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.

The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category.

Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.

Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.

Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.

Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”. Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said.

Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”

In the world of politics, perceptions can shift dramatically in the blink of an eye. Last week’s article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” elicited mixed reactions, particularly from liberals and self-described “Never Trumpers,” who found it irritating. However, despite this backlash, the numbers tell a revealing story: recent polls indicate a significant uptick in support for former President Donald Trump, suggesting a renewed vigor in his campaign as he gears up for the upcoming electoral battle.

Recent polling data shines a spotlight on Trump’s rising popularity among voters. A Fox News poll conducted from September 11 to 14 shows Trump commanding a narrow lead over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with 46% of respondents favoring him compared to Clinton’s 45%. Similarly, the LA Times/USC poll from September 9 to 15 shows Trump pulling ahead with 47% to Clinton's 41%, indicating a more pronounced gap. Notably, a Suffolk University poll taken from September 12 to 14 also reflects this trend, with Trump at 42% and Clinton trailing at 39%. Furthermore, a CNN/ORC poll from September 7 to 12 illustrates Trump’s ongoing strength in Florida, where he maintains a 4-point lead. 

These numbers are particularly critical as they suggest that gaps in key battleground states are narrowing, with several states moving towards “toss up” status. This shift indicates that Trump’s base may be expanding, and the dynamics of the race could be more competitive than initially anticipated. 

Amid these rising numbers, Trump also unveiled a key new policy initiative: a childcare plan he introduced in Aston, Pennsylvania. The proposal, heavily promoted by his daughter Ivanka Trump, seeks to address the pressing issues surrounding childcare and parental leave. It includes several significant provisions that aim to appeal to a wide range of families, especially working mothers and lower-income households. Among the main features is a proposal for six weeks of paid maternity leave for mothers lacking employer benefits, which would be funded through adjustments to unemployment insurance. 

Moreover, the plan outlines the implementation of childcare rebates for lower-income families, tied to the Earned Income Tax Credit, amounting to as much as $1,200 per year. Trump’s proposal would also allow full childcare expense tax deductions for middle-class families, providing them with much-needed financial relief. Additionally, it introduces Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs), where tax-free contributions and matches would be available specifically for low-income families. To further ease the burden on families, tax deductions for stay-at-home parents are included to counterbalance the existing tax penalties associated with caregiving responsibilities.

Continuing his proactive approach, Trump took to the stage at the Economic Club of New York, where he rolled out more of his policy proposals and addressed the economic challenges facing the nation. The speech highlighted his commitment to revitalizing the economy and fostering job creation, with Trump showcasing his vision for the American workforce.

Beyond policy proposals, Trump has also been strategically promoting his image and contrasting his health with that of Hillary Clinton. His appearance on The Dr. Oz Show was particularly notable, where he shared his medical results in a bid to dispel concerns that have been circulated regarding Clinton's health. This attempt to project vigor aims to bolster his standing as a capable leader ready to tackle the demands of the presidency.

In a move to connect with younger audiences, Trump also appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. During this light-hearted segment, he allowed Fallon to humorously mess up his hair, a display of self-deprecation that resonated well with viewers. This interaction not only humanizes Trump but also illustrates his willingness to engage with a demographic that may not typically align with him.

Further amplifying his public presence, Trump recently celebrated the opening of his new hotel in Washington, D.C. This event was underscored by endorsements from military officials and Medal of Honor recipients, signaling strong support from significant figures within the veteran community. During this celebration, he also confronted lingering controversies, specifically addressing the “birther issue,” a topic that has dogged him since his initial foray into politics.

As the week concluded, many observers noted that Trump has crafted yet another chapter of what he characterized as an “amazing week.” With his polling numbers surging, strategic policy proposals aimed at addressing family needs, and an active effort to engage voters across the political spectrum, it is evident that Trump is intent on capturing momentum in the race as he seeks to reclaim the presidency.

In summary, Trump’s week was marked by a combination of polling gains, substantial policy proposals, and strategic outreach initiatives. As he continues to navigate the political landscape, the implications of his recent developments could significantly impact the dynamics of the electoral campaign to come. Whether his efforts will translate into lasting support and tangible success at the ballot box remains to be seen, but the increasing signals point to an invigorated candidacy moving forward.",59.0,60.0,1240.0,1.2291666666666667,0.04758064516129032,953.0,1.8181818181818181,0.06295907660020986
Real_80-Webpage,Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground,"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.

Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.

He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.

Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.

Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.

Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.

These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.

Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.

""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.

Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.

Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump.

""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.

Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.

Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""

The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.

Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.

TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.

This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.

""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""

Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""

Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""

""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""

This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.

Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.

According to TVNewser, Wednesday's town hall will focus on ""issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this election cycle.""

According to Nielsen data, only 1.5% of Hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are African American. Overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of Fox News viewers are African American.",http://cnn.it/2dcjQUU,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg,Brian Stelter,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150529102155-anheuser-busch-drinking-water-124x70.jpg,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/authors/byline-icon/brian-stelter.png,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/9.0/sections/media/cnnmedia_color.svg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170828124254-hurricane-harvey-damage-124x70.jpg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160531165528-donald-trump-media-1024x576.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif,https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=731697573629176&ev=PageView&noscript=1,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/logos/cnn-logo.png,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170828120549-whole-foods-price-drop-bananas-124x70.jpg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/sections/media/reliable-sources-cnnmoney.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/logos/money-logo.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif",http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html,"{""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Fox News, media"", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNNMoney"", ""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee."", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""url"": ""http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html"", ""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""media"", ""author"": ""Brian Stelter"", ""vr"": {""category"": ""media"", ""type"": ""Article""}, ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19T06:44:21"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Fox News, media"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 521848191196480}, ""date"": ""2016-09-19 06:44:21"", ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee."", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""url"": ""http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html"", ""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-540x304.jpg"", ""site"": ""@CNNMoney"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""viewport"": ""width=1140"", ""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee.""}","- Donald Trump's media strategy has shifted to primarily engage with Fox News while avoiding major networks and news organizations.

In a notable shift in media strategy, Donald Trump has turned his focus almost exclusively to Fox News, strategically avoiding major news networks and traditional journalism platforms. This approach appears aimed at consolidating support from his base while minimizing the likelihood of encountering probing questions from journalists.

Trump's recent engagement with Fox has included calls into the popular morning show, ""Fox & Friends,"" alongside scheduled appearances on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" and a much-anticipated town hall event with Sean Hannity. The president's decision to heavily feature on a network known for its solid viewership among conservatives may serve to rally his supporters as he reinforces his message without the interference of potentially challenging questions that might arise in broader media contexts.

This shift has not gone unnoticed by the journalism community. Many reporters have expressed frustration at Trump’s limited interactions with mainstream media, citing over 50 days since his last official press conference. While Trump’s surrogates assert that he is more accessible than former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the reality paints a contrasting picture. Clinton has recently held several press conferences, engaging with a range of media outlets, while Trump has not hosted a press conference since July, raising concerns about accountability and press access.

Critics of Trump’s media approach argue that by choosing to appear predominantly on Fox News, he not only isolates himself from the press but also diminishes the rigor of public discourse. His recent television appearances did not take place in traditional journalistic contexts; instead, they were carefully curated engagements designed to suit his messaging style. Notably, interviews with prominent newspapers like The Washington Post and The New York Times have become uncommon for Trump, further isolating him from questioning that could challenge his narrative.

Supporters of Trump may contend that this strategy is wise, as it offers a means of evading journalists who may present unfavorable or controlling questioning aimed at undermining his presidency. However, this tactic is not without consequences. Critics highlight that as Trump leverages his relationship with Fox News to control the narrative, he also risks alienating broader audiences who turn to diverse media sources for news and information.

Upcoming programming, notably a town hall focused on issues pertinent to African Americans, reflects Trump's ongoing attempts to engage with specific voter demographics. However, analysts question the efficacy of this strategy, considering the historically low viewership of Fox News among African American audiences. This juxtaposition could signal a disconnect between Trump's outreach efforts and the targeted community's media consumption habits.

As the president continues this trajectory, it raises questions about the implications for media transparency, voters' access to information, and the overall health of democratic dialogue in the political arena. While Trump's supporters may appreciate his focus on a friendly media environment, the long-term effects of such exclusivity on public trust in journalism and on the electorate's understanding of critical issues remain to be seen. 

In navigating these dynamics, Trump’s media strategy not only shapes his public persona but also delineates the boundaries of political discourse in the current landscape, influencing how voters engage with the news and with their leaders. The choices made during this election cycle—how candidates interact with the media and their audiences—will undoubtedly set precedents for future political communications and media relationships, prompting ongoing debate about the role of journalism in democracy. 

As Trump prepares for future appearances, the continuing dialogue surrounding his media strategy promises to remain a focal point for both supporters and dissenters alike. The upcoming town hall, alongside other engagements, will likely be scrutinized for its content and delivery, as both Trump and his critics aim to navigate the evolving terrain of media engagement in a politically charged environment. 

In a world of rapidly changing media landscapes, Trump’s tactics reflect broader trends in how politicians connect with constituents. By emphasizing an alliance with Fox News, he illustrates the power of targeted media environments in shaping electoral outcomes. Whether this approach solidifies support or breeds further division among voters remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: such a deliberate media strategy will continue to influence the narrative as the election draws closer.",15.0,18.0,918.0,0.35714285714285715,0.016339869281045753,792.0,0.6923076923076923,0.022727272727272728

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.""

Pence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.

Former Vice President Mike Pence appeared on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour"" to discuss recent allegations regarding a Washington Post report about the Trump Foundation. The report claims that Donald Trump utilized $258,000 from his charitable organization to resolve legal issues, a serious allegation that has drawn significant attention.

During the interview, Pence backed the Trump campaign's assertion of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" within the Post's reporting, asserting that the foundation has been subjected to ""factual errors"" in this article and previous pieces. He maintained that the Trump Foundation would address these issues, assuring viewers that it is committed to demonstrating its legal compliance.

When pressed by host Brian Williams for specific examples of the alleged inaccuracies, Pence refrained from providing any details, opting instead to comment on what he deemed a ""larger issue"" related to the Clinton Foundation. This shift in focus suggests an attempt to redirect the narrative towards criticisms of the opposing party’s charitable organization.

While Pence acknowledged the critical role of a free and independent press, he stressed that the Trump Foundation would continue to respond to queries and clarify any misconceptions surrounding its operations. This remark underscores the ongoing discourse regarding charitable foundations and their transparency, particularly amid political scrutiny.

The conversation reflects the heightened tensions surrounding political campaigns and the media's role in shaping public perception. As the investigation into the Trump Foundation continues, Pence’s comments highlight the former administration's ongoing defense against allegations it deems unfounded.",1.0,4.0,308.0,0.09090909090909091,0.003246753246753247,291.0,0.4,0.013745704467353952
Real_82-Webpage,Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.

The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

New Jersey State Police

A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.

Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.

One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.

Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

New Jersey State Police

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.

""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""

Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.

Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

New Jersey State Police

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.

Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.

Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.

A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.

In a dramatic turn of events, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, was apprehended by police in Linden, New Jersey, following his suspected involvement in a series of explosive device incidents in New York City and New Jersey. The capture has raised questions about Rahami's background and connections, as investigators work diligently to understand the motives and circumstances surrounding his actions.

Rahami was born in Afghanistan in 1988 and is part of a sizable family, reportedly consisting of seven siblings. His family emigrated to the United States in 1995, seeking a new life. Growing up in the United States, he attended Edison High School in New Jersey, where former classmates remembered him as a quiet and somewhat normal individual with a good sense of humor.

Rahami's life took a significant turn when he became a father to a child with his high school girlfriend. Following his high school graduation, he pursued an associate's degree in criminal justice at Middlesex County College from 2010 to 2012 but did not complete his studies.

The Rahami family operated a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Ahmad was known to work. Local patrons recalled him as friendly, further depicting a contrasting image to the serious charges he now faces. However, the family has not been without controversy; they previously faced legal conflicts with local police, suing officers for alleged harassment. That lawsuit was dismissed in 2012.

Investigators are closely examining Rahami's travel history, which includes a nearly year-long trip to Quetta, Pakistan, from April 2013 to March 2014. During this time, he reportedly visited family and made claims regarding Afghan refugee ties. This overseas connection is a focal point of the investigation as authorities seek to uncover any networks or influences that may relate to his actions.

Rahami’s legal troubles appear to have begun before the recent incidents; he was arrested in August 2014 for allegedly stabbing someone, but the case did not progress to an indictment. The recent events escalated dramatically when Rahami engaged in a shootout with police during his capture, resulting in him being shot once. Since then, Rahami has remained uncooperative with investigators, refusing to divulge his name.

As a result of his actions, Rahami now faces multiple serious charges, including five counts of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes. A bail amount has been set at $5.2 million, further reflecting the severity of the charges against him.

The implications of Rahami's capture extend beyond local concerns; international dimensions are beginning to emerge. The Afghan government has expressed its willingness to assist U.S. authorities in gathering information about Rahami. This development indicates that the investigation could potentially touch on international aspects, as authorities seek to ascertain the extent of Rahami's connections and influences.

In the wake of these events, the community and authorities are grappling with the reality of the situation. The juxtaposition of Rahami's past as a seemingly ordinary young man against the backdrop of serious criminal allegations is striking. As the investigation continues, the full scope of his actions and any possible networks will likely be critically examined.

Public response to Rahami's capture has been mixed, with many expressing relief at the swift action by law enforcement while simultaneously fearing the implications of such violent acts occurring in their communities.

Real_83-Webpage,Trump’s puzzling pitch to black voters,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

Story Continued Below

The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

“The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

“We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.

But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night.

“I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”

Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach.

“I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?”

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

“Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

“I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.”

Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.”

“The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.”

Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.

“They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”

In an overt attempt to connect with African-American voters, former President Donald Trump took to the pulpit of a historically African-American church in Cleveland. This event was marked by a blend of polarizing remarks and contentious proposals, positioning Trump as a candidate he believes can address the issues facing urban America. As he seeks to enhance his image amidst ongoing allegations of racism from Democrats, his approach at this church service has drawn both support and significant backlash.

During his address, Trump proposed an extensive expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing. This controversial strategy has long been associated with accusations of racial profiling, particularly in black communities, where the practice has been widely criticized for its disproportionate impact on African-American individuals. The proposal raised eyebrows and sparked conversations about the implications of such a policy if implemented on a larger scale.

The backdrop of the Cleveland event featured boxing promoter Don King, who introduced Trump. King, a controversial figure in his own right, praised the former president vocally and elicited a shocked response when he used the N-word during his speech. This moment underscored the event’s divisive nature and highlighted the complexities of Trump's outreach strategy, which attempts to navigate racial dynamics within the community.

Trump's campaign oscillates between targeting predominantly white audiences and making significant appearances within African-American spaces. His recent comments have drawn scrutiny, particularly as he has made polarizing remarks about the state of black communities. His insistence that he can provide solutions to the challenges facing these communities is viewed with skepticism by many, including civil rights leaders.

In a recent town hall discussion with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump doubled down on his endorsement of stop-and-frisk policing, asserting that the tactic had proven effective during its implementation in New York City. Such statements have drawn sharp criticism from prominent civil rights leaders, including Rep. John Lewis, who challenged Trump's assertion that conditions for African-Americans have worsened. Lewis’s remarks reflect a wider concern within the African-American community about the sincerity of Trump's campaign promises.

Despite Trump's efforts to broaden his appeal, his support among African-American voters remains historically low. Many analysts suggest that his outreach is primarily designed to convince moderate white voters of his non-racist stance rather than genuinely engage with the needs and concerns of black voters. This strategy raises questions about the authenticity of his commitment to addressing the issues affecting largely marginalized communities.

In a bid to illustrate a shift from traditional Republican parallels, Trump was accompanied at the Cleveland event by a diverse group of advisors. This move seemingly aims to bolster his image as an inclusive candidate who can traverse the divided political landscape. By showcasing diversity among his advisors, Trump hopes to distance himself from the stereotypical perceptions often associated with his party.

Contradictions in Trump’s narrative regarding policing were evident as he addressed the recent shooting of an unarmed black man by law enforcement. In a rare moment of critique, Trump condemned the conduct of police in that incident. However, this criticism is atypical, as he typically defends law enforcement actions in similar cases. This duality raises questions about the sincerity of his critiques and whether they are merely tactical rather than indicative of a genuine commitment to reform.

The presence of Don King at the Cleveland church was emblematic of the event's intentions, particularly in presenting Trump as a figure who could disrupt the political system that oppresses minorities. King’s controversial history precedes him, yet his endorsement of Trump aimed to legitimize the former president’s efforts in the eyes of some community members. Nevertheless, such partnerships have the potential to alienate other segments of the community critical of both Trump and King’s past actions.

Amid the criticisms, Trump's attorney Michael Cohen came to his defense, asserting that the former president perceives all races as integral to the human narrative. Cohen's remarks seek to counteract the media's portrayal of Trump as racially insensitive and highlight his attempts to connect with African-American voters in a more substantive way.

As the campaign unfolds, Trump emphasizes that Democrats have abandoned black voters, insisting that he seeks to engage with them earnestly and actively. This narrative serves as a cornerstone of his campaigning strategy, aimed at framing Trump as the candidate who is willing to listen and act on the concerns of African-Americans. However, the question remains whether his actions will resonate with the community or further entrench skepticism about his sincerity.

This campaign strategy reflects a broader trend of political efforts to engage diverse voter bases, particularly in key electoral states like Ohio. As the election cycle intensifies, Trump's approach in settings such as the Cleveland church provides insight into how he plans to navigate the complexities of race relations in America. Whether this strategy will yield tangible results in changing perceptions among black voters or simply remain a footnote in a contentious election remains to be seen.

In conclusion, Trump's campaign stop at the historic Cleveland church signals a crucial moment as he tries to rectify his standing with African-American voters. However, with misleading claims, controversial endorsements, and defensive rhetoric surrounding his past actions, the effectiveness of his outreach initiatives continues to be a subject of intense scrutiny and debate. As we move forward, the implications of this strategy will be closely watched, revealing much about the evolving landscape of American politics and race dynamics in the lead-up to the upcoming elections.",-67.0,-9.0,1178.0,-1.8108108108108107,-0.056876061120543296,1020.0,-0.23076923076923078,-0.008823529411764706

Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged.

“If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.”

Story Continued Below

Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.”

Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.

But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.”

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.”

Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.

Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.

“I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.”

He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.

“I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.

Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a prominent figure in the ""birther"" movement, recently expressed his views on Donald Trump's comments concerning former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. During an appearance at a conservative gathering in Phoenix, Arpaio highlighted that Trump has not labeled Obama's birth certificate as ""legitimate,"" which he interprets as a positive development for those who question Obama's birthplace.

Arpaio noted that Trump's remarks, which merely acknowledged Obama's birthplace, do not confirm the legitimacy of the birth certificate itself. ""I find it curious what information Trump might have on the birthplace,"" Arpaio stated. Despite Trump's acknowledgment, he made it clear that this aspect did not concern him and did not detract from the ongoing discourse surrounding the validity of the controversial document.

Back in 2011, following the publication of Obama's birth certificate online, Arpaio took the initiative to launch an investigation into its authenticity. His assertion that the document is forged has been a central theme in his public commentary ever since. Arpaio's long-standing position on the matter indicates that he believes significant questions remain unanswered regarding the origins of the birth certificate.

Trump's connection to the birther movement has often been framed within a broader discussion on race. His political ascent was partly fueled by insinuations surrounding Obama's birthplace, something critics have described as racially charged. However, under public pressure, Trump later distanced himself from these birther allegations, inaccurately attributing the rumor's origins to Hillary Clinton.

Despite Trump's denials, Arpaio remains adamant about the findings from his office's investigation. He maintains that his team has uncovered no evidence to support the birth certificate's legitimacy. “Our focus has always been on the document itself, not on where Obama was born,” Arpaio emphasized, rejecting any suggestions of racial motivation behind his skepticism.

Moreover, Arpaio candidly admitted to reporters that he does not know definitively where Obama was born and has encountered numerous tales surrounding the issue. This admission reflects a certain level of uncertainty and openness in his views, allowing for the discussion to continue within the realm of speculation.

Arpaio also revealed that he and Trump had not discussed the contentious birth certificate issue leading up to Trump's recent comments at a press conference. The fact that this topic had not been directly addressed between them adds an interesting layer to their respective stances.

Overall, as Arpaio continues to challenge the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate, his remarks indicate that the debate surrounding this issue is far from over. With his ongoing investigation and public commentary, Arpaio remains a vocal advocate for the birther movement, seeking to shed light on questions he feels are still pertinent to Americans who have doubted the legitimacy of Obama's presidency. As discussions unfold, the political implications of this topic continue to reverberate through conservative circles, bringing with them a myriad of opinions and sentiments.",-9.0,-6.0,533.0,-0.5625,-0.016885553470919325,565.0,-0.2857142857142857,-0.010619469026548672
Real_85-Webpage,Barack Obama at Benjamin Netanyahu meeting: 'He is always very candid with us',"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month

His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office.

Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency.

""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us.""

That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January.

Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

Real_86-Webpage,McAuliffe hangs with Willie Nelson -- and his weed,"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana

Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert

(CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed.

It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!""

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is.

""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool.""

The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

Real_87-Webpage,The Mystery of Trump’s Man in Moscow: Carter Page,"In March, in a bold “Oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the Washington Post’s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, “I have quite a few more.” The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “Carter Page, PhD.”

Who?

Story Continued Below

Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.”

This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.

“What’s this guy’s name?” says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.

“I had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. “But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘Have you heard of this guy?’”

“Strangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,” Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. “It's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.”

Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.

This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. “I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.” As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?

Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (“I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’” says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump’s own campaign.

What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. “He’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,” says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia’s state oil giant. “People really respect him in this industry. He’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials—including Rosneft head Igor Sechin—during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.

Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at Gazprom,” the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in Russia” and an office “around the corner from Trump Tower.”

Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, “Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a “famous American economist” and “adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.”

All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in Trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.

But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to Page’s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.

So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?

***

I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page’s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.

This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.

OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn’t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive résumé.

Page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. “He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,” his bio reads. “He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.”

Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page’s tenure in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.

So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn’t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “I don’t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says Craig . “It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.”

When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page’s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, “I rolled my eyes at that one.” (He, too, said he hadn’t heard of Page until Trump’s announcement.)

Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?

Turns out, they did.

“His nickname was stranichkin,” from the Russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. “It really irritated our team,” Torchinsky told me over Skype. “We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. These guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” As for Page, “He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” Torchinsky says. “When you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.”

OK, harsh. But then I talked to Page’s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. “He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me.

Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says Aleksashenko.

When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” And, says Aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.”

Trump’s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says Aleksashenko.

***

For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,” he wrote. “Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (“Slave; Pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.

His speech in Moscow’s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “For the last 15 years, I’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak Russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: “We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.” Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.

Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. “He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “That blog post about the slaves. That’s just … strange,” says the Council member.

“He’s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. “You’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.”

I should’ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump’s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.

I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page’s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?

But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch’s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “No one let him into Gazprom,” Aleksashenko says. “He didn’t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller’s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.” Another of Page’s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page’s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year… I used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.”

But the meetings did provide him with something else. “Gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them.

After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father’s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from Trump Tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space.

“That’s Carter Page,” says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. “That’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. He’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.”

In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia’s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“I don’t know this person,” said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page’s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. “I give them money, I don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,” he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “Don’t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.”

“You are engaged in onanism,” said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. “It’s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It’s absurd.”

As for the FBI investigation, well, it’s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.” He added, “the story doesn't add up.” What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page’s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.”

***

I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?

“Who?” says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.

“He has no formal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.

Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks’s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?

One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.

One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump’s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,” Burt told me. “And I told him I’d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I’ve forgotten. He’s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?”

Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump’s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. “If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,” this person told me.

“I’m not answering your questions,” Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “Carter Page isn’t someone I’ve interacted with.” Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: “Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He’s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.”

***

Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“Who?” Maybe I wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.

“I don’t know about his Russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. “Every conversation I’ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” He went on. “I couldn’t name a project that I could connect Carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.”

“I don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but I think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.”

Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, “a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ‘I want to be part of the team,’” says the Trump adviser. And that’s how it happened. “He’s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ‘He’s an adviser.’ And now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.”

Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,” one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,” the Russia specialist recalls. “He didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.”

According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page’s trip to Russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.” But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “It’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America’s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It’s what’s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carré novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?”

This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “If Page using his status as ‘Trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: “Carter Page, Ph.D.” Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.

For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?

There doesn’t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,” Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.

In March of this year, Donald Trump unveiled a brief list of foreign policy advisers during a rally that caught the attention of many, not least because of the inclusion of Carter Page, PhD. This announcement puzzled observers who were eager to understand the rationale behind Trump's selection of Page, as his background and connections raised numerous questions.

#### **Carter Page: The Man Behind the Controversy**

Carter Page is known as the founder of Global Energy Capital, an investment firm that claims to specialize in Russian investments and the energy sector. With an academic pedigree typical for an adviser, his PhD suggests a level of expertise that might appease some skeptics. However, a closer examination of Page's credentials reveals a tumultuous professional reputation.

Despite his ties to the Trump campaign, feedback from the expat business community in Russia indicates that few were familiar with Page or his work. This lack of recognition leads to inquiries about the legitimacy of his self-proclaimed status as an expert in energy finance and foreign policy. In a field where network and reputation are paramount, Page’s obscure presence raised eyebrows and fueled speculation about the authenticity of his role.

#### **Investigations and Allegations: A Cloud of Suspicion**

Compounding the confusion surrounding Page's position, reports surfaced indicating that U.S. intelligence agencies were investigating him for alleged connections with Russian officials. Such investigations often lead to heightened scrutiny of individuals tied to public figures; in this case, Trump's advisory network faced increased examination. The implications of these reports were significant, given the existing concerns regarding Russian interference in U.S. elections and foreign relations.

As Trump’s foreign policy knowledge has been criticized for its muddled understanding of key Middle Eastern groups and figures, Page's association with the campaign brings its own set of challenges. Critics have questioned not only Trump's broader foreign policy acumen but also the caliber of the individuals he has chosen to surround himself with.

#### **A Questionable Background in Energy Finance**

Carter Page’s professional history includes a vice president position at Merrill Lynch, yet his tenure there was met with skepticism. Former colleagues described him as lacking the necessary competence in energy finance to make a meaningful impact, casting doubt on his claimed expertise within the energy sector. This skepticism deepened when Page asserted that he had advised major deals linked to prominent Russian companies such as Gazprom and RAO UES.

Industry professionals dismissed these claims, characterizing them as exaggerated or unfounded. Page's background thus presents a curious contradiction; he positions himself as a seasoned expert in international energy dealings while simultaneously facing doubts from those who worked alongside him.

#### **Self-Presentation and Perception**

Page has portrayed himself as a foreign policy expert, yet this self-presentation has come under fire. Various commentators have described his writing and declarations as convoluted and lacking academic or practical substance. In the highly scrutinized world of foreign policy, clarity and credibility are valued above all, and Page’s reported failure to deliver on both fronts casts a long shadow over his qualifications.

Compounding the problem for Trump’s foreign policy team is the revelation that many senior advisers were unaware of Page's substantial role within the campaign. Reports suggested that Trump had never met Page personally, further complicating the narrative surrounding his involvement. This disconnect raises important questions: How significant is Page's advisory role, and how effectively does he contribute to shaping policy perspectives?

#### **Speculation and Mystique: The Line Between Adviser and Opportunist**

As investigations into Page's dealings continue, particularly regarding a trip to Moscow, speculation about his motivations and affiliations intensifies. Observers are left to consider whether Page is, in fact, a credible adviser or if he is simply leveraging his association with Trump for personal gain. The intricacies of his connections to Russian interests and how they might intersect with U.S. political dynamics endure as focal points of analysis.

This raises critical questions about the blurred lines between influence and opportunity in the context of foreign policy. The potential implications of Russian interference in U.S. politics cannot be overstated, with figures like Page at the center of this ongoing debate. 

#### **Conclusion: The Fallout from Controversial Associations**

As the complexities surrounding Carter Page, Trump's foreign policy advisory network, and allegations of Russian interference continue to unfold, observers are left grappling with a myriad of concerns. The interplay of personal ambition, questionable expertise, and foreign influence paints a complicated picture of the present political landscape. In the pursuit of understanding these complicated matrices of power, one thing remains clear: the world will be watching closely as these investigations unfold, and as they do, they will shape the narratives that dominate both political discourse and international relations for years to come. 

Only time will tell how the perceptions of Page's role will evolve, and whether any new revelations will emerge to reshape the current understanding of his status and connections. For now, the portfolio of Donald Trump's foreign policy landscape remains a rich ground for investigation and analysis, with Carter Page at its intriguing, yet contentious, center.",27.0,-16.0,6589.0,0.12796208530805686,0.004097738655334649,1008.0,-0.47058823529411764,-0.015873015873015872
Real_88-Webpage,It’s “Trump is HITLER” Month at the Washington Post – Eagle Rising,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post.

On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part,

(…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is.

Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

Real_89-Webpage,Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore,"2016 Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore The president’s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.

They’re not laughing anymore.

Story Continued Below

Going into Monday night’s debate, Obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.

“I’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “I feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘Breaking Bad’ here. We’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.”

“There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,” said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.

Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He’s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare—support Democrats.

For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there’s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.

“We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. “But we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.”

Trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.

And the result: Trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama’s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.

Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.

“I don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, I don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.”

But they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama’s America.

“I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. “He’s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.”

For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “Trump has shattered that,” Vietor said. “He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. That’s a bad lesson for people to learn.”

According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton’s chances.

“I’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.

Not everyone’s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.

“He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.

And Democrats’ sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.

“The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,” said Earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.”

But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.

“I’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” Papa said, “than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”

**Introduction**

As the 2016 presidential election approached, the unexpected rise of Donald Trump within the Republican Party created an environment ripe with uncertainty and anxiety, even among those who had previously been confident in the political landscape dominated by Barack Obama’s administration. Initially met with bemusement, Obama’s team soon found themselves grappling with very real concerns about the implications of a Trump presidency, reflecting broader sentiments within the American electorate. 

**A Calculated Laugh—Then Reality Sets In**

At first, Obama’s aides found humor in Trump’s ascendancy, believing that Republicans had crafted their own predicament. In their view, Trump’s unconventional approach and incendiary rhetoric were self-inflicted wounds on a party already facing numerous challenges. This initial levity, however, morphed into a sense of foreboding as the election neared, with anxiety mounting over Trump’s potential presidency and what it could mean for the nation. 

The political landscape showcased an unsettling trend that cut to the heart of the Obama administration’s legacy. Former aides began to express growing concerns about widespread resentment towards Obama and his policies—a sentiment that appeared to transcend political boundaries. The reality that the backlash against his presidency could be more extensive than anyone had anticipated raised eyebrows among those who had been deeply involved in shaping his administration. 

**A Moment of Reflection for the Former President**

In private moments, Obama found himself reflecting on the challenges he faced during his presidency. He pondered about the connections he had established with Americans—particularly those who may have felt left behind despite benefiting from his policies. It was an introspective moment focused on his communication strategy and engagement methods, leading him to wonder how he might have better resonated with diverse demographics across the country.

While Obama enjoyed rising approval ratings, Trump’s presence served as a stark reminder of the deep divisions permeating American society. The former president recognized that these divisions were not just superficial but indicative of a significant failure on his part to engage certain voter bases. The realization was sobering; it underscored the narrative that the nation was far from united, a concern that weighed heavily on his aides as they navigated the final months leading up to the election.

**The Trump Phenomenon: A New Political Landscape**

Trump’s ability to mainstream racially charged rhetoric provided a tangible concern for Obama’s team. The former reality television star successfully attracted financial support from various sectors, demonstrating a troubling viability as a candidate. What was initially viewed as a passing phenomenon by some gradual reports indicated a far closer electoral race between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton than early polling had suggested.

This precarious situation led to introspective debates within Obama’s circle. Some aides countered the narrative that Trumpism should be viewed as a part of Obama’s legacy. They argued vehemently that the responsibility for the current state of the Republican Party rested with Republican leadership and their mishandling of the political discourse over the years.

**The Irreparable Damage: Trump’s Potential Impact**

Despite expectations of Trump's potential defeat in the election, deep-seated concerns lingered about the lasting damage his candidacy could inflict on American politics. His approach stood in stark contrast to the civil political discourse that Obama had sought to promote throughout his time in office. Trump’s aggressive style did not merely reshape political strategy; it instigated a broader discussion about the future of political rivalry in the United States.

Obama lamented what he perceived as the deterioration of a functional opposition party. The gridlock stymied progress on critical issues like immigration reform and infrastructure improvements, highlighting the limitations of a political environment where constructive debate had been overshadowed by vitriol. 

**Looking Beyond the Election: Implications for the GOP**

Amidst a tumultuous political climate, some within Obamaworld saw ray of hope in one aspect: the long-term damage to the Republican Party’s brand that could arise from Trump’s candidacy. The factional strife and the polarizing nature of Trump’s political style prompted musings about a potential reckoning for the GOP post-election. 

What was clear to many was a desire for a political environment characterized by competitiveness but one that did not legitimize extremist views. Critics of Trump’s approach voiced concerns over the appropriation of such extremities within mainstream conversation and the sacrifices that came with accepting a more aggressive form of political engagement. 

**Conclusion**

As the 2016 election cycle unfolded, the complexities of the political landscape became starkly clear to those within Obama’s administration. From a mix of humor and disbelief at Trump’s initial rise to an intense examination of their own strategies and connections with the American populace, Obama’s team faced a backdrop of anxiety marked by a recognition of burgeoning divisions within the country. Concerns about Trump’s potential to reshape American politics loomed large, prompting reflections on the state of political discourse and the long-term implications of a changing party landscape.

With time, it became evident to all involved that the election was not merely a contest for the presidency; it was a litmus test for the future of political dialogue in America, a challenge encapsulated in the struggle between civil engagement and the allure of more divisive, confrontational tactics. Ultimately, the desire and hope for a competitive but functional political environment remained, despite the turbulence surrounding Trump’s candidacy and the ensuing questions it raised.",-9.0,15.0,1354.0,-0.24324324324324326,-0.0066469719350073855,1045.0,0.4411764705882353,0.014354066985645933

Washington (CNN) Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a tight race in in Georgia, a traditionally deep red state, according to a new poll.

The Republican candidate has 45% to Clinton's 42% in the Monmouth University poll, within the poll's margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson had the support of 8% of likely voters.

Trump is underperforming previous GOP candidates. Mitt Romney won the state by 8 points in 2012 over President Barack Obama.

The incumbent Republican senator is also out-polling Trump. Sen. Johnny Isakson has a 16-point lead over challenger Jim Barksdale, 50% to 34%.

Clinton's strength comes from the Atlanta area, where she leads Trump 55% to 35%. But Trump leads her 51% to 33% elsewhere in the Peach State. She leads 88% to 4% among the state's black voters, but trails 20% to 66% among white voters.

Real_90-Webpage,Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

“Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”

Adding:

“This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”

Chelsea then said:

“Stop telling women to smile. We don’t like that. It’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”

Going for Priebus’ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

“You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.”

And that’s exactly right.

Handler argued that the expectation for women to smile is not only outdated but also belittling.

This disparity raises important questions about the way women's emotions and expressions are policed in public life.

This remark resonates with many who feel that such directives reduce women to trivializing their roles, especially in high-stakes environments like political forums.

Handler continued the discussion with a light-hearted jab, suggesting that perhaps women will naturally smile more when Hillary Clinton recovers from her recent pneumonia and secures a victory against Donald Trump in the upcoming election.

Real_91-Webpage,Is Donald Trump qualified to be president?,"Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.

H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.”

Likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.

Story Continued Below

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.

But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump’s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?

1. Does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country?

Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump — who swooned after Clinton’s superb convention in Philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.

His resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.

The first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream.

This is not to suggest that Trump can’t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.

Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates — but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care.

The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. “When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.”

Stone argued that Trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.

Trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.

Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD’s Section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?

2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?

Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: “We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.”

That’s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: “For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “Article 12 of the Constitution.” The framers stopped at seven. “He was just listing out numbers,” said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. “I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.”

OK, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “Free Exercise” clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.

3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?

Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.

But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.

Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much).

More serious is the issue of Trump’s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns.

This isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.

4. What’s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there’s the matter of Trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In exposé after exposé, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.

The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.

5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.

But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.

Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary” in Trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.

But it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially George W. Bush’s claims about Iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read POLITICO’s comprehensive “Donald Trump’s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths” for a taste.)

In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “Clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…”

But getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. It’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.

- Trump’s campaign relies on broad ideas, but he lacks understanding of basic facts and history, often exhibiting an aversion to reading and detailed briefings.
- Significant questions raised about Trump’s qualifications include:
  1. His knowledge and commitment to understanding the critical information required to govern.
  2. His understanding and respect for American constitutional principles, including press freedoms.
  3. His refusal to disclose information about his businesses and debts, raising transparency issues regarding his wealth and foreign creditors.
  4. Concerns regarding the management of his charitable foundation and allegations of misuse of funds.

In the landscape of American politics, presidential debates serve as pivotal moments that not only shape the campaign but also test candidates under the scrutiny of public scrutiny. The first presidential debate of 2016 was no exception, presenting itself as a significant ""job interview"" for Donald Trump. As the Republican nominee, Trump's participation in the debate was essential, as he faced questions that delved deep into his qualifications for the presidency amidst a crowded field of concerns regarding his candidacy.

Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, entered this arena as the most scrutinized candidate in American history, having undergone extensive vetting throughout her political career. In contrast, Trump's history remained shrouded in opacity. With a campaign steeped in broad, sweeping concepts rather than detailed policy frameworks, Trump had consistently evaded the responsibility of demonstrating his grasp of the critical facts necessary for informed governance. His perceived aversion to reading and engaging in detailed briefings further compounded concerns about his preparedness for the presidential office.

As the debate loomed, significant questions about Trump's qualifications emerged. These inquiries were not merely academic; they resonated deeply with voters seeking assurance about their next president's capacity to govern effectively. Each question cast a shadow over his candidacy and was pivotal for his image as a leader ready to take on the highest office in the land.

First and foremost, the issue of Trump's knowledge—and commitment to understanding—critical information required for governance took center stage. Voters wondered whether Trump could navigate the complexities of national and international issues, given his historical reluctance to engage with detailed policy discussions. The ability to grasp such information is vital for any presidential candidate, as the governance of a country involves not only lofty ideals but also the navigation of intricate facts and figures that inform effective decision-making.

Moreover, the debate highlighted concerns over Trump's understanding and respect for American constitutional principles. Fundamental to the role of the presidency is a candidate's appreciation for the rights enshrined in the Constitution, including vital press freedoms. Trump's past comments and behaviors raised alarms about his respect for these principles, leaving debate audiences and voters alike to question whether he would uphold the foundational tenets of American democracy if elected.

Transparency emerged as another significant issue during the debate preparation period. Trump's refusal to disclose detailed information regarding his businesses and debts became a focal point of public concern. Questions surrounding his wealth and foreign creditors drew attention to the potential conflicts of interest that could arise should he be elected. Voters sought transparency in a candidate, particularly one with a controversial business background, but Trump's reticence only intensified the scrutiny surrounding his financial dealings.

Compounding these issues were allegations regarding the management of Trump's charitable foundation. Concerns over the potential misuse of funds within this organization created further apprehension about his candidacy. If a candidate undermines the very tenets of charitable giving, what confidence can voters have in their ability to uplift the nation as president?

The debate was also positioned against a backdrop of skepticism regarding Trump's credibility. A pattern of misleading statements and outright dishonesty had characterized his campaign. Voters grappled with the implications of such behavior, raising critical questions about the trustworthiness of a man who aspired to hold the most powerful office in the world. The integrity and honesty of a presidential candidate are paramount; however, Trump's history had already prompted inquiries into whether he could foster a truthful dialogue with the American public.

As the debate approached, it became increasingly clear that while Trump displayed a certain political skill, there was a marked distinction between political cunning and the ability to govern effectively. The former may help navigate the tumultuous waters of campaigns, but the latter requires a depth of understanding, intellectual curiosity, and a commitment to the nuances of policy that Trump's history seemed to lack.

The episode also spotlighted Trump's deficiency in intellectual curiosity. His reluctance to engage deeply with the subjects necessitated for informed decision-making posed serious risks for future governance. A president needs to approach issues with an open mind and a thirst for knowledge. The expectation is not just to appear for a photo op but to delve into the complexities of topics ranging from foreign policy to domestic welfare. As voters reflected on this, his intellectual shortcomings became an obstacle that could hinder effective governance.

As the debate unfolded, it was viewed as a crucial turning point—a chance for Trump to pivot from his campaigning strategies towards demonstrating his readiness to occupy the highest office in the nation. However, lingering doubts about his competencies remained palpable.

For Trump, the first presidential debate in 2016 represented more than just a performance on a national stage; it was a defining moment that could either bolster his credentials or expose vulnerabilities that had been simmering below the surface. The stakes were high, and the world watched closely, awaiting his responses to questions that could either reassure or further alarm the American electorate.

Ultimately, the challenge for Trump was clear: he needed to approach the debate not just as a competitive forum but as an opportunity to prove to the American people that he possessed the requisite knowledge, respect for constitutional principles, transparency, and integrity essential for the presidency. Whether he could translate his political messaging into the assurance needed for the American people remained to be seen. The debate's outcome would have lasting implications as the campaign moved forward, shaping the public's perception of his ability to lead the nation.",18.0,37.0,2547.0,0.21686746987951808,0.007067137809187279,1040.0,0.9024390243902439,0.035576923076923075
