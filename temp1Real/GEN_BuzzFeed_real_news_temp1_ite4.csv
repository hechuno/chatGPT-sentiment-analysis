Real_1-Webpage,Another Terrorist Attack in NYC…Why Are we STILL Being Politically Correct – Eagle Rising,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

On September 17 at 8:30 PM EST, a shocking explosion occurred on West 23rd Street in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, leaving 29 individuals injured. The explosion originated from a homemade bomb carefully placed inside a dumpster, causing alarm and chaos in the vibrant community known for its shops, restaurants, and cultural scene. Fortunately, authorities reported no fatalities as a result of the blast.

The immediate response from local law enforcement was swift and thorough. Police were on the scene within minutes, and by 2:25 AM, the explosive device had been safely removed and transported for analysis to a lab in Quantico, Virginia. Investigators were eager to determine the origins and mechanics of the device that wreaked havoc on the bustling street.

Adding to the tense atmosphere, a second bomb—a pressure cooker device—was discovered later on West 27th Street. This discovery raised concerns amongst law enforcement and the public, as it indicated the possibility of a coordinated effort behind the attacks in Manhattan.

Despite the frightening circumstances, all 29 injured individuals were released from the hospital by Sunday morning, offering a semblance of relief to the affected individuals and their families. Their swift recovery stood in sharp juxtaposition to the specter of violence that had just trailed through their community.

The Chelsea explosion did not occur in isolation; it closely followed a related bomb incident that took place in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. Early Saturday morning, as crowds gathered for a charity race, an explosive device detonated in a trash can, fortunately without causing any injuries. In a significant development, law enforcement officials revealed by Sunday afternoon that the explosives identified in Chelsea and Seaside Heights were linked to the same individual, suggesting a broader threat possibly extending beyond Manhattan.

In the aftermath of the explosion, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the media, confirming that while the incident was intentional, it did not appear to stem from any specific terrorist threats. Additionally, New York Police Commissioner James O’Neill dismissed the possibility of a natural gas leak being a contributing factor in the Chelsea explosion, steering focus towards the explosive nature of the homemade bombs.

Governor Andrew Cuomo took a firmer stance, categorizing the explosion as an act of terrorism, despite a lack of evidence linking it to recognized international terrorist groups. ""This is serious, and it should be treated as such,"" Cuomo emphasized, highlighting the potential for similar threats in the future. The governor's remarks mirrored the broader sentiments filtering through the public and political landscape regarding safety and security in urban environments.

Political figures quickly responded, underscoring the incident's implications for national security and public safety. President candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both took the opportunity to voice their positions on the matter. Trump endorsed a robust response to terrorism, stating that the safety of citizens should be the utmost priority for leaders in the wake of such attacks. Clinton emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach to security that includes preventive measures against homegrown threats.

The events in Chelsea and New Jersey highlight the troubling realities of urban life, particularly concerning the vulnerability of ""soft targets""—locations frequented by the public with little security measures in place. With increasing concerns over domestic terrorism and the potential for further attacks, community leaders and residents alike are calling for strong leadership to safeguard citizens against evolving threats. 

As investigations continue, the relationship between the incidents in Chelsea and Seaside Heights raises critical questions about how communities can better protect themselves from potential future attacks. The coordination of law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities will likely play a vital role in addressing these challenges. 

The Chelsea explosion is a stark reminder of the heightened sense of vulnerability that often accompanies urban life in today's environment. Community members are left grappling with the reality that even seemingly mundane gatherings can be disrupted by acts of violence. As discussions surrounding resilience and preparedness unfold, the dedication of local law enforcement agencies, emergency services, and community leaders will be essential in ensuring public safety and restoring a sense of normalcy. 

In the days following the attack, the community has rallied together, reaffirming their commitment to one another and demonstrating resilience in the face of fear. Public sentiment currently leans toward frank discussions about safety measures, support for victims, and a united front against those who seek to disrupt the tranquility of everyday life.

Although the author’s interpretations and opinions on the matter do not necessarily reflect those of EagleRising.com, it is evident that the Chelsea explosion marks a critical juncture for discussions surrounding security, community response, and the ever-present threat of violence in modern society. As the investigation unfolds, the community remains on edge, hopeful that answers await and that their neighborhood will emerge united from the fragments of this violent act.",-43.0,-36.0,930.0,-1.2285714285714286,-0.046236559139784944,909.0,-1.0909090909090908,-0.039603960396039604
Real_10-Webpage,"Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests","Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.

""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.

The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.

""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""

He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.

""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""

But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.

Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.

During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""

Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.

Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.

""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.

In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",http://abcn.ws/2d4lNn9,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg,"More Candace,Adam Kelsey,Abc News,More Adam",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437,"{""fb_title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@adam_kels"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-22"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-22"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-22 14:33:00"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh""}","- Protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, turned violent following the police killing of African-American man Keith Lamont Scott.

Charlotte, North Carolina has found itself at the center of national controversy as protests erupted following the police killing of African-American man Keith Lamont Scott. The aftermath of Scott's death has reignited calls for justice and accountability within law enforcement agencies across the United States. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets, demanding justice and an end to systemic racism in policing practices. However, what began as protests for justice quickly escalated into violence, raising concerns about public safety and community relations.

In Pittsburgh, responding to the turmoil in Charlotte and other cities, Donald Trump addressed the unrest during his speech at the Shale Insight 2016 Conference. He attributed a portion of the violence in the communities to the impact of drugs, suggesting that substance abuse plays a pivotal role in exacerbating tensions and criminal activity. Trump's stance emphasizes a need to control urban areas as a means to bolster American global leadership and stability. 

While Trump condemned the violence that unfolded during the protests, he called for unity among Americans, arguing that addressing such issues collectively is imperative for the nation. His remarks underscored the necessity of supporting law enforcement and enhancing training for police officers, reflecting his administration's commitment to improving police-community relations. Nevertheless, amidst his calls for unity and emphasis on law enforcement, he notably refrained from acknowledging the ongoing pattern of violence against African-Americans committed by police, a central grievance raised by many activists and protesters.

In an effort to engage with African-American voters, Trump has previously questioned what they have to lose by voting for him, framing his message against a backdrop of harsh realities that he claims plague inner cities. He portrayed conditions in African-American communities as dire, contending that they are in critical need of intervention and reform. However, these sweeping generalizations have earned him criticism from several quarters, with observers noting that such statements overlook the diversity and complexity within these communities.

Data from various sources indicates that a significant number of black Americans hold college degrees and that many do not live in poverty—contradicting Trump's broad characterizations. Critics argue that Trump's rhetoric can diminish the achievements and positive aspects present within the communities he aims to serve.

During a visit to Cleveland, Trump broached the concept of ""stop and frisk"" as a policing strategy, intending to discuss its application in addressing crime. He later clarified that such tactics should be limited to specific cities, with Chicago cited as a particular focus. The endorsement of this controversial approach has sparked debates about its effectiveness and implications for community relationships. Proponents argue that it can lead to crime reduction, while detractors label it as an infringement on civil rights and an exacerbation of mistrust between law enforcement and African-American communities.

In delineating his position, Trump made a point to distinguish between ""violent disruptors"" and the broader black community. His intention appears to be the promotion of a narrative aimed at assisting African-American families, stating that the ultimate objective should be to uplift their living conditions and opportunities.

The situation in Charlotte reflects a broader national discourse about race relations, policing, and community safety in America. As protests persist and calls for accountability grow louder, it remains to be seen how leaders will navigate these pressing concerns. The focus must shift towards fostering unity and establishing dialogue rather than perpetuating division. Creating pathways for meaningful solutions will require understanding and addressing the underlying issues that have led to the strife seen in Charlotte and other cities across the nation.

The dialogue surrounding the relationship between law enforcement and communities of color has become increasingly critical in the wake of high-profile incidents and subsequent unrest. As voices call out for justice and systemic change, thoughtful engagement from all parties involved may pave the way for progress. The tension in Charlotte serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggles for equity, acknowledgment, and coexistence within a diverse society.

Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.

Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”

So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.

Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.

How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right?

In a pivotal address to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama articulated the intricate relationship between individual liberties and national security, suggesting that a recalibration of this balance may be necessary in an increasingly interconnected world. His remarks ignited discussion on the concept of relinquishing certain freedoms in exchange for heightened safety, underscoring the importance of international cooperation in navigating these complex challenges.

Obama emphasized that the United States faces criticism for fully endorsing international norms and multilateral institutions. This criticism, both domestically and abroad, highlights the skepticism many feel about committing to global frameworks that might seem to infringe on national sovereignty. However, he urged that adherence to international rules could ultimately enhance long-term security without sacrificing the country’s core interests, a stance that invites further examination and debate.

The former president presented a powerful argument regarding the plight of refugees, suggesting that aiding nations accommodating those fleeing conflict and persecution would contribute to a more stable and secure world. This humanitarian approach reflects a broader understanding that stability is often rooted in kindness and cooperation rather than isolation. Obama’s advocacy for international support of refugees arises from an awareness that collective efforts have the potential to mitigate future conflicts and, by extension, reduce security threats at home.

While his speech addressed various pressing issues, it was not without controversy. Critics pointed out that Obama failed to clearly delineate how the proposal to give up some personal freedoms would concretely enhance safety within the United States. This lack of clarity has led to skepticism about the practicality of his suggestions and whether the sacrifice of certain liberties can be justified in exchange for security.

Moreover, concerns were raised regarding the policies of other nations, particularly Germany, in the wake of their refugee policies, which some observers argue may inadvertently lead to increased danger and societal tensions. Such points highlight the complexity of international refugee assistance, interweaving humanitarian needs with security considerations, thus presenting a challenging dilemma for policymakers.

Obama’s address also referenced the alarming presence of recent terrorist attacks within the U.S., further punctuating the urgency of his argument. The shadow of these tragedies looms large over discussions of safety and freedom, prompting an ongoing reassessment of how best to protect citizens while honoring fundamental democratic principles.

At the same time, he faced criticism for his stance on the United Nations, particularly the idea that the U.S. could become subject to UN authority. Many perceive this as a threat to individual freedom and constitutional rights. Critics argue that such a shift could alter the balance of power in ways that undermine the cherished liberties upon which the nation was built. This skepticism resonates with a significant segment of the population, who remain wary of international governing bodies potentially overstepping their bounds.

In conclusion, Obama’s address at the UN General Assembly opened a necessary dialogue on a complex subject that sits at the intersection of security and individual liberties. While his call for greater international cooperation and support for refugees resonates with many humanitarian advocates, the accompanying concerns regarding the implications for national freedom cannot be overlooked. As discussions continue, striking the right balance will remain a critical issue for policymakers and citizens alike in an ever-evolving global landscape.",23.0,14.0,576.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03993055555555555,612.0,0.6363636363636364,0.02287581699346405
Real_12-Webpage,Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works,"Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump’s vision.

As he made clear once again in Monday night’s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.”

Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ‘I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “Incomes went up for everybody.”

Story Continued Below

That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “My whole life is about winning. … I always win,” Trump says in explaining why he’s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “Winning the Global Competition.” You don’t get more zero-sum than that.

Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–Trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.

The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.

Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.

No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan’s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.

Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.

Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.

The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders’ powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.

Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. They aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.

We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.

The 2016 presidential election has emerged as a profound reflection of America's economic anxieties, marked by contrasting perspectives on growth, opportunity, and the future of the nation’s labor force. Among the two foremost candidates—Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton—core economic beliefs underpin their electoral narratives, ultimately driving a wedge between segments of American society grappling with an evolving economic landscape.

Donald Trump’s worldview is steeped in a zero-sum economic framework. From his vantage point, the economy is akin to a competitive game—the gains of one party directly translate to the losses of another. This perspective has led him to vehemently criticize trade agreements like NAFTA, which he attributes to the erosion of American manufacturing jobs. Trump’s fervent rhetoric resonates powerfully with voters who perceive themselves as the economic “losers” of globalization and technological change. For them, his promises to revitalize manufacturing and bring jobs back to America are not mere campaign slogans; they are deep-seated hopes for restoration in a swiftly transforming economic environment.

On the other side of the political spectrum, Hillary Clinton presents a more optimistic economic outlook. She champions the belief that economic growth can be a collective benefit, suggesting that, unlike Trump’s narrative, it is possible for all to emerge victorious in this economic race. Recalling the successes of the Bill Clinton administration, she argues for a return to a more inclusive growth model—a vision where prosperity doesn't just favor a select few but can potentially uplift everyone. Her campaign seeks to broaden the conversation about economic possibility, emphasizing collaboration and collective progress.

This dichotomy highlights a fundamental rift in American society, where the electorate is increasingly divided between those who see winners and losers and those who envision a future where growth and opportunity abound without necessitating losses. While Trump’s stance resonates with individuals feeling disenfranchised in the changing economy, many economists argue that the zero-sum perspective is a misguided simplification of a complex economic reality. Most experts believe that the economy can grow in a manner that creates opportunities for everyone, challenging the notion that prosperity for one must come at the expense of another.

However, the narrative of economic improvement has not penetrated the consciousness of every American. Indicators such as a reported 5.2% increase in median income paint a picture of recovery; yet, this statistical progress masks the varied experiences of many citizens who remain anxious about their economic stability. Fear and insecurity often overshadow economic metrics, as many individuals perceive themselves as precarious participants in a labor market increasingly dominated by change.

Trump’s support base primarily consists of those who feel left behind—workers in the manufacturing sector, for instance, who have witnessed firsthand the decline of jobs that once offered a pathway to prosperity. For them, Trump's zero-sum rhetoric provides not only validation but also a rallying cry for reclaiming what they perceive as lost ground. Conversely, individuals who feel empowered by the current economic conditions tend to gravitate towards Clinton, embracing her more progressive and inclusive view of economic growth.

This polarization illustrates a broader narrative concerning contrasting worldviews about economic potential. On one end of the spectrum, ardent proponents of globalization and open markets passionately argue that such frameworks are pathways to a thriving middle class. Yet, amidst these aspirations, the struggles faced by countless Americans caught in economic transition are all too often overshadowed. The complexities of job displacement, wage stagnation, and the fallout from recent financial crises remain pervasive challenges that demand acknowledgment and effective policy in response.

Interestingly, Trump’s appeal does not solely rest on the sentiments of those feeling economically distressed. His rhetoric finds common ground among certain business leaders who resonate with his critique of the current financial dynamics. These individuals share a disillusionment regarding the status quo, especially in the wake of the 2008 crisis that reshaped both the economy and the corporate landscape. They see in Trump’s narrative not only a reflection of their struggles but also potential solutions to re-establishing what they view as a faltering economic order.

The historical backdrop of this confrontation between Trump and Clinton evokes the sentiments of the Progressive Movement of the 1890s. Much like the era’s leaders who emphasized issues of inequality and reform, Trump galvanizes support by speaking directly to discomfort over unequal economic outcomes. This historical parallel underscores a recurring theme in American politics: the tension between reformist impulses and the realities of economic disparity.

As the election draws nearer, the distinct economic narratives offered by Trump and Clinton will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping voter sentiment. Trump's focus on reclaiming lost jobs and undoing the impacts of globalization fulfills a need for reassurance among those who feel sidelined in an unpredictable economy. Meanwhile, Clinton’s approach, rooted in optimism and collective growth, seeks to illuminate the possibilities that come from shared prosperity.

However, skepticism surrounding the effectiveness of zero-sum approaches in ushering in widespread economic prosperity remains. While Trump’s philosophy may resonate with a segment of the populace, its limitations in addressing the broader economic challenges could inhibit holistic recovery. Ultimately, economic policies that embrace the complexities of growth, recognizing the potential for collective advancement without necessitating individual loss, may forge a more resilient path forward.

The 2016 election stands as a critical juncture, illuminating two divergent paths regarding America's economic future. Voters must navigate a landscape filled with contrasting visions: one rooted in the dichotomy of winners and losers, and another that holds the promise of shared prosperity. As the final votes are cast, the direction chosen will not only shape the future of the economy but may also redefine the underlying social contract that binds Americans together. The pressing question remains: Can a new approach to economic growth emerge that honors both individual aspirations and collective advancement? Only time will tell as this election cycle unfolds.",72.0,55.0,1571.0,1.3333333333333333,0.04583068109484405,1103.0,1.3095238095238095,0.04986400725294651
Real_13-Webpage,"President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill, Setting Up Showdown With Congress","President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

“I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message.

“I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”

The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.

Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.

The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.

If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.

Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.

""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.

""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.""

But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks.

In a significant move that has sparked a heated debate, President Barack Obama has exercised his veto power over the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), a piece of legislation that would allow the survivors of the September 11 attacks and victims' families to sue the Saudi government. This decision has drawn mixed reactions, particularly from those deeply affected by the attacks who seek accountability and justice.

In his veto message, President Obama expressed heartfelt sympathy for the victims and their families, acknowledging their enduring quest for justice. However, he raised concerns about the possible ramifications of the legislation, specifically the removal of sovereign immunity for foreign governments. The President argued that JASTA could expose U.S. military and government personnel to lawsuits from other countries, potentially leading to retaliatory legal actions.

The veto comes in the wake of Congress's overwhelming approval of the legislation, which passed both the House and Senate unanimously. This pivotal moment sets the stage for a potential veto override, marking the first time during Obama’s presidency that he faces such a scenario. This timing is notable, as it occurs late in his second term while his approval ratings remain relatively high.

If enacted, JASTA would represent a significant shift in how the United States approaches accountability related to terrorism. It would provide a legal pathway for victims of terrorism to seek redress against foreign governments, a move that supporters argue is essential in obtaining justice for those whose lives were irrevocably changed on 9/11. However, critics warn of the unforeseen consequences such legislation could unleash on international relations and the security personnel who serve the United States around the world.

The White House's rationale for the veto has fueled criticism from many families of 9/11 victims, who feel let down by the administration's position. These families have long advocated for greater accountability and have expressed their frustration over what they perceive as a lack of action against those complicit in the attacks, even hinting at connections to foreign governments such as Saudi Arabia. This legislation, despite its controversial nature, had become a beacon of hope for many, representing a chance to hold those they believe are responsible accountable for their actions.

Saudi Arabia, for its part, has vocally opposed JASTA, firmly denying any involvement in the 9/11 attacks. The Kingdom has contended that the passage of such legislation would be unjust and harmful to U.S.-Saudi relations. This opposition further complicates an already fraught geopolitical landscape, as U.S. officials continue to navigate complex diplomatic ties.

In the wake of the veto, the administration is reportedly working to rally sufficient Democratic support in an effort to thwart the possible override of JASTA. A successful override would require a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House, a challenging prospect given the strong bipartisan support the measure has received so far.

As the political implications of this veto unfold, Hilary Clinton, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, has indicated her support for JASTA, pledging that she would advocate for the legislation if elected president. This potential backing further illustrates the contentious divide surrounding the issue, as various political figures and constituencies weigh the competing claims of justice and international diplomacy.

The future of JASTA remains uncertain. As families continue to seek closure, the battle over this legislation epitomizes the ongoing struggle to balance the ideals of justice against the complexities of global relations and national security.",-7.0,5.0,550.0,-0.4375,-0.012727272727272728,651.0,0.21739130434782608,0.007680491551459293

There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.

The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.

It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474473199000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUv7x5bXV4,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/riot.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice.

In a tense display of civil unrest, a protest organized by Black Lives Matter activists erupted on a highway in North Carolina, culminating in violent confrontations with motorists and significant disruption to public safety. The demonstrations followed the recent shooting of a Black man on the same highway, igniting fervent anger and calls for justice among activists. 

As tensions reached a boiling point, protesters engaged in hostile actions, including throwing rocks at vehicles passing through the area. This aggressive behavior significantly raised concerns about public safety and the impact of such protests on community relations. Witnesses described a chaotic scene where automobiles were targets of protester frustration, transforming the highway into a battleground rather than a venue for peaceful expression.

One particularly alarming incident involved a female truck driver who found herself ambushed while navigating the expressed protests. Trapped in her vehicle, she experienced a harrowing ordeal as protesters looted her cargo and subsequently set it ablaze. Desperate for assistance, the driver called the police, but reports indicate a lack of timely response, leaving her vulnerable. A media helicopter was present, capturing footage of the unsettling events, which further highlighted the urgency and danger of the situation.

The fallout from the protest has been significant, as authorities reported that 16 police officers sustained injuries during the clashes. The highway was ultimately shut down in response to the escalating violence, delineating a clear boundary between valid public outcry and actions that put lives at risk.

Critics of the protest's violent manifestation argue that such behavior does not advance the cause of racial equality and justice. The destructive actions witnessed on the highway are seen as a betrayal of the nonviolent principles championed by historical civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. Rather than fostering dialogue and understanding, these confrontations appear to breed further division and exacerbate racial tensions within the community.

The narrative surrounding the incident raises profound questions about the effectiveness of the Black Lives Matter movement's current strategies. Critics contend that the movement's recent emphasis on anger and victimhood detracts from its original mission of advocating for constructive dialogue and positive change. Instead of channeling frustrations into impactful discussions, some argue that these confrontations foster a climate of animosity rather than healing.

As communities reflect on the events that transpired on the North Carolina highway, the challenges of advocating for justice in the face of violence loom large. The necessity for finding a balance between passionate advocacy and peaceful protest is increasingly crucial. Stakeholders from all sides are called to consider the consequences of their actions and the long-term implications those actions may have on the pursuit of justice and equality.

In light of the violence that erupted during this protest, many hope for a shift back to the ideals of nonviolent resistance and reconciling differences through dialogue. Understanding, empathy, and peaceful expression remain pivotal for progressing toward a society firmly rooted in equality for all. The lessons learned from this chaotic protest could serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a commitment to peaceful advocacy, an essential component in the ongoing struggle for civil rights.",-44.0,-53.0,572.0,-1.6296296296296295,-0.07692307692307693,578.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.09169550173010381
Real_15-Webpage,10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.

The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.

Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:

1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.

When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.

Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.”

He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.

2. Personal Attacks Came Early

Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker.

Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics.

“For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.

3. Trading Barbs Over Trade

Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.

“And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said.

Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”

Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.”

“Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said.

Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”

4. Trump Asks ‘Why Not’ Blame All the World’s Problems on Clinton

Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.”

Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?”

Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“

Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""

5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns

Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.

“I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.

Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said.

“I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?

“Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.

6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage

Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.

At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate.

Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015.

“Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”

7. Clinton Defends Being ‘Prepared’ When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail

Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff.

""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.”

Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.

8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion

Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.

“Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said.

Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.”

“They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal.

Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.

9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope

Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.

“I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”

Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.”

The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?""

Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.”

Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”

10. Sparring Over Stamina

Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.”

""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.”

Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.

""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said.

She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:

On the evening of September 26, 2016, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump took to the stage at Hofstra University in New York for their highly anticipated first general election debate. With a substantial viewership expected, this event marked a pivotal moment in the lead-up to the presidential election, as both candidates sought to sway undecided voters and solidify their bases.

As the debate commenced, Clinton and Trump exchanged a courteous handshake, accompanied by light banter that initially set a seemingly amiable tone. However, beneath the surface, the tension was palpable, hinting at the fierce exchanges that would follow as the candidates delved into critical issues facing the nation.

One of the key points of contention revolved around Trump’s business history. Clinton launched the first significant attack of the night, highlighting Trump’s claim of self-made success while revealing that he had borrowed a substantial $14 million from his father to kickstart his career. In response, Trump defended his business acumen, asserting that he had transformed a relatively modest loan into a thriving enterprise. This exchange epitomized the stark contrasts between the candidates’ narratives: Clinton emphasizing a measured and critical approach to governance versus Trump’s portrayal of entrepreneurial success and independence.

The debate soon turned heated as the candidates clashed over the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Trump accused Clinton of supporting the trade deal, suggesting that her previous endorsement revealed a lack of commitment to American workers. Clinton countered by acknowledging her earlier stance but pointed out her shift in position following negotiations, asserting that her evolved view better reflected the interests of the American populace. This back-and-forth illuminated the candidates' differing approaches to global trade and economic policy, highlighting the complexities that resonate with voters concerned about the impact of trade deals on domestic jobs.

In a moment of levity amidst the heated discourse, Trump jestingly remarked that he might eventually be blamed for “all of the world’s problems.” Clinton seized upon the opportunity toinfuse humor into the discussion, quipping about the absurdity of placing such blame on one individual. This exchange served to momentarily diffuse the tension, yet it also underscored the candidates' contrasting styles: Trump’s tendency to provoke with bold statements against Clinton’s strategic use of humor to navigate confrontational situations.

As the debate progressed, the issue of Trump’s unreleased tax returns surfaced, with Clinton directly questioning his motives for withholding this financial information from the public. She argued that transparency is crucial for public trust, suggesting the potential for undisclosed issues within his financial history. Rather than addressing the question directly, Trump deflected criticism by pivoting to Clinton’s email controversy, which he has frequently used to question her credibility and reliability as a candidate. This tactic exemplified Trump’s campaign style—an inclination to redirect criticism rather than thoroughly engage with the issues at hand.

The discussion then turned to the birther controversy, a topic Trump had previously championed. Addressing his past insistence on President Obama’s birthplace, Trump claimed that he was ultimately satisfied once the birth certificate was released. This acknowledgment marked a significant moment for Trump, as he sought to distance himself from the divisive rhetoric that had characterized his approach to this issue for years. Clinton, however, aimed to frame this admission within the broader context of racism and divisiveness, emphasizing the impact of such rhetoric on national unity.

In the face of Trump’s criticism regarding her campaign schedule, Clinton defended her extensive preparation for the debate. She explained that her focus had always been on equipping herself to fulfill the responsibilities of the presidency. In contrast, Trump suggested that a more vigorous campaign strategy on her part might have better served her candidacy. This exchange raised questions about the nature of campaigning and the implications of preparation on a candidate’s ability to govern effectively.

Turning to domestic policies, the candidates discussed the contentious stop-and-frisk policy, with Trump endorsing its effectiveness in enhancing public safety in New York City. Clinton, however, countered this stance by articulating the policy's disproportionate impact on communities of color, indicating a need for more equitable approaches to law enforcement. This dialogue reinforced the core divide between the candidates, with Trump advocating for strong safety measures while Clinton stressed the importance of justice and equality.

As the debate neared its conclusion, Trump confronted challenges regarding his position on the Iraq War. Despite evidence to the contrary, he maintained that he had never supported the invasion, an assertion that drew skepticism from many observers. Clinton pointed out the historical context, suggesting that the reconstruction of events was at odds with the facts. This moment encapsulated the broader debate over foreign policy and military engagement, emphasizing the candidates' fundamentally different perspectives and the implications these differences held for the electorate.

The concluding moments of the debate focused on a discussion of stamina, with Trump questioning Clinton’s vigor and readiness to take on the demands of the presidency. Clinton countered effectively by pointing to her extensive diplomatic experience and resilience, particularly in the face of attacks on her character and abilities. She also reminded viewers of derogatory remarks Trump had made about women, emphasizing her capability as both a leader and a representative of women’s rights. This strategic pivot demonstrated Clinton's intent to frame her campaign not only in terms of policy positions but also in the context of personal integrity and respect for all citizens.

As the debate came to a close, both candidates stood firm in their respective positions, embodying the deep ideological rifts that characterize the current political landscape. With key issues laid bare before the American public, the Hofstra University debate marked an essential milestone in the 2016 presidential election, illustrating the significant choices facing voters in the forthcoming election. 

The high viewership of the debate underscored the nation's interest in the candidates’ contrasting visions for the future of the United States. For many, the evening represented more than just a political contest; it was a reflection of the broader societal tensions and aspirations intertwined with this pivotal election. As both candidates prepared for the road ahead, the implications of their exchanges weighed heavily on the political discourse leading up to voting day. 

In a country deeply divided yet ultimately invested in the democratic process, the Hofstra University debate not only showcased the candidates' viewpoints but also illuminated the challenges that lie ahead as America grapples with its national identity, policy priorities, and the quest for leadership that reflects the values of its diverse citizenry. The journey toward the election would undoubtedly continue to evolve, shaped by the foundational discussions initiated during this memorable debate.",50.0,32.0,2076.0,0.6024096385542169,0.024084778420038536,1254.0,0.7272727272727273,0.025518341307814992
Real_16-Webpage,Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

“I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

“It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

“Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",http://abcn.ws/2cTj7ap,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"More Michael,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting3_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting1_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting2_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_12x5_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939,"{""fb_title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""description"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@MichaelEHayden"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:03:26"", ""keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter, us news, national news, local news"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter""}","- Peaceful protesters attended Charlotte's first city council meeting since the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott.

Charlotte, NC – A powerful wave of emotion swept through Charlotte's city council meeting on Wednesday as peaceful protesters gathered to voice their concerns in the wake of the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. This marked the first council meeting since the tragic incident, and it became a platform for community members to express their frustrations around police violence.

Over 50 speakers took to the microphone, sharing stories of pain and loss, focusing on the need for accountability in law enforcement. Among the standout voices was Zianna Oliphant, a poignant young girl whose heartfelt testimony resonated strongly with many in the room. Oliphant shed light on the intense emotional toll that police shootings exact on children, saying, “I shouldn’t have to bury my parents.” Her remarks referenced Scott, who was a father to seven children, highlighting the devastating impact of his death not just on the immediate family, but on the larger community.

The young speaker lamented the systemic grief that permeates the black community, scrutinizing the cycles of loss that families endure. “We shouldn’t have to be afraid of the people who are supposed to protect us,” she said, encapsulating the fears and anxieties felt by many residents who have witnessed violence unfold in their neighborhoods.

The protests in Charlotte have transformed in scale and intensity since the announcement of Scott's shooting, which ignited passionate activism among residents. While many demonstrators have engaged in peaceful protests, the situation escalated as tensions flared earlier in the week. Police responded to aggressive actions from demonstrators with tear gas and rubber bullets, igniting a flurry of conflict that included blocked highways and confrontations with law enforcement.

Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts took to the stage during the city council meeting, urging attendees to maintain decorum amid rising unrest. Many protesters, however, directed their criticism toward her and Police Chief Kerr Putney for their handling of the situation surrounding Scott's shooting. The charged atmosphere in the council chamber reflected the community's urgency for change and answers.

Following the formal proceedings, over 20 protesters remained in the lobby, demanding the release of the full video footage capturing the events leading up to Scott’s shooting. Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, reiterated the demand for transparency, stating, “We need to see the full video. We deserve the truth.” Despite some footage being released by Chief Putney, critical questions remain. Community members are left wondering whether Scott posed a legitimate threat by having or brandishing a weapon at the time, but no definitive evidence has emerged to clarify the circumstances around the shooting.

As tensions between the police and community members continue to simmer, the desire for accountability is mounting. Protesters assert that their voices will not be silenced until meaningful change is enacted. The discussions and demonstrations in Charlotte mirror a broader national conversation about policing and racial justice, reverberating with calls for an end to violence and a commitment to community healing.

Charlotte’s first city council meeting after the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott served as a microcosm of a community grappling with grief and anger. With poignant voices like that of young Zianna Oliphant cutting through the noise, the city is at a crucial crossroads. As community leaders and citizens grapple with the painful legacy of violence, the path toward understanding and harmony remains to be charted.",-57.0,-35.0,570.0,-2.28,-0.1,642.0,-1.5217391304347827,-0.05451713395638629

Real_18-Webpage,Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night’s big debate: Don’t let Donald Trump get away with it.

And Trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.”

The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.”

“The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,” Silver tweeted.

During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.

“We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told “CBS This Morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, “that that simply be checked.”

“The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.

But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump’s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he’s a Democrat and the system is “very unfair.” The “NBC Nightly News” anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.

“I don’t know that he knew what Lester Holt’s voter registration was,” said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. “He didn’t lie,” Conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.”

In a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, Monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn’t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.

But Clinton’s campaign has beat up on Holt’s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. “In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” Janet Brown, the commission’s executive director, told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

For her part, Clinton won’t let Trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn’t, either.

“There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.”

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.

“I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “You can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but I don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.”

Trump’s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp’s preparation for two Trumps.

“We don’t want Donald Trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We’re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” Mook told NBC’s “Today.”

Asked about Clinton’s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that “it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.”

But Conway shot down the notion that there’s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that “Overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and Conway joined the pile-on.

“He’s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,” Conway said. “And that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.”

After Mook warned against “a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” Conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.”

“I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.”

Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.

“I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.

“What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,” Conway said. “Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.”

Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance.

“So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself — and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.

""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""

As the countdown to the upcoming presidential debate draws near, tensions are mounting between the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The stakes couldn’t be higher in what is shaping up to be a crucial showdown in an increasingly tight race for the presidency.

Clinton's campaign has made it clear that they are taking a stand against what they perceive as Donald Trump's continued distortion of facts. They assert that Trump should not be allowed to manipulate the truth during the debate, a position that has been amplified by Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook. Mook has requested that moderator Lester Holt be proactive in fact-checking Trump in real time, arguing that it is necessary to combat the misinformation that Trump has disseminated throughout the campaign.

On the flip side, the Trump campaign has expressed strong criticism towards the media while also accusing Clinton's team of attempting to manipulate the debate rules to her advantage. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has come to Trump's defense regarding his concerns over Holt's potential bias, dismissing the request for real-time fact-checking as an unjust maneuver by Clinton's team.

The latest polls indicate that the presidential race is tighter than ever, with Trump gaining on Clinton, leading many analysts to predict a ""dead heat"" heading into the debate. This climate of competition has amplified the scrutiny on both candidates, with expectations high for their respective performances on the debate stage.

Amid this charged atmosphere, Clinton's strategy appears centered around countering Trump's frequent misstatements and falsehoods. The campaign argues that Holt must address these inaccuracies during the debate to ensure that voters are not misled. Clinton has aimed to project an image of preparedness and authenticity, contrasting sharply with Trump's debate style, which has often been characterized by a lack of pre-planned responses. While Clinton's approach may come off as overly scripted to some, it reflects a deliberate strategy to navigate the complexities of the debate landscape.

The Commission on Presidential Debates has weighed in on the matter, noting that it is traditional for moderators to avoid actively fact-checking candidates and instead allow them to discuss each other's accuracy. This historical precedent adds another layer of complexity to the debate, as Clinton's campaign pushes for an evolution in how these events are moderated.

Amidst the flurry of campaign rhetoric, both sides appear to be bracing for differing standards of judgment from the media concerning their candidates' performances. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has echoed sentiments against the necessity of real-time fact-checking, arguing that such measures are unwarranted and could contribute to an unbalanced narrative.

Conway has also expressed concerns about the potential for media coverage to shift focus away from substantive debate issues to gender dynamics, particularly highlighting Trump’s critique of Clinton as being robotic and out of touch with the American public, despite her extensive governmental experience.

As both campaigns navigate a landscape fraught with accusations and strategies, the upcoming debate promises to be a focal point for voters seeking clarity on the differences between the two candidates. With the potential for misinformation at the forefront, the expectations for an engaged and informed debate are higher than ever, as both parties prepare to face off in one of the most pivotal moments of the campaign season. 

As tensions rise and strategies unfold, all eyes will be on the debate stage, where the fate of the election may hinge on how effectively each candidate can present their case to the American public—and how well the moderator can maintain the integrity of the discourse amidst a swirl of competing narratives.",-11.0,-1.0,2057.0,-0.22,-0.0053475935828877,674.0,-0.047619047619047616,-0.001483679525222552
Real_19-Webpage,Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?,"I’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I’m pretty much baffled.

The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: “You’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.

Story Continued Below

Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that’s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”)

Further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).

By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump—bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post—but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump—and he's still standing.

Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history.

The Focus Is on “Moments”—But They’re Not Always The Key

Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:

“Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked Americans ‘are you better off?’ Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.”

These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It’s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “You’ve all become theater critics.”)

But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.

The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.

There Are Three Debates, Not One—And That Can Matter A Whole Lot

One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th—barely a week before the election.

Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That’s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.

Here, I think, is an opening for Clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).

Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo

The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.

“Well,” he said, “they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.”

Judo, however, can cut both ways. There’s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.

“Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.”

Debates Are NOT Decisive

One last note. It’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory.

In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.

Of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. So you’ll probably want to tune in anyway

As the political landscape surrounding the upcoming presidential debates begins to take shape, one author, who has dedicated nearly four decades to analyzing these pivotal moments in American politics, finds themselves grappling with uncertainty. This year, the spotlight shines on Hillary Clinton as she prepares to face off against Donald Trump. While Clinton boasts a wealth of experience, it remains to be seen how she will leverage her strengths in a format that may allow Trump to effectively counter them.

Hillary Clinton's extensive experience in both the political arena and as a former Secretary of State is a significant asset, yet it could potentially be weaponized against her by Trump. His unorthodox approach to debate strategy often involves using what some may describe as ""political judo."" This technique allows Trump to take Clinton’s established qualifications and reverse their meaning, suggesting that her tenure in office may have directly contributed to ongoing national and international issues. An example of this could be pointed to in the increasingly complex situation in the Middle East, where Trump may claim that Clinton's past decisions are at the root of current instability.

Understanding the demographics that play a crucial role in the election, Trump must also present himself as a reasonable candidate to appease college-educated white voters who may harbor skepticism towards him. His ability to package his rhetoric as sensible, particularly when addressing key issues, will be vital in winning over this group and distancing himself from perceptions of extremism.

For Clinton, addressing concerns surrounding her honesty and trustworthiness remains a formidable challenge, especially if Trump adopts a measured and composed demeanor in the debates. Should he manage to do so, the contrast may further exacerbate the scrutiny on Clinton, leading voters to question her integrity in light of Trump’s seemingly candid nature.

Past presidential debates have shown that memorable moments often dominate the discussion, eclipsing the cumulative exchanges that define a candidate's overall success. Historical examples illustrate that significant, impactful exchanges can ultimately sway public opinion. Nonetheless, the results of debates do not invariably infer the overall election outcomes, as various factors come into play beyond the candidates' performance on stage.

The structure of the debate schedule also offers candidates a lifeline, allowing them a chance to recover from any missteps made during earlier exchanges. As seen in different elections, a single poor performance does not define the entirety of a candidate's campaign. This flexibility could be crucial for Clinton should she face any challenges in her initial confrontations with Trump.

In town hall formats, Clinton may have a unique opportunity to forge connections between personal concerns and her policy proposals. Engaging with voters on a more intimate level can be a strength if she effectively communicates how her experiences and policies align with the realities of everyday Americans. This kind of direct engagement may resonate positively with undecided voters who are looking for authenticity and relatability in their candidates.

Nonetheless, both Clinton and Trump have the capacity to utilize political judo against each other, skillfully transforming their opponent’s strengths into apparent weaknesses. This technique adds an unpredictable layer to the debates, creating a dynamic exchange where the tide could shift unexpectedly based on a single remark or gesture.

As in previous elections, it is important to recognize that debates do not always wield the decisive power that many pundits anticipate. Their impacts can be limited and temporary, especially in comparison to more foundational issues that drive voter sentiment, such as economic performance and electoral polarization. These ingrained concerns often weigh more heavily in voters' minds than any one moment from a debate, reminding us that while debates can influence perceptions, they are just one piece of the larger electoral puzzle.

Ultimately, as Clinton prepares for what will undoubtedly be one of the most scrutinized debates of the election season, the key will be to navigate the complexities of the exchange with both poise and authenticity. Should she manage to successfully harness her strengths in a way that counters the political judo employed by Trump, she may just emerge victorious in both the debates and the election itself. The nuances of debate strategy will play a critical role, but foundational issues will undeniably continue to shape the electoral narrative leading up to November. 

In this high-stakes arena, where every word is scrutinized and every moment analyzed, the candidates must be prepared not just for the questions they expect, but for the unexpected quips and clever retorts that characterize modern political discourse. As we approach the debate season, all eyes will be on Clinton and Trump, eager to see how each candidate navigates these formative confrontations in the quest for the presidency.",34.0,46.0,1979.0,0.5151515151515151,0.017180394138453764,879.0,1.5333333333333334,0.05233219567690557

The deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage in the election

Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.

""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.""

The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.

In the wake of recent incidents involving the deaths of African-American men at the hands of police, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has voiced her deep concern, describing the situation as ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable."" Clinton's comments come in response to the killings of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma and Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina, incidents that have reignited conversations around police use of lethal force.

During her remarks, Clinton underscored the critical need for change within law enforcement practices, stating that the ongoing debate surrounding lethal police force demands urgent attention and reform. She emphasized that, while there may be uncertainty surrounding the circumstances of each incident, the overarching reality remains that too many lives have been lost unnecessarily.

Clinton's statements reflect the sentiments echoed in protests across the country, which have been fueled by frustration and anger over police violence. However, she urged the public to channel their emotions in a constructive manner, steering clear of directing their anger towards police officers. This call for reflection seeks to foster dialogue rather than exacerbate tensions between communities and law enforcement.

As the nation grapples with issues of racial injustice and police accountability, Clinton's remarks serve as a reminder of the profound impact that these events have on society as a whole. The former presidential candidate's comments highlight the urgency of addressing systemic issues within policing and the need for a collaborative approach to ensure safety and justice for all citizens.",-27.0,-25.0,304.0,-2.25,-0.08881578947368421,286.0,-2.7777777777777777,-0.08741258741258741

Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton.

“The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?”

“I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.”

Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race.

“He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”

Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential candidate, has voiced his pride in providing voters with an alternative to the major party options available in the upcoming election. Johnson has publicly expressed his belief that a presidency under either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would be fundamentally flawed, urging voters to consider a new path that diverges from the traditional two-party system.

In a time when the political landscape is increasingly polarized, Johnson dismisses concerns that he may act as a spoiler in a close presidential race. Instead, he emphasizes his appeal as a standalone candidate, presenting himself as a viable option for those disenchanted with Clinton and Trump. ""I am offering a first vote rather than a lesser of two evils,"" Johnson stated, underscoring his goal to attract voters seeking genuine alternatives.

Notably, Johnson points out a significant trend among new voters, with half registering as independents. This shift challenges the longstanding dominance of the two-party candidates, suggesting a growing appetite for diverse political representation. 

On the other hand, Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, has attempted to diminish Johnson's potential impact on the race. He highlighted a recent decrease in Johnson's poll numbers, which have reportedly dropped to 5%. Mook suggested that third-party candidates like Johnson are unlikely to significantly alter the dynamics of the head-to-head competition between Clinton and Trump, thereby reassuring supporters of the Democratic frontrunner.

Real_22-Webpage,Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.”

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.”

Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

As the Senate reconvenes, Democrats are spearheading an initiative aimed at increasing transparency for presidential candidates. A proposed bill, introduced by Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), seeks to mandate the disclosure of tax returns by nominees of political parties, enhancing the electorate's ability to scrutinize candidates' financial histories.

Under the terms of the proposed legislation, candidates would be required to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving their party's nomination. This measure aims to bolster accountability and is seen as a response to a growing call for transparency in the political process. In the event of a failure to comply with this requirement, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would be obliged to release the candidate's tax returns after a 30-day grace period, ensuring that voters have access to this critical information before the general election.

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) has expressed optimism that the Senate could soon vote on the bill, reflecting a sense of urgency regarding the issue. The push for transparency is particularly pertinent given the ongoing debates about candidates' financial integrity.

Historical precedents highlight the importance of tax return disclosures in the political arena. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton have set a standard by releasing over 30 years’ worth of their tax returns. In contrast, since the establishment of modern campaign finance norms in 1976, only one candidate—Republican Gerald Ford—has outright refused to release his tax information.

The issue gained significant prominence during the 2012 election cycle when former Senate leader Harry Reid publicly accused Republican nominee Mitt Romney of concealing tax returns. This accusation was later corroborated by revelations about Romney's financial dealings, which confirmed Democratic assertions that he paid minimal, if any, taxes. Such incidents raise concerns about voters' ability to make informed decisions regarding candidates’ financial ethics and responsibilities.

Senator Harry Reid, now the Minority Leader, has continued his outspoken critique of the current political climate, recently labeling former President Donald Trump as “ethically compromised.” This charge adds weight to the argument that greater transparency is crucial for maintaining the integrity of presidential campaigns. The tradition of financial disclosures was originally established by George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, who recognized the necessity for voters to remain informed about their potential leaders’ financial circumstances.

The urgency surrounding the introduction of this bill underscores the belief among many lawmakers that voters deserve comprehensive knowledge regarding Trump's tax information to make educated choices at the ballot box. By recognizing this need, the Senate's move to prioritize transparency speaks to a growing consensus on the importance of openness in political campaigns.

The dialogue surrounding Trump's conduct and financial history has led to calls for greater accountability, with proponents urging citizens to demand congressional action, including potential impeachment. As the Senate deliberates on the bill introduced by Wyden, the implications for the future of electoral transparency remain a hot topic among lawmakers and the public alike.",-9.0,19.0,496.0,-0.6428571428571429,-0.018145161290322582,561.0,1.0,0.0338680926916221
Real_23-Webpage,Dem congressman to IRS: Audit the Trump Foundation,"Story highlights Trump reportedly used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes,"" Sander Levin wrote to the IRS

Washington (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen

The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.

The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.

Real_24-Webpage,Armed Intruders Break in House…Armed Resident Responds – Eagle Rising,"Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun.

The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway.

After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away.

In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.”

Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.”

Atlanta, GA – An early morning home invasion turned into a dramatic confrontation when three armed men broke into a resident's home around 4:00 AM. Fortunately, the homeowner's co-worker, who was present for work purposes, defended herself with a handgun, successfully warding off the intruders.

Surveillance cameras inside the residence captured the tense moments of the incident, which have now become crucial evidence for law enforcement.

Tragically, one of the assailants succumbed to his injuries in the driveway, while the other two managed to escape.

Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.

“They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.”

Story Continued Below

Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.

“I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.”

“Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.”

Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.

""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.

“I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""

While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.

“I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”

Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado.

“I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl.

In the aftermath of a contentious presidential debate, former President Donald Trump has openly criticized the debate’s moderator, Lester Holt, for what he described as an unfair approach to questioning. Trump’s critique focused on Holt’s handling of inquiries directed at him, arguing that the moderator neglected significant controversies surrounding his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.

Trump contended that during the debate, Holt did not sufficiently challenge Clinton on various pressing issues, including her email management, personal scandals, and the widely discussed incident in Benghazi. In a highly charged political atmosphere, the former president asserted that a failure to address these topics represented a significant oversight, especially given their relevance to Clinton’s candidacy.

Reflecting on his overall experience from the debate, Trump assigned Holt a grade of C+. While he recognized some merits in the initial questions that focused on substantive policy issues, he expressed disappointment in the subsequent line of questioning. Specifically, he highlighted that he faced “some hostile questions” regarding his past involvement in a housing discrimination lawsuit and persistent birther claims—topics that he felt were presented in a manner that unfairly targeted him.

The scrutiny directed at Holt was echoed by Trump’s campaign team, which includes key figures such as Vice President Mike Pence and senior advisor Kellyanne Conway. Both Pence and Conway supported Trump’s viewpoint, voicing their belief that serious inquiries about Clinton’s history and controversies were largely ignored during the course of the debate. This shared sentiment among Trump’s allies underscored a concerted effort to shift the focus back onto Clinton and her record as they sought to counter negative narratives surrounding Trump himself.

In a remarkable addition to his post-debate commentary, Trump raised concerns about potential technical issues he experienced during the event. He suggested that his microphone may have been tampered with, implying that these issues could have adversely affected his performance. While he did not provide specific evidence to support this assertion, it highlights the former president's tendency to critique every aspect of his public appearances, especially when he feels that the conditions were not equitable.

As the debate progressed, Clinton tactically provoked Trump towards the end by referencing former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado. This moment appeared to significantly unsettle Trump, who has previously faced backlash over comments he made about Machado during her time as Miss Universe. In his defense, Trump claimed that Machado was a difficult contestant, aiming to downplay any negative implications of his earlier statements. However, the tactic successfully drew Trump into a defensive stance, demonstrating how Clinton strategically navigated the debate to capitalize on Trump’s past remarks.

The exchange around Machado revealed the intense back-and-forth that characterized much of the debate. It accentuated the broader themes of gender dynamics and personal character that were prevalent throughout the campaign. Clinton’s reference not only aimed to question Trump's attitude toward women but also served to illustrate her strategy of positioning herself as a candidate of empathy and inclusivity against Trump’s often combative demeanor.

In conclusion, Trump’s reflections on the debate present a multifaceted narrative where he attempts to position himself as a victim of perceived injustices while simultaneously aiming to redirect scrutiny towards his opponent, Clinton. The debate served as a critical junction in the ongoing campaign, highlighting themes of fairness in media coverage, personal accountability, and the tactical nature of political discourse. As both candidates gear up for future encounters, the implications of this debate will likely continue to resonate, influencing public perceptions as the race progresses toward Election Day.",-41.0,-34.0,1119.0,-1.025,-0.03663985701519214,680.0,-1.4782608695652173,-0.05

In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.

Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.

From the Daily Mail:

National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.

A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.

On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street.

After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.

A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

CHARLOTTE, North Carolina — Protests in Charlotte have intensified further into violence for a second consecutive night in the wake of the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an armed black suspect. The situation prompted North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper to declare a state of emergency, mobilizing the National Guard to help restore order amid ongoing chaos.

The protests, initially sparked by calls for justice over the shooting, took a dangerous turn when a protester was critically injured due to gunfire from another protester. This individual is currently on life support, highlighting the escalating tensions within the demonstration. In addition to the serious injuries from gunfire, reports indicate that multiple individuals suffered injuries throughout the protests, including three additional demonstrators and four police officers, underscoring the dangerous environment that has developed.

The unrest has not only impacted demonstrators but has also extended to members of the press. During live coverage, both a reporter and a cameraman were attacked, showcasing the chaotic atmosphere permeating the protests. A CNN correspondent similarly faced aggression, marking a concerning trend toward hostility against media personnel who are attempting to cover the events.

As the situation deteriorated, numerous businesses in the area, including the renowned NASCAR Hall of Fame, fell victim to vandalism and looting. The violent clashes prompted several major companies to advise their employees to avoid downtown Charlotte, reflecting widespread concerns for personal safety in the area.

In response to the rapidly deteriorating situation, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is reportedly considering the imposition of a curfew aimed at regaining control and restoring order to the city. However, the prospect of a curfew also raises questions about public response, as demonstrations have been fueled by frustrations not only with law enforcement but also with the violence that some activists believe is being enacted by their fellow protesters.

The unrest has grown increasingly complex as some demonstrators themselves expressed frustrations regarding the conduct of others within their ranks. Many are concerned that the violent actions occurring amid peaceful protests could overshadow the original message and objectives of the demonstrations. These sentiments echo the broader unease surrounding civil unrest, especially within a racially charged context.

Following the wounding of a protester, law enforcement officials took further measures to disperse the crowd, deploying flash grenades and tear gas to manage the angry throngs of demonstrators. These actions, however, can often further inflame tensions, resulting in a cycle of violence that exacerbates the already volatile situation.

As Charlotte grapples with the repercussions of the recent events, the growing unrest sparks concerns about increasing civil disorder and potential racial tensions in the community. The tragic incident and its aftermath have illuminated deep-rooted issues, with many citizens feeling a mix of anger, fear, and frustration as they navigate the complexities of the ongoing protests.

The city's leaders now face crucial decisions regarding the balance between maintaining public order and allowing citizens to express their grievances. The deployment of the National Guard serves as a stark indication of the severity of the unrest, with officials hoping to address and de-escalate the violence that has marred what began as a peaceful protest.

As the situation in Charlotte unfolds, citizens, leaders, and observers alike remain watchful, recognizing that the path forward will require careful navigation of community sentiments, safety, and the underlying issues driving this unrest. With the eyes of the nation turned toward Charlotte, dialogues about justice, accountability, and community safety will inevitably continue to shape the narrative in the coming days.

As the city awaits further developments, the collective hope remains that peace can soon return to Charlotte, allowing for a constructive dialogue centered around healing and change, rather than violence and division.",-82.0,-70.0,674.0,-2.484848484848485,-0.12166172106824925,692.0,-2.9166666666666665,-0.10115606936416185

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked Rouhani whether he'd rather work with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. Rouhani said, ""Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.

Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.

Real_28-Webpage,“How Can we LEAD When we Can’t Even Control Our Own Cities?” [VIDEO] – Eagle Rising,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said:

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.

“Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.

“Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?

“We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.

“Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.

“The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.

President Donald Trump delivered a poignant address in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Friday, touching on the escalating unrest across the United States triggered by recent officer-involved shootings. Speaking to a crowd in a city grappling with its own challenges, Trump emphasized a critical message of national unity and the importance of coming together to overcome divisive issues and achieve greatness as a nation.

During his speech, Trump called attention to the necessity of individuals from diverse backgrounds collaborating for the common good. He articulated that respect for the American flag is integral to fostering a shared sense of identity and unity among all citizens. This sentiment underlined his belief that understanding each other's perspectives is essential for addressing the complex problems currently facing the nation.

The president pointed out that the ongoing unrest—most notably seen in cities like Charlotte—has detrimental effects on America's global image as a leader. “What we’re seeing in our cities is not America,” Trump declared, noting that the country’s reputation is being tarnished as it navigates through these turbulent times.

While recognizing the right to peaceful protest as a vital component of democracy, Trump vehemently condemned the accompanying violence and threats to public safety that have sometimes marred these demonstrations. He asserted that every American deserves to live in safe communities, stating firmly that violence against both citizens and law enforcement must cease.

Highlighting the disproportionately negative impact of riots on law-abiding African-American residents, Trump pointed out that these disturbances lead to diminished job opportunities, housing instability, and educational setbacks for these communities. “We must recognize that tolerating lawlessness is not a sign of compassion; instead, we need to focus on safety and the well-being of all citizens,” he stressed, reiterating the consequences of allowing unrest to continue unchecked.

Looking ahead, Trump pledged that his administration would prioritize initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life for peaceful citizens, with a particular focus on aiding African-American families who are striving for a promising future. His administration's vision aims to foster a safer environment where individuals can pursue their dreams free from the constraints of violence and systemic unrest.

Trump's remarks served to underscore both a call to action and a hopeful message for a return to civility in the social fabric of the nation. He concluded by urging citizens to reject violence and foster a culture of respect and safety, emphasizing that a united America is not only a hope but a necessity for the country’s progress.

In the wake of increased tensions and calls for change, President Trump’s speech in Pittsburgh positioned him as a leader advocating for solidarity amidst turmoil, seeking to remind Americans that despite their differences, working together is the pathway to a better, brighter future.",-5.0,21.0,540.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.009259259259259259,521.0,1.3125,0.04030710172744722
Real_29-Webpage,9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him,"""Donald, you’re a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him

Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.

That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father.

Story Continued Below

1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection

In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.”

“The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’”

2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward”

Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.”

“It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said.

3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully”

“Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said . “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.”

4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women”

Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.”

5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky”

In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.”

6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth”

Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.”

7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said

“I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said .

8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer”

Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’

And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.”

9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family

“I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.

Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.

In a move that has left political observers both surprised and intrigued, Senator Ted Cruz officially endorsed Donald Trump roughly two months after facing a barrage of boos at the Republican National Convention for refusing to support the former President. This endorsement follows a tumultuous history marked by personal attacks, open disparagement, and public feuds between the two prominent Republican figures.

The tensions between Cruz and Trump dates back to the 2016 presidential campaign, where both candidates were embroiled in a contentious battle for the GOP nomination. Cruz had been a staunch critic of Trump, shedding light on the former President's intemperate remarks and behavior. Among the notable grievances Cruz held were accusations of personal attacks aimed at his family, with Trump drawing attention for his derogatory comments about Cruz’s wife, Heidi Cruz, and insinuations regarding Cruz’s father. These comments sparked a fierce backlash from Cruz, who accused Trump of being a ""sniveling coward"" after the former President threatened to reveal damaging information about him and his wife.

At the Republican National Convention in July, Cruz made headlines when he took the stage and explicitly refused to endorse Trump. His speech centered around a foundational principle — that he would never support someone who attacks his family. This moment of defiance came amid a tense atmosphere, where Cruz was met with boos from the audience, highlighting the divide among Republican ranks and setting the stage for an unexpected reconciliation in the following months.

Cruz's criticisms didn't stop with personal jabs; they extended to serious allegations regarding Trump's morality and honesty. The Senator speculated that Trump’s tax returns might unveil connections to organized crime, a claim that he used to underline his existing distrust of Trump. Furthermore, he didn’t shy away from calling Trump a ""big, loud New York bully,"" characterizing his behavior as that of ""a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women."" Such comments painted a vivid picture of Cruz’s perception of Trump — one that emphasizes a narrative of insecurity masked by brashness.

In more pointed terms, Cruz labeled Trump a ""pathological liar,"" arguing that the former President has demonstrated an alarming ability to blur the lines between truth and falsehood. Cruz claimed that Trump’s dishonesty was indicative of an ""utterly amoral"" disposition, asserting that the former President could contradict himself without any apparent awareness of the inconsistency. This portrayal of Trump not only captured Cruz's personal disdain but also resonated with a broader concern of credibility within the Republican Party.

Moreover, Cruz's disdain extended to bizarre conspiracy theories that Trump perpetuated. One such instance was Trump’s insinuation that Cruz's father had ties to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy — a theory that Cruz quickly dismissed as ""nuts"" and ""kooky."" Such far-fetched allegations fueled Cruz's determination to stand against Trump during the campaign, reinforcing his stance as a principled warrior against what he viewed as the former President's untenable behavior.

With the backdrop of this clear animosity, Cruz's eventual endorsement of Trump raises questions about ideological consistency and loyalty within the ranks of the Republican Party. Political analysts suggest that Cruz's pivot may signify a strategic maneuver — a calculated effort to align himself with Trump in a bid to ensure political survival in a party that has shifted dramatically toward the former President's brand of populist nationalism.

Cruz, who has often positioned himself as a staunch defender of conservative values, now finds himself in a complicated dance with Trump, whose policies and rhetoric have attracted both fervent supporters and vocal critics. This transition from one of Trump’s harshest critics to an endorser demonstrates the complexities of modern American politics, where loyalty often dances with expediency, and principles can be recalibrated depending on the prevailing political winds.

As Cruz steps out in favor of Trump, it reflects a broader trend in the Republican Party, where figures who once stood against the former President now seek to rally behind him. This has been observed across various factions of the party, leading many to speculate on the implications of such endorsements for the future of the GOP and its ability to unite its members under a common vision.

In conclusion, Ted Cruz's endorsement of Donald Trump encapsulates a remarkable shift in the alliance within the Republican Party, marked by a history of vitriol and personal attacks. While political pragmatism may drive this change, it also raises critical questions regarding the values that underpin party loyalty and the criteria for support among its members. As the political landscape continues to evolve, Cruz’s decision serves not only as a testament to the shifting allegiances in contemporary politics but also as an important chapter in the ongoing narrative of American party dynamics.",-40.0,-15.0,974.0,-1.2903225806451613,-0.04106776180698152,908.0,-0.5357142857142857,-0.016519823788546256

These counties could play an outsize role in the election and offer an instructive example of what the political parties have accomplished. Wake County is the fourth county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties.

Washington (CNN)

Few counties could prove more decisive in this election than Wake County, North Carolina.

A historically competitive county whose fortunes are on the rise, Wake could help deliver Hillary Clinton a win in a key battleground state -- or dash her hopes for the presidency. Simply put, if Clinton performs well in the highly educated research triangle, then election night bodes well for her. If Wake County doesn't come out for Clinton, Donald Trump's path to the White House would grow much clearer.

The county is rapidly expanding, and the influx of new people and industries could reshape the race. Meanwhile, the turmoil across the state in Charlotte after a police officer shot and killed a black man could add another focal point in the election — search data from Google Trends shows Wake County's spiking interest in ""police brutality"" this week.

Keep your eye on Wake County, and take a look at the fundamentals below.

Population

Wake County is fairly representative of the country in terms of race and ethnicity, but it has a more highly educated population, bigger incomes and a better job picture than the rest of the nation.

In the latest installment of CNN’s series ""Critical Counties,"" hosted by John King, Wake County, North Carolina, emerges as a key player in the 2016 presidential election landscape. As the fourth county spotlighted in the series, Wake County's political dynamics and voter sentiment could significantly influence the election's outcome.

Considered a potentially decisive area for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Wake County's electoral performance could be a bellwether for her overall success on election night. A strong showing here would bolster her campaign, while lackluster results could provide a considerable advantage to her Republican opponent, Donald Trump.

Demographically, Wake County boasts a highly educated population, coupled with higher income levels and a network of job opportunities that surpass national averages. These attributes contribute to a unique electoral climate that could sway voters in favor of Clinton, should she resonate with the county's concerns and values.

Moreover, current events in nearby Charlotte are likely to shape voter sentiment in Wake County.

President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

“What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.”

“That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.

The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.

“Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”

In a rare moment that defied an unofficial rule against presidential headgear, President Barack Obama accepted a hat and blanket from Native American leaders during the White House Tribal Nations Conference. This event, which emphasizes the importance of government-to-government relationships between the United States and tribal nations, showcased a symbolic gesture of respect and honor from Native American tribes.

As the president prepared to address the conference, tribal leaders presented him with the items, which he graciously accepted. Obama donned the blanket while a ceremonial song was performed in his honor, embracing the cultural significance of the moment. However, he removed the hat shortly thereafter, acknowledging the delicate balance between tradition and presidential decorum.

Expressing his gratitude for the thoughtful gifts, Obama described the occasion as an ""amazing honor,"" emphasizing the meaningful friendships he has formed throughout his presidency.

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.

“Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.”

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.”

“We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.

Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”

But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.

“I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.

As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

In a recent interview on the ""Steve Harvey Morning Show,"" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the crucial stakes of the upcoming election, suggesting it will shape the course of America for the next 50 years. Speaking passionately about the importance of voter participation, she highlighted a particular focus on the black community, urging all eligible voters not to sit out this pivotal election.

Clinton asserted that “Every issue they care about is at stake,” emphasizing the vital role that voting plays in addressing pressing social concerns. As the election draws near, she impressed upon her audience the significance of the next 50 days, indicating that the snapshot of American democracy presented during this time will have far-reaching consequences.

In addition to motivating voters, Clinton called for collective action, urging individuals to check their registration status to ensure they are prepared to make their voices heard. Her message was undoubtedly interwoven with a sense of urgency, as she echoed sentiments recently shared by President Barack Obama. The former president underscored the notion that vital social issues are on the ballot, making it all the more essential for citizens to engage in the electoral process.

As the election campaign intensifies, Clinton is gearing up for a high-stakes first presidential debate against Donald Trump, anticipating a difficult confrontation. She expressed a commitment to conveying her platform clearly, even amidst the potential for personal insults and attacks from her opponent. This intention highlights her strategy to maintain focus on substantive discussions rather than becoming sidelined by inflammatory rhetoric.

Clinton did not shy away from addressing Trump’s derogatory remarks targeting various demographic groups, including African-Americans, immigrants, Muslims, women, and those with disabilities. By condemning these statements, she aimed to portray a stark contrast between her vision for America and that of her opponent, framing the upcoming election as not only a political contest but a moral one.

In response to Clinton's interview, Trump took to social media, mocking her for taking the day off ahead of the debate. This tweet reflects the contentious atmosphere that has characterized the campaign season, where personal jabs and tactical advantage are often at the forefront of discourse.

As the nation stands on the brink of a significant electoral decision, Clinton's remarks serve as a rallying cry for voter engagement. With time running out before the polls open, her focus on issues affecting marginalized communities highlights the broader implications of the election. Voter turnout, particularly among demographic groups that have historically faced disenfranchisement, will be pivotal.

Ultimately, Clinton's message resonates as a call not just to participate but to understand the gravity of the upcoming election. The choices made in the ballot box this November will undoubtedly influence the shape of America for generations to come, making it imperative for citizens to act decisively in order to uphold the democratic principles they cherish. As the debate approaches, the intensity of the campaign is sure to escalate, with both candidates preparing to make their case to the American people in the coming days.",7.0,13.0,524.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013358778625954198,580.0,0.65,0.022413793103448276

When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps.

This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.

Story Continued Below

So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.

Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.

Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as “another Hitler.” She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.

In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.

That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.

It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin’s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did—an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing Russians,” a doubly illegal act of war.

Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.

***

John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, “Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.” Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.

But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.” Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.”

Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.

“Our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.”

He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. “All this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.”

John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.

The legacy of JFK & RFK is “being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party.”

Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.

Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.

Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.

Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime “existential” threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be “existential” enemy.

There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.

Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.”

Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.

But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.

For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.

And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.

***

So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.

We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.

President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future.

Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.

But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.

Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.

Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “There can be no business as usual with Russia.”

Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.

And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:

Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.

Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.

Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.

This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.

Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.

Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.

Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

In the intricate tapestry of American politics, shifts in allegiance often reflect deep-seated ideological transformations and personal journeys. One such journey is epitomized by an author who has spent decades in the political realm, notably serving under the esteemed presidents John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. Their commitment to progressive values and diplomatic engagement crafted a formative backdrop that would shape this individual’s understanding of what constitutes true American leadership.

However, a notable pivot occurred in the 21st century, particularly evident during the tumultuous 2016 presidential election cycle. The author transitioned away from the Democratic Party, turning their support towards Donald Trump amid a perceived shift towards militarism and interventionism within Democratic policies. As they closely observed the political landscape, their discontent with the party's trajectory became increasingly apparent, particularly in light of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's advocacy for military incursions and her historical role in escalating foreign conflicts.

Critiquing Clinton's position on foreign policy, the author articulated a profound concern over the Democratic agenda that appeared to prioritize military solutions over diplomatic negotiations. They viewed this approach as antithetical to the spirit of the Kennedy administration, which championed peace and collaboration within the international sphere. The contrast was stark—what was once a party rooted in diplomatic engagement now seemed to veer towards a militaristic stance. 

In examining Trump's foreign policy proposals, the author found solace in his willingness to engage diplomatically with key global players such as Russia and China. They argued that this approach was not only necessary but essential in the ongoing fight against terrorism, as it opened the door to cooperation in addressing shared global challenges. While acknowledging Trump's imperfections as a candidate, the author lauded his political courage and his audacity to challenge the prevailing war hawks in Washington, D.C.

The author frequently invoked the memory of the Kennedys, underscoring their commitment to peace and diplomacy. They argued that such values have been overshadowed by contemporary Democratic policies that, in their view, have strayed far from this noble path. This has manifested in a series of military interventions that, according to the author, have wrought widespread destruction both abroad and at home. The author pointedly claimed that these interventions have drained invaluable resources—resources that could otherwise support pressing needs within American society.

The call for urgency in addressing these issues resonated throughout the author's discourse. They argued vehemently for an immediate cessation of unnecessary wars, asserting that focusing on domestic priorities would ultimately lead to a stronger and more secure nation. By redirecting resources and attention away from foreign entanglements, the author envisioned enhanced domestic stability, suggesting that bolstering local police forces and prioritizing security within American borders should take precedence.

Furthermore, the author called for a return to foundational principles that place national interests at the forefront, advocating against the dangers of new Cold Wars and the potential resurgence of a nuclear arms race. Their arguments were underscored by a belief that addressing economic and social issues locally would not only heal divisions but also prevent entanglements in foreign conflicts that have historically proven detrimental to both economic and societal well-being.

In summation, the author emerged as a voice of principled dissent within the contemporary Democratic discourse. Their support of Trump's platform, framed as a commitment to prioritize America's needs first, highlighted a longing to realign with what they deemed historic American values. In a political landscape fraught with division, the author's insights reflected a profound re-examination of loyalty, peace, and national interest—concepts that continue to define the heart of American political ideology. 

As debates about military intervention and diplomacy continue to shape the national conversation, the author's narrative serves as a poignant reminder of the need for principled leadership that truly reflects the aspirations of peace and security both at home and across the globe. They exemplify how political identities can evolve, calling into question whether allegiance to a party should overshadow a commitment to the foundational aims of peace and prosperity that once characterized the Democratic Party.",-120.0,48.0,3840.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.03125,753.0,1.8461538461538463,0.06374501992031872

As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.

Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.

From the Independent Review Journal:

But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:

People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474655224000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer4.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer1.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer2.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer3.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer5.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters."", ""title"": ""NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte - But It Wasn't To Protest The National Anthem... | John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 750, ""identifier"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg"", ""height"": 563}, ""url"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""always"", ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 1631890973779575, ""pages"": 389658314427637}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Black Lives Matter"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-23T14:27:04-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/terresamonroe""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- NC State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters, contrasting previous protests against police actions.

In a poignant display of faith and solidarity, North Carolina State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray shortly before facing protesters, a striking departure from the intense climate of previous protests against police actions. This act of devotion came in light of ongoing tensions following the recent officer-involved shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has rekindled spirited discussions and public demonstrations in Charlotte and other cities like Tulsa.

The moment was captured in a powerful photograph shared by the North Carolina Troopers Association, rapidly gaining viral attention on social media. The image underscores a faith-focused approach adopted by the troopers, emphasizing the importance of spiritual reflection and fellowship in times of unrest. This sentiment resonates strongly amidst the backdrop of heightened emotions, offering a stark contrast to the chaos that has defined many recent protests.

Citizens across Charlotte and Memphis have also engaged in kneeling and prayer, symbolizing a collective yearning for peace despite the existing frictions between communities and law enforcement. These acts serve as reminders of the power of unity and shared belief amidst strife.

However, the article critiques radical elements within the protest movements, labeling those who instigate violence as ""useful idiots,"" suggesting an agenda that undermines the genuine voices calling for reform. The implication of external influences, including supposed connections to Marxist ideologies, serves to frame a narrative where acts of division threaten to overshadow the fundamental messages of justice and accountability. 

In contrast, the presence of the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team has been touted as a beacon of hope, reinforcing a message of faith over discord. This initiative aims to provide comfort during challenging times, fostering an environment conducive to dialogue rather than division. The initiative has been well-received and appreciated, highlighting a path toward reconciliation drawn from shared faith and compassion.

As the conversation around police actions and community relations continues to evolve, the article posits that movements like Black Lives Matter have, unfortunately, been caught in a narrative of violence. This perspective signifies a disconnect between the fundamental revelations of justice sought by many and the actions taken by a fraction of participants that may distort the overarching message. The prayerful presence of both law enforcement and citizens is presented as a hopeful counter-narrative to these violent expressions, signaling a desire to find common ground through faith and a commitment to non-violence.

As the situation develops in Charlotte and across the nation, the juxtaposition of prayerful moments with the backdrop of turmoil suggests a complex tapestry of community responses to deeply entrenched issues. The call for unity through faith, as exemplified by the troopers and supporting citizens, stands in stark relief against the backdrop of more radical expressions that threaten to derail constructive dialogue and understanding.

Ultimately, the prayer gathering initiated by the NC State Troopers represents a significant moment of reflection and commitment to peace, encouraging individuals from all walks of life to consider the power of faith-driven actions amid the challenges of social unrest. Whether it's through kneeling in prayer or standing in solidarity, the hope emerges that healing and understanding can pave the way forward, regardless of the divisive rhetoric that often accompanies discussions of race, policing, and justice.",3.0,32.0,580.0,0.1,0.005172413793103448,597.0,1.6842105263157894,0.05360134003350084

The two scuffled afterward, and the protester was taken to a hospital for stitches

(CNN) Kevin Johnson -- the NBA star-turned-Sacramento mayor -- was pied in the face by a man at a charity dinner Wednesday night at the high school he once attended.

But the pie-thrower appeared to get the worst of it.

Sean Thompson, 32, approached the mayor, pulled a pie out of the bag and shoving it in his face -- setting off a short scuffle, in which Johnson punched Thompson in the face several times, according to witnesses descriptions of the scuffle in local media reports

""There was an altercation that occurred after he got the pie in the face,"" Sgt. Bryce Heinlein, a Sacramento police spokesman, told CNN.

Real_35-Webpage,Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games.

Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.

Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.

""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.

While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.

During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!""

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

This act of protest, which took place on September 18 during a game against the Netherlands, was intended to highlight issues of injustice and oppression in the United States. Rapinoe's demonstration is inspired by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who famously initiated a movement addressing police brutality and racial prejudice.

The implications of Rapinoe’s actions have stirred considerable debate within the realm of sports. U.S. Soccer has expressed its disapproval, stating that players and coaches are expected to stand during the anthem as a sign of respect for the flag. The organization’s response to Rapinoe's kneeling has been one of anger, emphasizing that her actions contradict the values upheld by U.S. Soccer.

As the fallout from her protest unfolds, Rapinoe has already encountered backlash from some fans during games. Notably, one spectator was heard shouting, ""Stand up!"" in response to her kneeling. This reaction reflects the divided opinions surrounding her demonstration and signals potential challenges she may continue to face from fans who view her actions as disrespectful.

Despite the possibility of facing disciplinary measures, Rapinoe has expressed her intent to persist with her protest. She aims to refine her method of advocacy moving forward, indicating that she is committed to raising awareness about social justice issues, regardless of the consequences that may arise from her actions on the field.

This situation places Rapinoe at the intersection of her sporting career and her fervent commitment to activism, a position that has become increasingly common in professional sports. As athletes use their platforms to advocate for change, the responses from sports organizations, fans, and the media will likely influence future demonstrations and public discourse on issues of equality and justice.

In the coming months, it will be crucial to monitor Rapinoe’s actions and any potential disciplinary actions taken by U.S. Soccer. The outcome may serve to shape how protests are approached in the realm of sports, as well as the ongoing conversation around athletes’ rights to free expression. Ultimately, Rapinoe’s decision to kneel is emblematic of a larger movement that invites both support and criticism from various segments of society.",0.0,-1.0,421.0,0.0,0.0,418.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.0023923444976076554

It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed.

Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing.

Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.

Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.”

Below is the offending post:

“I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??”

After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.

Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people.

In a recent social media stir, Brody Jenner, the son of Caitlyn Jenner and Linda Thompson, made headlines for his comments regarding police shootings that have ignited a fierce debate online. Jenner's tweets emphasized the notion that not every incident involving law enforcement is tied to racial dynamics. Expressing his view that ""All Lives Matter,"" Jenner offered a perspective that diverged sharply from prevalent discussions surrounding police interactions, especially in the wake of high-profile cases that have drawn national attention.

The reality television star's remarks quickly became a focal point for criticism, particularly from those who identify as liberal. Social media platforms were ablaze with reactions, as users expressed their disappointment and discontent regarding Jenner's stance. This backlash underscores the deeply polarized nature of contemporary discourse around issues of race and law enforcement, as individuals grapple with differing interpretations of the struggles faced in society.

Brody Jenner's frustration appeared to stem from what he perceives as a skewed representation of events in the media. He underscored the necessity of following police instructions, a sentiment that he believes transcends racial boundaries. His comments raise pertinent questions about individual behavior during tense police encounters, as he challenged the logic behind actions such as exiting a vehicle armed or failing to communicate properly with law enforcement officers.

In the wake of the backlash, Jenner further fueled the controversy with additional posts that continued to provoke those on the left. His follow-up comments only escalated tensions among his critics, who deemed his sentiments overly simplistic and insensitive to the complexities surrounding issues of race and police violence. This sparked intense conversations about the implications of his statements and the broader societal context in which they were made.

As the digital debate rages on, it is evident that Jenner's remarks have struck a chord, illustrating the sensitivities many individuals feel towards discussions of race relations in America. The backlash he has encountered highlights how quickly opinions can divide and how individuals may interpret the same comment in vastly different ways based on their political affiliations.

The situation has led to contemplations around the nature of public discourse, particularly how individuals who express dissenting opinions are labeled and criticized. Jenner's comments have magnified perceptions that liberals can be overly sensitive and rapid to take offense, a characterization that continues to drive divisions in online and offline conversations.

Through this unfolding story, Brody Jenner finds himself at the center of a contentious dialogue that emphasizes the complexities of race, police interactions, and the challenging nature of public discourse in today's society. As conversations evolve, the implications of Jenner's comments may resonate well beyond Twitter, prompting a reevaluation of how society addresses these critical issues.",-17.0,-30.0,476.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.03571428571428571,510.0,-1.6666666666666667,-0.058823529411764705

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.”

Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past.

Story Continued Below

“Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.”

The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].”

Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.”

“I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”

In a passionate critique, Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, lambasted former President Donald Trump for his continued refusal to apologize for his involvement in the controversial “birther” movement, which questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama. Speaking candidly about the enduring implications of Trump’s actions, Brazile described the matter as a “wound that won’t heal,” drawing attention to the painful history of race relations in America.

Brazile’s remarks come in light of her recent visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. During her tour, she reflected on the struggles faced by her ancestors, who were enslaved and denied the basic rights of citizenship, including the ability to obtain documentation that affirmed their identity. This personal connection to the historical narrative of racial oppression underscored her call for Trump to take responsibility for his role in perpetuating divisive rhetoric.

“History cannot be rewritten,” Brazile stated emphatically, referring to the emotional trauma that has been resurrected every time Trump has questioned Obama’s legitimacy as the nation’s first black president. Brazile pointed out that Trump's cavalier treatment of the issue showcases a lack of understanding—or perhaps a deliberate disregard—for the lasting effects that racism has had on the country.

During a recent presidential debate, Trump was confronted about his longstanding promotion of the birther conspiracy. In his defense, he deflected blame to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her campaign, asserting that they were the ones who had originally raised the question about Obama's birthplace. Furthermore, Trump claimed credit for pressuring Obama to release his birth certificate, a document that confirmed his citizenship.

Brazile expressed her skepticism regarding any expected apology from Trump, citing past behavior that demonstrated his unwillingness to acknowledge wrongdoing. ""It is unlikely that we will ever hear him admit he is wrong,"" she remarked, criticizing the former president for bringing up the issue repeatedly instead of allowing a collective healing. 

The implications of Trump’s remarks extend far beyond mere political rivalries, Brazile argued. She pointed out that conversations surrounding his actions continue to stir deep-seated racial pain and animus throughout the nation. By refusing to apologize, Trump not only disregards the suffering associated with these historical injustices but also perpetuates an environment where racial discourse remains contentious.

Brazile's comments resonate particularly at a time when the nation grapples with its complex history of race relations. Her call for accountability is a reminder that the components of our political landscape are intertwined with issues of identity, legacy, and humanity. The birther movement serves not just as a topic of political debate, but as a symbol of the racial division that endures in American society. 

As Brazile put it, Trump’s failure to apologize reflects a broader failure to acknowledge the evolution of racial consciousness in the United States. “We must confront the truths of our past, as painful as they may be, to move forward toward a more unified future,” she urged. Whether Trump chooses to heed these calls remains uncertain, but Brazile’s poignant critique underscores a critical moment for reflection and necessary dialogue in the pursuit of racial justice and reconciliation.",-17.0,-48.0,540.0,-1.0,-0.03148148148148148,611.0,-2.2857142857142856,-0.07855973813420622
Real_38-Webpage,US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike,"(CNN) The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.

Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials.

That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.

Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.

But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

This tragic incident involved aircraft from the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Australia. Initial assessments indicate that the bombing may have occurred due to personnel not wearing military uniforms and lacking standard military weapons, leading some US military officials to suggest that the targeted individuals could have been Syrian military prisoners.

The UK Ministry of Defence confirmed that drones were used in the strike. As of now, the US has not reached a final conclusion regarding the identity of those who were struck.

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

“This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.”

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

“If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.”

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

“That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.”

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

At the recent Emmy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel seized the opportunity to address the political climate in the United States, taking particular aim at former President Donald Trump and his supporters in a night filled with humor and sharp commentary.

Kimmel opened the ceremony with a light-hearted take on Hollywood's elite, humorously navigating the complexities of diversity among the nominees. His sarcastic remarks about the Emmys' efforts to embrace diverse representation seemed to suggest that the Oscars might be experiencing a tinge of envy over the Emmys' progress, reflecting the ongoing discussions surrounding inclusivity in the entertainment industry.

As the night progressed, Kimmel's satire took a pointed turn as he delved into Trump's rise to prominence. He quipped that Trump had garnered fame through television, insinuating that without that platform, the former president may never have embarked on a political career. This commentary was underscored by Kimmel's playful reference to Melania Trump, which drew laughs from the audience, further framing the former first lady in a light, comedic context.

Kimmel's critique did not stop there; he placed a significant portion of the blame for Trump's presidency on Mark Burnett, the creator of the reality show ""Celebrity Apprentice."" In a bold and amusing statement, Kimmel described Burnett as the one responsible for transforming reality TV into what many now experience as reality itself. His remarks highlighted the blurred lines between entertainment and political leadership in contemporary America.

In a particularly comedic twist, Kimmel suggested that if Trump were elected again, Burnett should be the first to be thrown over the wall that Trump often spoke of during his presidency. This jab encapsulated Kimmel's overarching theme of the night – a commentary on the absurdity of reality television merging with serious governance. 

Through humor and satire, Kimmel successfully highlighted issues of celebrity culture, media influence, and the impact of reality television on politics, reminding audiences of the ongoing cultural dialogue around these critical themes.",13.0,23.0,391.0,0.7222222222222222,0.03324808184143223,378.0,1.9166666666666667,0.06084656084656084

Real_41-Webpage,Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business',"During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump’s debate performance Monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.""

Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""

""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'You’re fired.' They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.""

During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way.""

""When you’re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump.

The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart.""

""He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.

""If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord,"" Biden said about the debate. ""What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.""",http://abcn.ws/2d3YEVr,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"Abc News,More Arlette",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382,"{""fb_title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""description"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@arlettesaenz"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:43:23"", ""keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate""}","- Vice President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's debate performance regarding the housing crisis during a rally in Philadelphia at Drexel University.

PHILADELPHIA, PA – Vice President Joe Biden took a strong stance against Donald Trump’s recent debate performance concerning the housing crisis during a rally held at Drexel University. Addressing a crowd of supporters, Biden articulated his disbelief at Trump’s remarks suggesting that it was favorable business to see the housing market fail, labeling such a viewpoint as fundamentally misguided.

Biden, drawing on his extensive experience in government, underscored the importance of a moral compass in leadership, stating that every president he has worked alongside, including Republican leaders, shared a commitment to American principles and basic rights. In a poignant moment, he questioned whether former President Ronald Reagan would ever entertain the notion that it was good business to exploit the suffering of everyday Americans, emphasizing that such values should transcend partisan politics.

The Vice President expressed deep concern regarding Trump's perception of the American people and the implications of his business philosophy, which he viewed as lacking fundamental sensibilities. He pointedly referenced a moment during the debate when Trump audaciously claimed that rooting for a housing collapse is simply part of business. This sentiment, according to Biden, is indicative of a broader cynicism that undermines the very fabric of American society.

Additionally, Biden condemned Trump’s assertion that not paying taxes equates to intelligence, stating that such an attitude not only reflects a disconnect from the realities faced by working citizens but also imposes an unfair burden on those striving to make ends meet. “For families in our country who are struggling, this isn’t a game,” he said, highlighting the injustice inherent in Trump’s philosophy.

As Biden continued to voice his frustrations, he underscored the impact of Trump’s views on the fiscal responsibilities borne by ordinary citizens. He articulated a message of solidarity with those feeling the strain of financial hardships, drawing a sharp contrast between his own values and the perspective espoused by his political opponent.

Ultimately, Biden conveyed a clear and urgent call to action for the voters, asserting that the upcoming election presents a choice that should be evident to all. “This isn’t just about policies; it’s about who we are as a nation and how we treat our neighbors,” he stated passionately. His remarks served as a reminder of the stakes involved in the upcoming election, emphasizing the need for leaders who prioritize the welfare of the American populace over business interests. 

As the rally concluded, Biden’s message resonated deeply, reinforcing the notion that moral leadership is crucial in navigating the complexities of America’s challenges, particularly those related to the housing crisis. The rally energized supporters, fostering a sense of urgency as the election nears.",-5.0,-11.0,453.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.011037527593818985,526.0,-0.6875,-0.02091254752851711
Real_42-Webpage,National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6,"Story highlights Hillary Clinton has a 6-point lead over Donald Trump in a four way race, according to a new poll

Clinton has the edge over Trump on a number of key issues in the poll ahead of the first presidential debate

(CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.

The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.

Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.

Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.

Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament.

Real_43-Webpage,“Public School Forced My Child To,"7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

“Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.”

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

“During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.”

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

“Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.”

It referenced the jihad as,

“a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years.

La Plata High School in Maryland finds itself at the center of controversy after a lawsuit was filed in federal court by John and Melissa Wood, backed by the Thomas More Law Center. The couple accuses the school of indoctrinating students with Islamic teachings, leading to serious allegations regarding how Islamic concepts are integrated into the curriculum.

According to the Woods, the lawsuit outlines various practices they believe violate the constitutional rights of their daughter and potentially others within the school. Among the most striking allegations is that students were subjected to mandatory recitation of the Shahada, the Islamic statement of faith, and instructed to memorize the five pillars of Islam. John Wood has asserted that he faced retribution from school authorities after raising concerns about these practices, claiming he was banished from school property.

Richard Thompson, President of the Thomas More Law Center, echoed the Woods' concerns, stating that the school forced Wood's daughter to recite the Shahada and publicly acknowledge Mohammed as her spiritual leader. This assertion has raised alarms among laypersons, as reciting the Shahada is often interpreted as an act of conversion for non-Muslims, including those of Christian and Jewish faiths.

The lawsuit has not garnered any public comments from officials within Charles County Public Schools, despite mentioning three school officials by name. As the complaint unfolds, it includes claims of inadequate representation of Christianity within the school’s teaching framework. The Woods allege that the instruction provided to students has contained disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope, breeding an environment of discomfort for those practicing the Christian faith.

The notion of discriminatory treatment toward Christianity is underscored in the lawsuit, with legal representatives arguing that such an approach contravenes established Supreme Court precedents concerning religious equality in public education. The Woods maintained that classroom materials hinted at a hierarchy between Muslim beliefs and those of Christians, suggesting a bias in the educational setting. The plaintiffs argue that this is unconstitutional and infringes upon their rights as parents to oversee the moral and religious education of their child.

Additionally, the instruction reportedly emphasized the peaceful nature of Islam while refuting violent interpretations of jihad, presenting an educational perspective that the Woods label as overly favorable toward one religion, while Christianity is allegedly marginalized. The situation raises profound questions about the role of public education in teaching religious principles and how various faiths are represented in the context of a diverse student body.

Allegations detailed in the lawsuit trace back to the 2014-2015 school year, indicating that concerns surrounding the teaching methods at La Plata High School are not recent developments. The case has yet to elicit a response from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) or the Freedom From Religion Foundation, both known for their advocacy on religious freedom issues.

As the situation unfolds in court, stakeholders remain vigilant, with broader implications for religious instruction in public schools at the forefront of this controversial legal battle.",-5.0,-24.0,511.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.009784735812133072,552.0,-1.3333333333333333,-0.043478260869565216

Real_47-Webpage,KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism,"“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can’t I?

In a candid remark that has sparked conversations across social media, rock icon Gene Simmons shared his thoughts on the recent actions of Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the man accused of being behind the NY/NJ bombings. While at an airport security line, Simmons stated that Rahimi should “go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend,” showcasing his characteristic blend of bluntness and humor.

Known primarily as a member of the legendary rock band KISS, Simmons is also recognized for his outspoken views on a range of social issues. When approached by TMZ, the cultural icon didn’t shy away from the contentious topic of Islamic terrorism, suggesting that the need for increased profiling is imperative in addressing such threats. His remarks ignited a mixture of laughter and contemplation, as he noted, “I’d would rather be profiled than harmed.” 

Simmons’ comments also addressed the broader implications of profiling, acknowledging the fears surrounding unfair treatment. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist,” he quipped, attempting to inject some levity into an otherwise serious discussion. His perspective resonates amidst ongoing debates about the balance between security measures and civil liberties.

As the dialogue surrounding terrorism and national security heats up, some have humorously speculated whether Simmons might find a surprising new role in a potential Trump administration, perhaps even as a member of Homeland Security. While it remains unclear what the future holds, Simmons’ outspoken nature and willingness to engage in controversial topics certainly keep him in the public eye.

While reactions to Simmons’ comments have been mixed, one thing is clear: the conversation around profiling, security, and terrorism remains complex and ever-evolving in today’s society. As discussions continue, figures like Simmons help to shine a spotlight on these important issues, encouraging a dialogue that is sure to persist in the years to come.",12.0,-1.0,381.0,0.5714285714285714,0.031496062992125984,370.0,-0.08333333333333333,-0.002702702702702703
Real_48-Webpage,"Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'","(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""

""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""

Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.

Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.

Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.

""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""

""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""

""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""

Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016

In response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.

Danny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.",http://cnn.it/2cQyS4N,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,"Dan Merica,Eugene Scott",http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161118161709-cop-punches-woman-in-face-thumb-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718110446-02-officer-mohamed-noor-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717224427-justine-ruszczyk-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170711043320-georgia-police-beating-jnd-orig-vstop-00000612-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170104090632-north-carolina-school-body-slam-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170720014308-baltimore-pd-body-cam-video-release-02-large-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170626185531-jordan-edwards-roy-oliver-split-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712182221-florida-state-attorney-aramis-ayala-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170818111936-dashcam-video-ohio-violent-arrest-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160707080401-philando-castile-facebook-2-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520225617-georgia-man-tased-death-police-pkg-00012201-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717113139-australian-woman-minneapolis-police-shooting-nr-00000812-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718090944-betsy-hodges-7-18-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712054244-louisiana-couple-police-shooting-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160428084627-baltimore-teen-replica-gun-shot-dnt-00001823-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html,"{""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""author"": ""Eugene Scott and Dan Merica, CNN"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-col,col-controversial-police-incidents-"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Election 2016, US election, Tulsa, shooting, politics, Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable' - CNNPolitics"", ""article"": {""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202""}, ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-21T14:20:33Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced a plan to prevent police-involved shootings.

In a bold move aimed at curbing the alarming trend of police-involved shootings, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, has put forth a multi-faceted initiative designed to foster safer interactions between law enforcement and community members. The announcement comes in the wake of heightened tensions and public outcry following several tragic incidents involving unarmed Black individuals and police officers.

Mook's plan, rooted in a commitment to systemic reform, consists of two primary approaches. The first involves the establishment of national standards for managing police situations. By improving training protocols for officers, Mook hopes to equip them with the skills necessary to handle potentially volatile encounters without resorting to violence. This initiative aims not only to reduce the frequency of police-involved shootings but also to promote accountability within law enforcement agencies.

The second prong of the initiative emphasizes the vital importance of community policing efforts. By strengthening relationships between police departments and minority communities, the plan seeks to rebuild trust that has eroded over the years due to incidents of violence and systemic inequities. Mook's strategy recognizes that the foundation for effective law enforcement lies within the communities they serve, advocating for collaborative approaches to public safety.

Clinton has been vocal about her concerns regarding systemic racism within the context of police interactions. Following the shooting of Terence Crutcher—an unarmed Black man—by police in Tulsa, she expressed her outrage, calling attention to the urgent need for systemic change. Clinton characterized the incident as intolerable and reaffirmed her commitment to addressing implicit bias within the criminal justice system. Her acknowledgment of unequal treatment across different ethnic groups reveals a deep concern for the ongoing struggles faced by minorities within America.

The events in Tulsa mirror broader national tensions, demonstrated by protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, after the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. The demonstrations resulted in injuries to approximately 12 police officers, underscoring the impact of community unrest stemming from police violence. As incidents like these continue to reverberate throughout the nation, Clinton’s proactive approach aims to mitigate such occurrences before they escalate into violence.

In a series of tweets following the Crutcher incident, Clinton expressed her indignation and called for transformational change within the law enforcement framework. She highlighted the presence of honorable police officers while simultaneously emphasizing that systemic racism is a pervasive issue that needs to be urgently addressed. Clinton's recognition of the duality within police departments reflects a nuanced understanding of the challenges facing those who serve and protect while maintaining an unwavering stance against the systemic factors that contribute to violence.

The federal response to these tragic events has been swift, with the Department of Justice and state authorities launching investigations into the shooting of Crutcher. These investigations are crucial in assessing potential civil rights violations and aim to hold accountable any individuals or systems that may have contributed to the tragedy. 

As the national dialogue about policing continues, Mook's announcement represents a concerted effort from the Clinton campaign to not only respond to current events but also to lay the groundwork for lasting reform in law enforcement. The dual focus on improving police training and enhancing community relationships signals a proactive approach to rebuilding trust and ensuring accountability.

Clinton's advocacy for systemic reform reflects a broader societal shift in recognizing the necessity for meaningful changes in how police departments interact with the communities they serve. By addressing these issues head-on, the Clinton campaign is positioning itself at the forefront of a critical conversation that seeks to bridge the divide between law enforcement and the communities that too often feel marginalized and threatened.

With tensions running high across the nation in the wake of these troubling incidents, Mook's strategy, coupled with Clinton's commitment to combating systemic racism, could potentially serve as a model for future progressive reforms aimed at addressing deeply rooted issues within American law enforcement and criminal justice systems.",-5.0,-11.0,656.0,-0.14705882352941177,-0.007621951219512195,716.0,-0.4230769230769231,-0.015363128491620111
Real_49-Webpage,Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked,"Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked

Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager.

Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative.

Story Continued Below

“He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?”

Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.

Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.”

“So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked.

“You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.

In the lead-up to the much-anticipated debate against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, confirmed that Trump is prepared to share details of his plan to combat the Islamic State if prompted during the discussion. Trump has made headlines with his bold promises to ""knock the hell out of ISIS,"" but details surrounding his strategies have remained largely undisclosed.

Conway emphasized that while Trump has a specific plan to defeat ISIS, it is critical to maintain a level of operational security. She criticized Clinton for making elements of her own strategy public on her campaign website, expressing concern that such actions can potentially benefit the enemy by disclosing tactics that should remain confidential.

The campaign manager reiterated that Trump's approach would be transparent enough to inform voters of his intentions without compromising the effectiveness of his military strategy. ""We want to ensure the voters know what to expect from Trump, but we cannot risk giving ISIS an advantage by revealing specific tactics,"" Conway stated.

As the debate draws near, the spotlight will not only be on Trump’s anticipated revelations but also on how he plans to balance transparency with security, a critical component of modern warfare discussions. Voters will be eager to hear how Trump intends to differentiate his strategy from that of his opponent while asserting the importance of keeping sensitive information safeguarded.

Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists.

During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear.

""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.""

""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens.

During a recent visit to New York, President Obama reaffirmed the United States' steadfast commitment to combating ISIS and reassured the nation in the wake of recent acts of violence that have incited fear among Americans. Speaking from a hotel in midtown Manhattan while attending the U.N. General Assembly, Obama addressed concerns stemming from the latest attempts at mass violence, highlighting the importance of unity and resilience in the face of terror.

In his remarks, Obama emphasized that yielding to fear constitutes a victory for terrorists, stating clearly that the nation must steadfastly oppose such intimidation tactics. He praised local law enforcement agencies for their swift response to the bomb attacks that rocked New York and New Jersey, commending their efforts in maintaining safety and order during chaotic times.

With the recent bomb explosion in Chelsea resulting in dozens of injuries, investigations remain ongoing, and Obama underscored both the strength and determination of American citizens amidst these challenges. He pointed to the residents of New York and New Jersey as poignant examples of resilience and toughness, noting that the terrorists aim to inspire fear and disrupt daily life across the country. However, he urged citizens to resist succumbing to this intimidation.

The President expressed his pride in American fortitude, urging the public to remain vigilant and committed to national solidarity. “When we come together,” Obama said, “we show the world our strength.” His visit and remarks serve as a reminder of the ongoing threats to public safety and the collective resolve required to confront them head on. As investigations into recent attacks proceed, Obama’s call for resilience resonates with the citizens determined to stand firm against the forces of terror.",-6.0,0.0,331.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.01812688821752266,328.0,0.0,0.0
Real_50-Webpage,Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity,"United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.

The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.

At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.

""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.

Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""

JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45

""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.

""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""

The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.

A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.

Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.

""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""

Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.

""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.

""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.

The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.

""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement.

But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.

""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.""

The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.

The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.

""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""

Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.

""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.""

But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.

""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""

As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.

The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.

Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.

And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp.

""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said.",http://cnn.it/2deTou2,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg,Laura Koran,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920104405-02-obama-un-0920-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920152131-obama-united-nations-general-assembly-origwx-bw-00000210-exlarge-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920093742-obama-leaders-collage-edited-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html,"{""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""author"": ""Laura Koran"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,art-vid"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""politics, Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity - CNNPolitics"", ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-20T22:23:38Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- President Barack Obama urged countries to address the global refugee crisis at the United Nations.

In a compelling address at the United Nations, President Barack Obama called for a concerted global effort to address the burgeoning refugee crisis, which affects millions of displaced people worldwide. His remarks were set against a backdrop of political resistance in the United States, where a growing segment of the public has expressed apprehension about accepting refugees fleeing violence, particularly from the Middle East.

In an attempt to galvanize international attention and action, President Obama convened the Leaders' Summit on Refugees. This significant event highlights the daunting reality faced by tens of millions of displaced individuals and serves as a catalyst for world leaders to engage actively in addressing this humanitarian challenge. The urgency of the situation was emphasized by the staggering figures arising from a recent United Nations study, which revealed that in 2015 alone, over 65.3 million people were forcibly displaced – a record high. Out of this number, roughly 21.3 million individuals were classified specifically as refugees.

President Obama underscored the moral imperative facing nations in light of this crisis, stating that the global community is undergoing a critical test of its common humanity. He criticized the notion of erecting physical barriers, such as walls, in an effort to exclude refugees from desperate circumstances. “This crisis is not just about borders; it’s about our shared values,"" he stated, urging leaders to recognize their collective responsibility to assist those in dire need.

One of the most severe elements of the global refugee crisis is the ongoing conflict in Syria, which has resulted in a staggering 4.8 million people fleeing violence and turmoil. This alarming displacement underscores the urgency for comprehensive action and international cooperation, as the Syrian crisis continues to create waves of refugees, not just in the region but throughout the world. The president pointed out that the historical failures to respond effectively to such crises pose significant concerns for today's global landscape, stressing the need for collective action to avert potential future tragedies.

The summit aimed to tackle the broader implications of the refugee crisis by establishing ambitious goals, including a mandate to increase funding for humanitarian assistance by at least 30% and to double the number of refugees permanently resettled. Leaders were called upon to pledge additional contributions and to develop more equitable strategies for managing refugee flows across borders, thereby ensuring that no one nation bears an overwhelming burden.

Despite the optimistic rhetoric surrounding the summit, aid organizations voiced skepticism about the likelihood of concrete results emerging from the discussions. Many advocates emphasized that while the statements made at the summit may indicate goodwill, tangible commitments are necessary to effect real change. As a result, there remains cautious optimism among humanitarian groups such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) regarding the actual implementation of pledges made during the gathering.

In light of these developments, President Obama announced that the United States would increase its intake of refugees from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 in 2017. However, this plan faces significant resistance in Congress, where lawmakers are divided on the issue of accepting refugees. The presidential announcement is seen as a move toward addressing criticism levied at the administration regarding its handling of the refugee influx and its broader immigration policies.

As discussions unfolded at the summit, leaders highlighted the importance of equitable management of refugee flows across countries, recognizing the necessity for collaboration beyond national borders. Nations like South Sudan have also recently seen alarming increases in refugee numbers, with reports indicating that the country has surpassed 1 million refugees. This surge contributes to the cumulative impact of the crises in not only South Sudan but also Syria and Somalia, which together represent a considerable share of the global displaced population.

The metaphor of walls, frequently invoked by critics in the context of immigration, was a focal point of Obama’s address. He argued that such defenses are not only ineffective but also counterproductive to the ideals of shared humanity and responsibility. Instead of fostering isolationism, Obama urged nations to embrace a more inclusive stance toward refugees, recognizing that compassion and solidarity are paramount in addressing such a widespread humanitarian issue.

The call for increased humanitarian contributions also resonated throughout the gathering, signaling a growing consensus among leaders that financial resources must be bolstered to adequately address the needs of refugees and their host communities. The summit sought to catalyze a commitment to sustainable funding that can facilitate ongoing support for humanitarian programs aimed at assisting those affected by conflict, persecution, and natural disasters.

While the prospect of achieving substantial progress in the global response to the refugee crisis seems daunting, Obama’s leadership at the UN signifies a pivotal moment in international discourse surrounding refugees. The attention brought to this issue during the summit serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility that lies with nations to protect the rights and dignity of those fleeing instability.

As leaders departed from the gathering, their commitment to prioritize the plight of refugees will be tested in the weeks and months ahead. Implementing the proposed increases in resettlement and funding will be the true measure of success, as the world watches to see whether nations can rise to the challenge and take meaningful action.

In conclusion, the Leaders' Summit on Refugees was an essential response to an urgent call for action in addressing one of the most pressing humanitarian crises of our time. As the global community reflects on the implications of the discussions held at the UN, the true challenge remains: transforming words into deeds that will bring hope and relief to the millions of displaced individuals around the globe who are in desperate need of assistance and sanctuary. The path forward hinges on the ability of nations to act collaboratively and humanely in the spirit of our shared humanity.",-13.0,3.0,1293.0,-0.325,-0.010054137664346482,1074.0,0.08571428571428572,0.002793296089385475
Real_51-Webpage,Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings,"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues

It's a recurring theme of his campaign

Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions.

The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law.

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.

""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

Real_52-Webpage,In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism,"Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.

The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.

But the ""he said/she said"" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics.

Story Continued Below

While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?

In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.

Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.

But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.

As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both ""he said and she said""—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.

One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?

I don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.

The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.

Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.

Obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.

The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.”

Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.

The last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”

If you’re not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.

In recent years, the evolving landscape of journalism has been the subject of extensive debate, particularly concerning the methodology employed in news reporting. Prominently, the ""he said/she said"" approach, which attempts to provide a balanced view by presenting multiple sides of a story, has drawn both support and criticism. This format has notably been under scrutiny since its critiques gained momentum in 2009, especially from figures like Jay Rosen, a professor at New York University. 

While the intent behind the ""he said/she said"" method is ostensibly to create impartiality, its application has faced backlash. Recently, the New York Times' coverage of former President Donald Trump, in which his statements were openly labeled as lies, has reignited the contentious discussions surrounding this reporting style. Trump's presidency was marked by contentious statements, many of which contradicted established facts. By explicitly identifying these statements as falsehoods, the newspaper has not only spurred debate regarding journalistic ethics and biases but also highlighted the potential limitations of traditional reporting formats.

Critics of the ""he said/she said"" framework argue that moving away from it paves the way for accountability. By directly labeling untruthfulness when it occurs, journalists can provide clarity to their readers and emphasize the dishonesty prevalent in political discourse. This direct approach, they argue, is essential in an age characterized by misinformation and political spin, where audiences risk being misled by false equivalencies. They contend that when journalism fails to speak out against obvious fabrications, it loses its credibility and can undercut the democratic process by allowing false narratives to proliferate unchecked.

However, the critiques have not gone unchallenged. Detractors of abandoning the ""he said/she said"" model fear that discarding this structure might lead to biased reporting. The concern is that journalism could evolve into a one-sided narrative that neglects the complexities of real-world issues. Defending the traditional format, some journalists advocate for its ability to accommodate diverse perspectives, ensuring that minority viewpoints are not overlooked. In this view, ""he said/she said"" journalism fosters an environment of critical thinking, providing readers with a fuller picture of events rather than a stark dichotomy of truth versus lies.

Historical precedents illustrate the significance of dissent and minority opinions in shaping policy and scientific understanding. There have been numerous instances where minority viewpoints have triggered paradigm shifts, fundamentally altering accepted knowledge and practices. By preserving a space for contrasting perspectives, the ""he said/she said"" method can contribute to a robust discourse that challenges the status quo. Without such representation, crucial debates may be stifled, leading to an echo chamber effect that marginalizes differing opinions.

Moreover, maintaining a commitment to the ""he said/she said"" format serves a vital function in combating the self-segregation of audiences consuming media. In today’s fragmented media landscape, where individuals can easily opt for news that aligns with their preconceived beliefs, balanced reporting becomes paramount. By providing a platform for competing viewpoints, journalists can encourage a wider range of discussions, promoting balanced news consumption rather than ideologically driven narratives.

Finally, despite its shortcomings, the practical value of the ""he said/she said"" method remains significant. In an era fraught with complexities and contentious issues, maintaining rigor in reporting—while also incorporating diverse perspectives—is critical for fostering understanding. While some argue that the explicit labeling of falsehoods can bolster accountability, it is equally important to recognize the role of traditional journalistic methods in nurturing an informed and engaged public.

In summary, the debate over ""he said/she said"" journalism is indicative of broader tensions within the field regarding how to balance objective reporting with accountability in an age of misinformation. Ultimately, while modern journalism continues to evolve, the foundational principles that promote honest reporting and comprehensive understanding of complex issues retain their importance, underscoring the vital role that diverse perspectives play in shaping informed public discourse.",6.0,7.0,2265.0,0.06593406593406594,0.0026490066225165563,738.0,0.25,0.009485094850948509
Real_53-Webpage,Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. […] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”

Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has gained national attention as a frequent guest on Fox News, where he has openly criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, drawing extreme comparisons to international terrorists. His strong stance has resonated with supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom Clarke fervently backs. His vocal support for Trump was prominently displayed at the Republican National Convention earlier this year.

However, Clarke's law enforcement leadership has come under scrutiny following the death of Terrill Thomas, a 38-year-old inmate at the Milwaukee County Jail. Thomas was found dead on April 24, just nine days after his arrest, while Clarke was busy making television appearances. Reports indicate that Thomas died from severe dehydration, and inmates reported hearing him plead for water in the days leading up to his demise.

The Milwaukee County medical examiner ruled Thomas' death a homicide due to profound dehydration. Eyewitness accounts from fellow inmates claim that Thomas' cell water was shut off for six days, despite several warnings to jail staff about the dangerous implications for his health. An attorney representing some inmates has voiced concerns, stating that he received distressing calls regarding the lack of water, reminiscent of a similar incident in 2011 when another inmate lost his life.

In the wake of this tragic event, Clarke's continued involvement in a pro-Trump bus tour, backed by a supporting super PAC, raises questions about his priorities while serving as sheriff. 

Financially, reports reveal that Clarke earned over $150,000 in 2015 derived from a combination of speaking fees, travel reimbursements, and gifts. This income underscores a potential conflict between his media presence and the responsibilities of his role as sheriff. As public scrutiny intensifies over the events leading to Thomas' death, Clarke's strong political affiliations and high-profile media engagements draw increasing attention from both supporters and critics.

As investigations continue and the community grapples with the implications of Thomas' death, the future of Clarke's tenure remains uncertain, with many calling for accountability and reform within the Milwaukee County Jail system.",-25.0,-27.0,375.0,-1.9230769230769231,-0.06666666666666667,395.0,-1.9285714285714286,-0.06835443037974684

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?”

In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

“I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

In a recent statement that has ignited considerable debate within political and media circles, Janet Brown, head of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), expressed skepticism regarding the efficacy of fact-checking during presidential debates. Her remarks have raised questions about the role of debate moderators and the larger implications for electoral integrity as the nation moves closer to the upcoming elections.

Brown's comments come amidst ongoing concerns voiced by the Trump campaign, which has openly criticized the notion of moderators actively calling out lies during debates. The campaign's insistence on a more permissive format reflects a broader strategy to reframe discourse around truthfulness, especially regarding statements made by the former president. Trump supporters seem to embrace the idea of allowing him to speak without interruption, suggesting this approach is vital to Trump's success in engaging with voters.

The skepticism expressed by Brown has struck a chord with the Trump campaign, which has argued that moderators should not intervene to correct perceived misstatements. This viewpoint suggests a shift towards a more lenient discourse, where candidates are encouraged to present their positions without the filter of immediate fact-checking. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of such a stance raise significant questions about the accountability of candidates and the responsibilities of moderators.

According to Politico's analysis, Donald Trump is estimated to make false statements at a staggering rate of approximately once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. This alarming frequency of misrepresentation encompasses a wide range of topics, including serious issues such as the Iraq war, health care policy, and crime rates. Such patterns of dishonesty underscore the importance of critical oversight and fact-checking within the debate format, as voters depend on accurate information to make informed decisions.

Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the honesty of Trump and his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, reveals a striking disparity. The findings indicate that Trump lies significantly more frequently than Clinton, highlighting the unique challenge faced by moderators and the media in presenting accurate information to the public. As voters prepare to engage with candidates, the push for transparency and factual accuracy becomes increasingly crucial.

Responding to Brown's skepticism, members of the journalism community have voiced their disapproval, emphasizing the potential dangers of a debate environment devoid of fact-checking. Many journalists questioned the very role of moderators if they are expected to refrain from addressing inaccuracies. This concern points to a fundamental aspect of democratic discourse—ensuring that candidates are held accountable for their statements and that voters are equipped with the truth.

The notion of allowing unchallenged statements during debates also illuminates a broader divide in public perception regarding truth in politics. While Trump supporters may celebrate the absence of fact-checking during debates, viewing it as an opportunity for their candidate to communicate freely, the implications for democratic processes are troubling. The potential for misinformation to proliferate unchecked poses a risk to informed voter engagement and the overall integrity of electoral proceedings.

As the discussion around fact-checking in presidential debates intensifies, the stakes are higher than ever. The decisions made by Brown and the CPD will likely shape the contours of the upcoming electoral landscape, influencing not just how debates are conducted but also how candidates communicate with the public. The delicate balance between allowing candidates to express their views and ensuring that voters receive truthful information is at the heart of this debate.

In a time when misinformation can spread rapidly through social media and other outlets, the importance of rigorous fact-checking cannot be overstated. Voters must be equipped with accurate information to navigate the complexities of the issues at hand and make choices that reflect their values and priorities.

As the Trump campaign continues to push for a more relaxed debate framework, the implications of such a shift extend beyond the immediate electoral context. A lack of fact-checking could lead to a normalization of dishonest rhetoric, establishing a precedent that may influence future elections and the manner in which candidates engage with one another.

With the election looming, the debate about the role of moderators and the necessity of fact-checking remains at the forefront of political discourse. The path forward will require careful consideration of the impact of these decisions on the electorate, as well as the ethical responsibilities of those tasked with guiding the national conversation during these pivotal moments.

As Brown's skepticism sparks discussion among journalists, political analysts, and the public, one thing remains clear: The pursuit of truth in political discourse is an essential component of a vibrant democracy, and the choices made by moderators will significantly impact the electoral landscape in the coming months. The challenge lies in balancing the freedom of expression with the paramount importance of honesty, ensuring that voters are equipped to engage thoughtfully and responsibly in the democratic process.

In concluding remarks, it is evident that the role of fact-checking in presidential debates is not just a procedural matter; it is a cornerstone of democratic engagement that must be protected and preserved. As election season heats up, the overarching question will persist: How can we ensure that truth prevails in the crucial conversations that shape our future?",11.0,10.0,839.0,0.3235294117647059,0.013110846245530394,952.0,0.30303030303030304,0.01050420168067227

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.

“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.

“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

In a post-debate analysis, Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, praised the former president's demeanor during his recent face-off against Democratic contender Hillary Clinton. The debate, which attracted significant attention and set the stage for their contentious campaign, provided a moment for both candidates to showcase not only their policies but also their personalities.

Conway emphasized Trump's ability to maintain composure in the face of direct attacks from Clinton regarding his controversial history with women. She remarked that Trump demonstrated a sense of restraint that could be viewed as a presidential virtue, a quality often highlighted during electoral contests where emotions can run high. ""He showed remarkable restraint, especially when confronted with issues concerning his past remarks,"" Conway stated, indicating that Trump's choice to not retaliate aggressively against Clinton's criticisms spoke volumes about his character.

During the debate, Trump hinted at his choice to avoid making any disparaging comments about Clinton and her family, suggesting he felt uncomfortable bringing up offensive remarks when their family was present. This choice, according to Conway, further illustrated his restraint and maturity as a candidate who understood the sensitivities involved in public discourse. These remarks reveal an aspect of Trump's strategy that stresses empathy, even when faced with direct attacks.

Despite the apparent civility, Conway suggested that Trump had substantial grounds to challenge Clinton, particularly regarding the long-standing controversies surrounding former President Bill Clinton's record with women. ""He could have taken a stance against those controversies, but he opted for a more measured approach, which I believe speaks to his capacity for presidential behavior,"" she noted. Such decisions not only shape the debate's narrative but also position Trump in a light often perceived as a more nuanced leader.

On the flip side, Conway was less forgiving of Clinton’s performance. She critiqued Clinton for lacking a decisive argument during the debate. In her view, the former Secretary of State seemed overly rehearsed, favoring memorized talking points over genuine responses to the pressing questions posed. ""Her focus on repeating her script made her responses feel disconnected from the live audience and the issues at stake,"" Conway observed. It is a concern that resonates with voters looking for authenticity and connection from their leaders.

Conway asserted that Trump was more effective in addressing the questions brought up during the debate. “He answered the questions presented without diverging into unnecessary rhetoric, while Hillary's responses lacked any meaningful takeaway that would truly convince voters seeking change,” she quoted. This distinction between the candidates played a crucial role in how they were perceived by the electorate, intensifying the contrast between their styles.

In a highly polarized political climate, the importance of debates cannot be understated, and perceptions formed during these moments can often influence voter sentiment leading up to election day. Conway’s analysis sought to reinforce Trump’s strengths while raising doubts about Clinton’s authenticity and effectiveness.

Conway's comments reflect a strategic assessment aimed at showcasing Trump as a candidate capable of rising above petty squabbles and focusing on substantive issues. By framing Trump’s restraint as a strong point, she underscores a critical narrative of the campaign: that voters should expect more from their leaders than just divisive rhetoric.

As the campaign trail continues, both candidates will undoubtedly face new challenges and opportunities. Conway’s reflections on the recent debate suggest that for Trump, the emphasis on restraint and strategy could be pivotal in appealing to undecided voters, especially as the election draws nearer. The dynamics of these debates will shape not only the candidates' images but also their prospects in the face of a highly competitive electoral landscape.",5.0,16.0,650.0,0.35714285714285715,0.007692307692307693,706.0,0.6153846153846154,0.0226628895184136

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

[A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,,https://www.washingtonpost.com,{'$date': 1474243200000},,"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg&w=60,https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,"{""theme"": ""normal"", ""news_keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Washington Post"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste."", ""title"": ""France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery"", ""url"": ""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""image"": ""https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""unsafe-url"", ""twitter"": {""site"": ""@WashingtonPost"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""creator"": ""jameskmcauley""}, ""object-hash"": 1503984085, ""robots"": ""index,follow"", ""apple-itunes-app"": ""app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 500835072, ""app_id"": 41245586762}, ""keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste.""}","- France has become the first country to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils.

In a landmark move to combat plastic pollution, France has emerged as the first nation to enact a comprehensive ban on plastic plates, cups, and utensils, a decision that marks a significant step towards sustainable living. This groundbreaking legislation, set to take effect in 2020, aligns with the country’s ambitious targets to promote environmental health and a cleaner future. 

The new law, part of the broader Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, reflects France’s commitment to a circular economy, where waste management is intricately connected to product design and recycling practices. Alongside the ban on single-use plastic tableware, the legislation has already prohibited plastic bags in grocery stores, implementing the ban from July. This comprehensive approach aims to mitigate the environmental hazards posed by plastic materials, particularly their lasting impact on wildlife and oceans.

Plastics, notoriously resistant to biodegradation, break down into harmful microplastics that jeopardize marine ecosystems and terrestrial wildlife alike. The detrimental effects of plastic on the environment have sparked growing concerns among scientists, conservationists, and policymakers. By banning single-use plastics, France seeks to eliminate one of the most significant contributors to ocean pollution and encourage a shift towards more sustainable practices.

The high production of plastic items also plays a crucial role in exacerbating climate change, consuming millions of barrels of oil every year. In his support of the initiative, French President François Hollande emphasized that reducing plastic use is integral to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing the reliance on renewable energy sources. This legislation not only seeks to preserve biodiversity but also aims to align with essential climate action commitments.

However, the passage of this law has not been without controversy. The Socialist government champions the initiative as a progressive environmental measure, yet some critics in Brussels argue that it potentially contravenes EU regulations concerning the free movement of goods and may inadvertently disadvantage manufacturers. Concerns surrounding the law's implications on trade and industry have intensified discussions within the European community.

Pack2Go Europe, an organization representing the interests of manufacturers and suppliers, has publicly declared its intention to challenge the ban, calling upon the European Commission to intervene and take legal action against France. Their argument is based on the premise of protecting economic interests against what they perceive as overreaching legislation that may hamper competitiveness.

Initial advocacy for the plastic ban began as early as 2017, driven by environmental activists and organizations striving for immediate legislative action. However, the government opted to postpone its implementation to assess its potential impact on low-income families, ensuring that the transition away from plastic is equitable and considerate of economic realities.

As France takes definitive steps towards a more sustainable lifestyle, the implications of this law may reach far beyond its borders. By leading the charge against plastic pollution, France could set a precedent for other nations grappling with the environmental crisis posed by plastic waste. The unfolding developments surrounding this legislation will undoubtedly be pivotal as global discussions about sustainability and the future of our planet continue.",-14.0,2.0,529.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.026465028355387523,571.0,0.09523809523809523,0.0035026269702276708

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump.

""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,"" Ryan said.

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.

But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.

What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.

The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said.

As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first?

CHARLOTTE, NC — A wave of speculation and anger has engulfed Charlotte in the wake of the shooting of a Black man by local police, leading to significant unrest and riots across North Carolina. The incident has sparked fierce debate around the narrative of innocence surrounding the victim, with demonstrators expressing their discontent through widespread looting and theft, culminating in the shutdown of Interstate 85.

The victim has been portrayed by some as a figure deeply involved in charitable activities, igniting a narrative that casts doubt on the conduct of law enforcement. As protests grew in intensity, questions emerged regarding the validity of the police's account of the events, amplified by public outrage and a demand for transparency.

In response to the escalating demonstrations, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney held a news conference where he discussed the details leading up to the incident. According to Chief Putney, the victim, Keith Scott, exited his vehicle while armed with a handgun, prompting police officers on the scene to command him to drop the weapon. Putney asserted that this action led officers to perceive Scott as a potential threat, which justified their decision to use lethal force.

Putney's remarks shine a spotlight on the complexities surrounding the interpretation of police actions and the events that led to Scott's death. He emphasized the necessity to reshape the narrative, indicating that the portrayal on social media did not align with the facts as presented by law enforcement. 

The riots ignited by this incident reflect deeper concerns among community members regarding safety and the perception of threats by law enforcement. Such unrest raises critical questions about the relationships between police officers and the communities they serve, particularly within marginalized neighborhoods. 

In the midst of rising tensions, law enforcement has expressed considerable anxiety regarding their own safety while on duty, along with concerns about being judged in a highly polarized environment. Critics have leveled their frustrations at ""progressives"" whom they believe lack the qualifications to make informed assessments concerning police actions. This discord has only intensified the already fragile dialogue between community activists and law enforcement agencies.

As the aftermath of this shooting continues to unfold, the Charlotte community grapples with conflicting narratives about justice and accountability. The events have reignited discussions around policing practices, community relations, and the systemic issues that lead to confrontations between law enforcement and Black citizens.

Calls for accountability and reform are expected to grow in number, as community leaders push for an earnest dialogue addressing these deep-seated issues. The question that remains is whether this tragic incident will serve as a catalyst for meaningful change or merely add fuel to an already volatile situation.

In the days to come, authorities will likely face mounting pressure to release more information about the shooting, including any body camera footage that may provide clarity on the events that transpired. The community, meanwhile, remains poised, vigilant, and divided, as emotions run high amid an ongoing struggle for justice and understanding in the shadow of tragedy. 

As Charlotte emerges from this tumultuous period, the need for healing and rebuilding trust between citizens and law enforcement has never been greater. Only time will reveal the long-term impact of this incident and the potential for reform in policing practices throughout the state.",-23.0,-26.0,562.0,-0.9583333333333334,-0.04092526690391459,613.0,-1.1818181818181819,-0.04241435562805873

ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June.

The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

""The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,"" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. ""As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.""

Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.

Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.

Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.

President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change.

The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.”

And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.”

The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both.

""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012

""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,"" Obama said, ""that worries me.""

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is ""naturally occurring.""

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, former President Barack Obama has reiterated his critical stance toward Donald Trump, emphasizing the Republican nominee's inadequacies in preparation, temperament, and trustworthiness to assume the highest office in the land. 

During a candid interview with Ryan Seacrest, Obama articulated his concerns, asserting that Trump's approach to crucial global issues falls short. Central to Obama's critique were two significant threats: nuclear proliferation and climate change. The former president argued that Trump fails to adequately address these pressing matters, which he believes are critical for the future of the country and the world.

Obama praised Hillary Clinton’s performance during the debate, emphasizing her qualifications that he believes make her a strong candidate for the presidency. He pointed out that her commitment to core values—such as inclusivity and providing opportunities for all Americans—contrasts sharply with what he identifies as Trump's shortcomings. 

Particularly alarming to Obama is Trump’s stance on U.S. obligations to allies such as Japan and South Korea. He stressed that Trump's views could lead to these nations pursuing their own nuclear capabilities, a situation that would critically undermine global security. Obama argued that the United States must maintain its commitment to protect its allies to prevent any escalation of nuclear armament.

On the topic of climate change, Obama took the opportunity to recall a contentious tweet from Trump dating back to November 2012, in which the businessman suggested that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by China. Obama emphasized the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change, proposing that the need for urgent action is imperative, not optional. 

In response to Obama’s observations, Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, asserted that Trump believes climate change is ""naturally occurring,"" indicating a divergence from the wide-ranging scientific endorsements calling for robust policy action.

Obama’s remarks serve as a call to action for voters, highlighting the critical choices facing America in this election cycle. As the election draws nearer, the former president's critique underscores the implications of leadership choices, particularly in managing nuclear policy and climate initiatives, in shaping the future for the U.S. and the globe.",-7.0,1.0,419.0,-0.5833333333333334,-0.016706443914081145,416.0,0.07142857142857142,0.002403846153846154
Real_60-Webpage,How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying “yes” to Fox News almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning, he is booked on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn’t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

Donald Trump’s political career has long been marked by his accessibility to the media and willingness to engage in interviews, a stance that has contributed significantly to his relationship with voters. However, recent patterns suggest a shift in his media strategy, with a noticeable focus on Fox News to the exclusion of other major networks.

In recent months, Trump has increasingly limited his interactions primarily to Fox News, where he frequently makes appearances on various programs. This concentration on a single network may enhance his connection with a loyal base, yet it also raises questions about his willingness to confront challenging questions that other outlets might pose. Critics suggest that this controlled approach allows Trump to circumvent difficult follow-ups on controversial subjects, such as the longstanding birther conspiracy and his administration's approach to terrorism, which could be detrimental should these topics arise later in the electoral process.

While focusing on a specific audience can solidify support among current followers, some analysts argue that this strategy might restrict Trump’s broader electoral appeal. Successful politicians often engage with a wider audience, facilitating outreach to undecided or moderate voters. Trump's inclination towards rallying crowds of his staunch supporters further emphasizes this trend; his campaign events draw predominantly those already aligned with him politically rather than attempting to win over a more diverse group of constituents.

The implications of this strategy are far-reaching. There exists a growing concern that Trump's heavy reliance on Fox News may lead to unforeseen consequences, especially in the wake of the surprise outcomes observed in past elections. The 2012 presidential cycle serves as a poignant reminder, as many Fox News viewers were caught off guard by the election results, unable to reconcile their expectations with the reality of voter sentiment.

In a rapidly evolving political landscape, Trump’s choice to engage predominantly with a single news outlet could signal a calculated effort to maintain the dedication of his existing supporters. However, this intentional narrowing of media interactions might backfire, alienating potential voters who are critical to securing broader electoral success.

Real_61-Webpage,“Why Aren’t I 50 Points Ahead?” – Eagle Rising,"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again.

Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.

But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.”

For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.

Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump?

At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question:

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

As the election approaches, the atmosphere surrounding Hillary Clinton's campaign is becoming increasingly tense. Initially, many liberals believed that Clinton's victory was all but guaranteed prior to election day. However, as the campaign unfolded, a strategy emerged that involved taking a low-key approach, allowing Donald Trump to dominate media coverage. This tactic, designed to draw attention away from the Clinton campaign, has not played out as expected. 

Following the Democratic National Convention (DNC), a sobering reality set in as the election proved to be far more competitive than anticipated. Many observers within the Democratic Party began to recognize that they had significantly underestimated the influence and reach of Trump and his supporters. This realization sparked a flurry of discussions among Democrats regarding a potential ""Plan B"" should the election take an unexpected turn.

Amid rising concerns, there has been particular scrutiny regarding Clinton's health, with worries that it could impact her campaign. The scrutiny over her well-being coupled with recent polling data has intensified the urgency of her message. Reports from various polls indicate that Trump is leading in several key battleground states, raising alarms within Clinton’s camp. 

In light of these developments, Clinton expressed her bafflement at a campaign event when she noted that she was not significantly ahead in the polls, despite expectations of her dominating the race. Her remarks underscored the mounting pressure on her campaign and the need to galvanize support.

Clinton urged her supporters to take action, encouraging them to help disseminate information about Trump's record and the implications of a Trump presidency. She voiced her concerns about the misinformation that may sway voters, questioning why her standing in the polls did not reflect her campaign efforts or the party's collective aspirations.

In an emotional appeal, Clinton urged her supporters to ""stage an intervention"" for anyone contemplating a vote for Trump. Her emphasis on the importance of sharing facts with friends and maintaining loyalty underscores the campaign's acknowledgment of the challenges ahead. 

As the election date draws nearer, the pressure mounts for Clinton and her team to redefine their narrative and overcome the undercurrents that threaten to reshape the electoral landscape. With the stakes higher than ever, both loyalists and undecided voters remain critical to the outcome in an election that is proving to be anything but predictable.",11.0,11.0,413.0,0.6875,0.026634382566585957,444.0,0.6111111111111112,0.024774774774774775

Over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, Bobby Knight said Wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like Donald Trump.

""There’s nobody that I’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right,"" Knight told an audience in Toledo, Ohio, his home state. ""And I think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United States. And there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been Donald Trump.""

Story Continued Below

Back on the campaign trail with Trump after several months, Knight extolled the Republican nominee as ""not just an American; he’s a world figure.""

""He’s known all over the world. Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together,"" the coach continued. ""United States around the world. A lot of businesses. Created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world.""

And Trump, Knight later indicated, is the person for the White House.

""Believe me when I tell you, I think you’re all gonna agree on this: Our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the United States of America,"" Knight said. He noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, ""immigration problems and on and on.""

Remarking on his study of history, Knight said that he had come to the conclusion that ""when I need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man I want to choose and the first man I want to see.""

Knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't ""dress as well as politicians dress, but I want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, I wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""

""And I think that when you leave, I hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the United States,"" Knight said.

Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it. Although Islamic terrorism would seem to be the most likely explanation, there have been “mad bombers” who’ve done this sort of thing before (See Ted Kaczynski & George Metesky).

Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation.

That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.

ELIZABETH, New Jersey – Authorities are investigating the discovery of three pipe bombs and two smaller explosive devices found in a trash can near the NJ Transit Station in Elizabeth. The alarming find was confirmed by Elizabeth Mayor, who stated that the scene is now being handled by the FBI.

The FBI has promptly responded to the incident, which adds to a troubling pattern of previous bomb incidents reported along the Jersey Shore and in neighboring New York. The authorities speculate that the explosives may be linked to either a small group or potentially a single individual, raising concerns about the intentions behind these devices.

While officials have not definitively established a motive, Islamic terrorism is considered a likely possibility. However, the investigation also references historical cases reminiscent of ‘mad bombers’ where individuals have acted out of personal grievances or other motives not related to terrorism. This ambiguity raises pressing questions about whether the intention behind the bombs was to instill fear or to inflict mass casualties.

In a related note, the FBI has recently arrested five individuals who may be connected to the investigation of a previous bombing incident in Chelsea, New York. Despite these arrests, no formal charges have been filed as of yet, indicating that investigators are still piecing together the connections between various incidents.

As the investigation unfolds, authorities remain committed to ensuring public safety and have urged residents in the area to remain vigilant. The FBI has urged anyone with information about the incident or any suspicious activity to come forward to assist with the ongoing investigation.

Details surrounding the devices and further specifics about the investigation remain sparse as officials continue to assess the situation. Members of the community are cautiously aware of the implications of the explosive findings, while law enforcement agencies work diligently to uncover the details behind this troubling event.

Authorities are expected to provide further updates as the investigation progresses, and residents are reminded to remain alert and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.",-14.0,-18.0,392.0,-0.9333333333333333,-0.03571428571428571,380.0,-1.2857142857142858,-0.04736842105263158

(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it.

Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video , plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself.

""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs.

Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump.

""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention.

Magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect

A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said.

""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening.

Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami.

""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer.""

The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.

Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

The defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, James Patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.

- Defense attorney James Patton did not respond to requests for comment on the ruling.","A recent court ruling has delayed the arraignment of Ahmad Rahami, the suspect linked to September bombings in New Jersey and New York. U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein ruled against the request for Rahami's immediate appearance in federal court, maintaining that he is not required to do so until he is taken into federal custody.

At present, Rahami remains in the custody of local New Jersey law enforcement officials, where he is recovering from injuries sustained during his apprehension. Gorenstein pointed out that the federal government had yet to arrest Rahami, and there was no evidence to suggest the contrary. This decision is pivotal as it establishes that until federal authorities take custody, the processes in federal court will not commence.

The defense team representing Rahami argued that federal law enforcement had a role in his detention and questioning. However, Magistrate Gorenstein countered the defense’s assertion, stating that there was no verifiable involvement from federal agents during the state-level processes. This ruling underscores the distinction between state and federal jurisdictions, particularly regarding the timing of legal proceedings.

In light of the circumstances, Gorenstein also dismissed claims that federal court rules mandated Rahami's prompt arraignment in the face of ongoing state charges. He further noted that the arraignment would not be scheduled while Rahami remains hospitalized in Newark. Furthermore, the magistrate refrained from appointing federal defense representation for Rahami, a move that reflects the complexities of the case as it navigates multiple legal jurisdictions.

Despite the absence of immediate federal charges, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced intentions to transfer Rahami to New York City soon, where he would face a federal complaint. This maneuver suggests that the pending federal complaint is expected to take precedence over the state charges currently against him in New Jersey.

The decision from U.S. Magistrate Judge Gorenstein has drawn attention, yet U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office opted not to comment on the Magistrate's ruling. Additionally, defense attorney James Patton did not respond to inquiries regarding the ruling.

As legal proceedings unfold, the trajectory of Rahami's case is likely to remain a focal point for both federal and state authorities. The upcoming transfer and arraignment will be crucial steps in addressing the allegations and ensuring that justice is served in light of the serious nature of the charges against him. As of now, the legal landscape remains dynamic as stakeholders await further developments in this high-profile case.",-25.0,-23.0,471.0,-1.5625,-0.05307855626326964,444.0,-1.2777777777777777,-0.0518018018018018
Real_66-Webpage,US: ISIS did not use mustard agent in base attack,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL — OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

Real_67-Webpage,"Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say","The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.

""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.

Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.

A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.

The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.

""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.

He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""

James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.

""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.

""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg,"More Meghan,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997,"{""fb_title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@mkeneally"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-19"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-19 18:04:32"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race""}","- Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have heightened interest in candidates' national security policies.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator, asserts that these recent terrorist events are likely to influence voter sentiment significantly. ""Fear tends to push voters toward candidates who appear stronger on national security,"" he noted, implying that the candidates must adeptly adjust their messages to capture the electorate's concerns.

Polling data conducted prior to the attacks revealed that Clinton had a lead in voters' trust regarding terrorism management. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken on September 11 indicated that Clinton enjoyed a 50% trust rating compared to Trump’s 41% among all adults surveyed. Furthermore, a CBS/New York Times poll conducted shortly afterward on September 14 showed that 49% of respondents favored Clinton over her Republican rival in terms of handling terrorism and national security. Similarly, a Quinnipiac poll from September 15 recorded Clinton at 49% and Trump trailing closely with 47% on the matter of keeping the nation safe from terrorist threats.

However, Cohen pointed out a potential shift in public perception surrounding the Republican Party's strength in national security, particularly expressing concerns about Trump's grasp of terrorism issues. The attacks have prompted candidates to recalibrate their campaigns, emphasizing national security in their speeches to reassure voters seeking stability and safety in perilous times.

Amidst these developments, Cohen raised a cautionary note regarding Trump’s rhetoric. He suggested that the language used by the Republican candidate could potentially inspire actions among extremists, inadvertently contributing to the problem rather than alleviating it.

James Campbell, a political science professor, provided further insight into the repercussions of the attacks on public perception and political fortunes. He argued that these recent incidents might ultimately bolster Trump’s support while harming Clinton's candidacy, indicating that the public may perceive current foreign policy as lacking effectiveness. In times of crisis, Campbell noted, voters are often drawn to candidates promising a tougher approach to national security.

This shift in sentiment could lead to heightened calls for more stringent immigration policies, especially concerning individuals with names that may sound Muslim. The fear generated by such terrorist attacks often steers public sentiment towards isolationist viewpoints, which could influence policy discussions significantly in the coming days.

As the national security debate intensifies, it remains to be seen how the candidates will further modify their positions and messaging to address voters' anxieties effectively. With the looming election season, issues of safety, security, and immigration are likely to dominate discussions, impacting voter behavior as individuals weigh their choices in the upcoming polls.

In conclusion, the recent attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota have not only resulted in heightened public concern but have also set the stage for significant shifts in political dynamics. Candidates’ abilities to position themselves as strong leaders in national security may prove crucial as they navigate the evolving landscape shaped by voter anxiety and calls for change. The electoral implications of these tragic events are profound and will undoubtedly echo through the campaign trails in the days to come.",6.0,-15.0,604.0,0.3333333333333333,0.009933774834437087,638.0,-0.6818181818181818,-0.023510971786833857

When is the first general election presidential debate?

The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.

Story Continued Below

What time is the debate and how long is it?

The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.

How can I watch the debate?

It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.

Who will participate in the debate?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.

Who will moderate the debate?

Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.

What is the format of the debate?

The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.

Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?

Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.

What's at stake for Hillary Clinton?

The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.

What's at stake for Donald Trump?

Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again.

What is the most watched debate in presidential history?

In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.

What's the most-watched television moment of all time?

Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.

Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.

The highly anticipated first general election presidential debate for 2016 will take center stage at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, on September 26. Beginning promptly at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the debate promises to captivate viewers for 90 uninterrupted minutes, as it streams across major television networks and online platforms, including prominent cable news websites and C-SPAN.

The debate will feature two of the most prominent figures in the current political landscape: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and real estate mogul Donald Trump. Their participation marks a significant milestone, as these candidates are the only individuals to qualify for this pivotal contest, with no additional candidates meeting the threshold set by the debate commission.

NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt is set to moderate the event, marking his second time taking on this crucial role during the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt's experience is anticipated to bring a level of professionalism and impartiality to the proceedings, as he guides the candidates through the debate structure.

The format of the debate is designed to facilitate a dynamic exchange of ideas and policies. It will comprise six segments, each lasting 15 minutes. Candidates will commence with initial responses to posed questions, followed by opportunities for rebuttal. This structure aims to encourage engagement and provide viewers with an in-depth understanding of each candidate's position on key issues.

While the final topics for discussion are still subject to adjustment based on current events, preliminary themes include “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” These pivotal issues are likely to resonate with voters, especially as the nation grapples with various socioeconomic challenges.

Notably, other prominent candidates, such as Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, will not participate in the debate. They failed to secure a place on the stage, having not met the required 15 percent threshold in selected national polls. This absence highlights the two-party dominance in U.S. presidential debates and emphasizes the crucial stakes for Clinton and Trump in this high-stakes showdown.

For Hillary Clinton, the debate serves as an opportunity to regain momentum in a tightly contested race. With her extensive background in public service and policy knowledge, Clinton aims to leverage her experience to illustrate her capability to lead the nation effectively. The debate may provide her with a platform to articulate her vision for America and address pressing concerns that resonate with the electorate.

On the other hand, Donald Trump is preparing to face scrutiny over his policy knowledge and self-restraint. Despite facing challenges in presenting a well-rounded policy agenda, Trump benefits from lower expectations set by analysts and pundits. If he manages to convey a more moderate stance during the debate, he may win over undecided voters and reassure his supporters that he is capable of transitioning into a presidential role.

Historically, debates have had the potential to shift the course of campaigns. The most-watched debate in U.S. history occurred in 1980 when President Jimmy Carter faced challenger Ronald Reagan, attracting an impressive 80.6 million viewers. This widespread viewership highlights the public's keen interest in political discourse and underscores the importance of engaging with voters through televised debates.

In a world where media consumption varies widely, the 2016 debate is expected to attract significant attention. While it may not surpass the viewership of Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, which recorded 114 million viewers, it will nonetheless be an event that many Americans will not want to miss. Historically significant global events, such as the moon landing and royal weddings, have drawn larger audiences, setting a high bar for this political spectacle.

As the nation braces for this pivotal event, both candidates are preparing to convey their visions to the American public. The debate at Hofstra University on September 26 will not only set the tone for the remainder of the campaign but also serve as a crucial benchmark in the voters' decision-making process. With the eyes of the country focused on this significant political engagement, the stakes could not be higher. The enduring impact of this debate may very well shape the future of the 2016 presidential race.",14.0,47.0,780.0,0.3684210526315789,0.017948717948717947,770.0,1.5666666666666667,0.06103896103896104
Real_69-Webpage,U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court,"Under the Radar Blog Archives Select Date… July, 2017 June, 2017 May, 2017 April, 2017 March, 2017 February, 2017 January, 2017 December, 2016 November, 2016 October, 2016 September, 2016 August, 2016

Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday in Linden, N.J. | Nicolaus Czarnecki/Boston Herald via AP U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing.

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.

However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved.

""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""

The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.

Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.

While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.

The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.

Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect implicated in a series of violent incidents, is currently in custody following a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left both Rahami and two law enforcement officers injured, highlighting the serious nature of the charges he faces.

Rahami, who is now subject to multiple legal proceedings, has been charged with five counts of attempted murder in connection with the shootout. His defense attorneys swiftly petitioned for him to be arraigned on federal charges, expressing urgency in the legal process for their client. However, federal prosecutors have stated that there is no legal obligation for federal courts to intervene at this stage, as Rahami is not currently in federal custody.

Presently, Rahami is being held under state custody in New Jersey, with a hefty bail package set at $5.2 million. This significant amount reflects the gravity of the charges he faces and the potential risks associated with his release.

Complicating matters further, defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been without legal counsel since his arrest. This lack of representation raises questions about his rights and his ability to navigate the complex legal landscape he currently finds himself in. While his attorneys stress the necessity for an immediate arraignment, the precise extent of Rahami's cooperation with law enforcement remains unclear, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to his case.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch has indicated that Rahami is expected to be moved to Manhattan in the near future, which may prompt the required proceedings in federal court. However, federal prosecutors have shown little urgency in addressing the situation, leaving many questions unanswered. 

As the situation stands, no immediate action has been taken by federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein concerning the arraignment or the appointment of defense lawyers. This lack of movement has caused frustration among defense attorneys, who are eager to facilitate their client’s legal defense.

The U.S. Attorney's office reiterated that Rahami has no rights within the federal system until he formally appears in court, which underscores the complexities associated with navigating state and federal legal systems concurrently. As Rahami's case unfolds, it is poised to draw significant public attention given the severe nature of the accusations and the backdrop of the police shootout.

The developments surrounding Ahmad Khan Rahami's case will be closely monitored, as they may set important precedents concerning the intersection of state and federal law. The legal representatives of Rahami are expected to continue advocating for their client’s rights and pushing for an expedited process that addresses the charges against him. 

In the coming days, as Rahami transitions into federal custody, the legal community and the public will be awaiting updates on how his case will be prosecuted moving forward. His situation exemplifies the challenges faced by individuals navigating the criminal justice system, particularly in cases involving serious offenses that implicate multiple judicial jurisdictions. The coming weeks promise to reveal more about Rahami's legal battles and the broader implications of his case.",-21.0,-26.0,597.0,-1.05,-0.035175879396984924,565.0,-1.2380952380952381,-0.04601769911504425
Real_7-Webpage,Donald Trump's rise puts Ted Cruz in a bind,"Story highlights Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump earlier this year, but is under pressure to change his mind now

Cruz could face a primary challenge in 2018 from a fellow Republican

Washington (CNN) Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said.

JUST WATCHED Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife 01:51

On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them.""

Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

The urgency escalates as the election draws near, with Representative Trent Franks publicly urging Cruz to support Trump. Franks argues that failing to back the Republican nominee could inadvertently bolster Hillary Clinton’s chances in the upcoming election and potentially undermine the Constitution.

Supporters of Cruz present a contrasting viewpoint, suggesting that an endorsement of Trump may alienate constituents who oppose him. This internal conflict showcases the complexities within the Republican Party as it approaches the election. Steve Deace, a prominent Cruz backer, has articulated concerns about the implications of an endorsement, noting that Cruz could violate his own principles by aligning with Trump. 

As the election approaches, time is of the essence. With less than two months remaining, Trump’s campaign is eager to secure additional support, especially as polls indicate a tight race with Clinton.

Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks.

The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe.

“Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.”

Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.”

“They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”

In a series of pointed comments, Donald Trump urged for a significant change in the U.S. approach to fighting the Islamic State, taking aim at the policies of former President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump's criticisms come on the heels of recent violent incidents, including bombings in New York and New Jersey and a stabbing in Minnesota, which have intensified concerns regarding potential terrorist threats.

Through a tweet, Trump attacked Clinton, labeling her ""Crooked Hillary"" and mocking her long-standing involvement in combating ISIS. He questioned the efficacy of her ""new ideas,"" suggesting that her tenure has failed to address the rising dangers posed by terrorism.

At the core of Trump’s argument lies a vehement criticism of both Obama and Clinton for their reluctance to use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."" Trump contends that this omission has emboldened terrorist organizations, allowing them to flourish unchecked. He emphasized that Clinton continues to deflect responsibility for the failures of her time as Secretary of State, undermining the bipartisan consensus needed to effectively combat terrorism.

In a stark warning, Trump posited that terrorists would favor Clinton's presidency as it would enable them to perpetuate their violent agenda. He assured supporters that, under his leadership, he would work to eradicate ""senseless acts of violence"" and denounced the current administration’s strategy against ISIS as little more than a “narrative fight.”

Pointing to the very real threats posed by terrorists, Trump maintained that they embody an existential threat to the United States and its core values. His comments reflect not only a campaign strategy but an urgent call for a more aggressive and comprehensive stance on national security.",-41.0,-36.0,328.0,-5.125,-0.125,332.0,-3.6,-0.10843373493975904
Real_71-Webpage,Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible',"Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.

Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.

Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""

On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""

""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.

A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.

""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.

Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.

Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.

This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.

Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.

Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.

Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.

On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.

Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""

Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.

""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.

Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.

Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.

All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.

On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.

""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.

A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.

Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""

Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.

Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.

Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.

In a dramatic unfolding of events during the ongoing trial related to the infamous ""Bridgegate"" scandal, former executives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, alongside key staff members from then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s administration, have found themselves at the center of a political maelstrom that involved a calculated effort to create traffic chaos at the George Washington Bridge. The lane closures executed in September 2013 were not merely a traffic control measure, but a politically motivated decision fueled by frustration over a lack of support from a local elected official.

At the heart of the testimony is David Wildstein, a former director at the Port Authority, who revealed disturbing insights about the thought processes that led to the controversial lane closures. Wildstein testified about crucial discussions that took place among him, Bridget Kelly, who served as Christie's deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority. Their motivations and strategic planning emerged from deep-seated political grievances, particularly concerning the lack of endorsement for Christie’s re-election by Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich.

Wildstein’s testimony pointed to a pivotal moment on August 13, 2013. Kelly, expressing her exasperation, sent an email to Wildstein stating, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" Wildstein's agreement to her suggestion marked a decisive turn in the plot to close access lanes to the busy bridge. This email exchange showcased a clear intent to leverage traffic congestion as a means of political retribution against Sokolich, who was perceived as an obstacle to Christie's political ambitions in the area.

The subsequent decisions made by Wildstein, Kelly, and Baroni were ominous. They proceeded with the lane closures without any prior notification to either the public or officials in Fort Lee. A ""radio silence"" policy was adopted, which mandated that all inquiries regarding the closures should be diverted to Baroni's office, renowned for its silence on the matter. This move aimed to maintain consistent inconvenience for Fort Lee residents, with the closures strategically scheduled to coincide with the first day of school on September 9—an unfortunate coincidence that further heightened tensions within the community.

Although there were initial plans to close all access lanes, safety considerations prompted Wildstein to modify the plan, ultimately settling on the unilateral closure of two lanes. On September 6, 2013, he informed the Port Authority staff of the impending closures under the pretense of conducting a traffic study. However, this narrative was compromised by a growing sense of unease expressed by Port Authority general manager Bob Durando, who raised concerns about the chaos that would ensue as a result of the lane reductions.

Despite these apprehensions, the closure proceeded, with Port Authority staff misled into believing that they were simply executing routine traffic studies. As traffic began to back up in unprecedented ways, Wildstein actively monitored the situation, conveying updates to Kelly, who reportedly found satisfaction in the escalating traffic issues plaguing Fort Lee. During the closures, a notable influx of calls emerged from Fort Lee officials desperate for information, but the coordinated plan of silence remained intact, ensuring that no explanation was provided to those most affected by the bottleneck.

Throughout these events, Wildstein characterized Baroni's role as aligning with Chris Christie's interests more than that of the agency or the residents affected by the lane closures. He indicated that both he and Baroni operated under what they referred to as the ""one constituent rule,"" where Christie's opinions took precedence over those of the many citizens relying on the Port Authority's services.

As the scandal escalated, the fallout was immense for those embroiled in the decision-making process. Both Kelly and Baroni now face serious conspiracy and fraud charges related to their roles in the incidents, and both have indicated plans to testify in their own defense. The implications of their testimonies, along with the revelations brought to light by Wildstein, could reshape public understanding of not only the Bridgegate affair but also the broader political landscape in New Jersey during Christie's governorship.

The ongoing legal ramifications serve as a stark reminder of the political maneuvers that can intersect with public safety and civic responsibility. As testimony continues and the repercussions of the lane closures unfold, both the public and legal observers will be left grappling with the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the actions of those in power. Whether the political motivations were justified or simply a reckless pursuit of advantage remains to be seen, but the unfolding drama promises to keep the spotlight on the actions and accountability of elected officials and their staff.

In what began as an apparently strategic maneuver situated within the political playbook, the Bridgegate scandal now stands as a significant case study of the blurred lines between governance and personal ambition. The divergent paths of those involved show a community divided by decisions made behind closed doors, far removed from the best interests of residents who depend on reliable infrastructure. As the courtroom battles rage on, the lessons learned from this scandal will resonate with both current and future government officials tasked with ensuring that public service is prioritized above partisan politics. 

Across the board, the actions of the former Port Authority executives and Christie aides raise critical questions about transparency, accountability, and ethical governance. The ongoing inquiry into the motivations behind the lane closures during the Bridgegate scandal will likely leave a lasting legacy on the political landscape, prompting future leaders to reflect deeply on the implications of their decisions.",9.0,-13.0,1009.0,0.225,0.008919722497522299,1036.0,-0.40625,-0.012548262548262547

It's living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state

(CNN) Florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the November election.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched.

The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.

Real_74-Webpage,HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night’s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Here’s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday’s debate? — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet’s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

There’s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night’s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins aren’t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

@HuffingtonPost someone’s upset that #Trumpwins — Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? — Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn’t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate – except for the little watched @CNN poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, “Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN’s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.” They actually looks like they’re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

A recent CNN/ORC poll reveals a significant majority of respondents, 62%, believe Hillary Clinton emerged victorious in the latest debate. This finding, however, stands in stark contrast to various online polls, which suggest that Donald Trump won by a significant margin. The discrepancy has prompted a closer examination of the reliability and methods behind these different polling approaches.

While polls conducted by established news organizations like CNN employ rigorous methodologies that involve direct contact with respondents, many online polls have been described as less reliable. The Huffington Post has been vocal in critiquing these online polls, labeling them as ""meaningless"" compared to CNN’s systematic approach. This sentiment underscores a broader concern regarding the manipulation of online polling results.

A key issue lies in the ease with which online polls can be influenced. Users from platforms such as 4chan and Reddit are known to rally to sway outcomes in their favor, leading to questions about the validity of such polls. Despite this, many Trump supporters have voiced their anger on Twitter in response to the Huffington Post's dismissal of their favored outcomes, highlighting the growing tension around polling discussions.

Donald Trump himself appears to actively engage with this debate by partisan endorsement of online polls that paint him in a favorable light, while simultaneously dismissing those that suggest he is losing. This selective acceptance of polling results has become a hallmark of Trump’s public persona. He confidently asserts that he has triumphed in every debate poll except for CNN's, a distinction that reflects his tendency to promote information aligning with his narrative while disregarding contradicting findings.

Further complicating the conversation, Trump has circulated an article that questions the credibility of the CNN poll results, pointing to the overwhelming support he claims from online polls. This behavior exemplifies how the debate surrounding poll results can be shaped by individual preferences and affiliations, leading to a polarized interpretation of data.

In the face of fierce online narratives and partisan polling, the data suggests an unequivocal conclusion: the majority of respondents believe Hillary Clinton won the debate. Nevertheless, the influence of online platforms and the strategic promotion of selected polls by political figures like Trump illustrate the complexities inherent in public perception and debate outcomes.

As conversations surrounding the recent debate continue, the contrasting results from traditional and online polling reveal a divided landscape where perceptions are often dictated by partisan interpretation. The core question remains—how do we discern the true winner in a contest marked by varying polling methodologies and highly engaged audience reactions? As the aftermath of the debate unfolds, it is clear that the lines between fact and opinion are increasingly blurred in the age of social media-driven dialogue and dissent.",35.0,34.0,556.0,1.75,0.06294964028776978,509.0,1.7894736842105263,0.06679764243614932
Real_75-Webpage,Tim Kaine on Libertarian ticket: 'Everybody knows they're not going to win',"Story highlights Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine says third-party Libertarian candidates will lose

He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson

(CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose.

""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week.

Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history.

""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. It may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. That's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history.""

Real_76-Webpage,Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s Vice President Joe Biden.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday’s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

“This is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?”

Adding:

“Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

“He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘You’re fired.’ They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

“He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

“If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord… What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.”

And it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Watch Biden lay into Trump here:

PHILADELPHIA — Vice President Joe Biden delivered a powerful critique of Donald Trump during a campaign stop here in support of Hillary Clinton, sharply questioning the Republican candidate's recent debate remarks about the housing market. Biden's comments came as part of a broader effort to rally support for Clinton ahead of the upcoming election, where voters are faced with a stark choice for the future of the country.

At the heart of Biden's address was a disbelief in Trump’s perspective that the failure of the housing market could be seen as advantageous. He expressed astonishment at Trump’s statements, highlighting a fundamental difference in values between the two candidates. “It simply baffles me,” Biden remarked, emphasizing his point that past presidents, regardless of party affiliation, demonstrated a commitment to a moral center founded on American values and rights.

Biden argued that Trump’s lack of traditional political sensibilities reflects a deeper problem, citing the billionaire’s apparent enjoyment in firing individuals and profiting from their misfortunes. This attitude, he suggested, signifies a departure from the empathy and concern expected from American leaders. He contended that Trump's approach undermines the dignity of hard-working Americans who face daily struggles.

The Vice President did not hold back when addressing Trump’s prideful admission of not paying taxes, contrasting this with the burdens many Americans endure just to meet their tax obligations. “The idea that not paying taxes is some sort of badge of honor is infuriating,” Biden said. He urged the audience to recognize the implications of such a mindset, especially for those who work tirelessly but still find themselves financially stretched.

As Biden recounted the experiences of everyday citizens, he took a definitive stance in favor of Hillary Clinton, asserting that the decision regarding the next Commander-in-Chief is crystal clear. He emphasized the need for a leader who understands the struggles of the American people and operates with integrity, values that he believes Trump fundamentally lacks.

Biden’s remarks also touched on what he described as Trump’s cynical outlook toward the American populace during his campaign. This characterization aligns with Biden’s broader message that America deserves a leader who embodies hope and responsibility, rather than one who appears dismissive and self-serving.

This campaign stop underscores not only Biden's commitment to Clinton’s candidacy but also his determination to shape the narrative surrounding Trump’s campaign. As the election approaches, Biden’s poignant critiques serve as a rallying cry for supporters to consider what kind of leadership they want for the future of the country.

With these remarks, Biden aimed to ensure that the conversation remains focused on the values that matter most to Americans, urging voters to choose wisely when they go to the polls this November.",3.0,5.0,496.0,0.17647058823529413,0.006048387096774193,529.0,0.2777777777777778,0.00945179584120983

At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday.

The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.

Story Continued Below

The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.

The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.

""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""

In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.

“This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) inspector general has disclosed alarming findings indicating that at least 858 individuals, who were ordered deported, were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship. This troubling error highlights significant flaws within the agency's record-keeping systems, raising concerns about the integrity of citizenship processes.

According to the report, the errors stemmed from incomplete records in the DHS's digital fingerprint repository as well as in the FBI’s fingerprint repository. Notably, paper fingerprint cards used prior to 2008 were inconsistently digitized, which further contributed to these record gaps. Additionally, the FBI did not always receive fingerprint data linked to immigration enforcement activities. The failure to properly document and transfer this critical information has led to additional complications and inconsistencies in tracking individuals' immigration statuses.

The inspector general specified that those who were granted citizenship under these circumstances are only ""potentially"" ineligible, suggesting that not all cases represent individuals who were incorrectly awarded citizenship. As part of the corrective measures, DHS is currently addressing the incomplete fingerprint records; however, the extent to which these records impact the citizenship of applicants varies significantly. Notably, not all individuals with incomplete records were granted citizenship, and some cases indicate that naturalization could have been denied had the proper records been accounted for.

Alarmingly, the investigation uncovered instances where three previously-deported individuals were granted citizenship and subsequently obtained security clearance for sensitive positions. Following the revelation of their immigration statuses, however, their credentials have now been revoked, underscoring the potential security risks posed by such oversights.

Inspector General John Roth expressed concerns regarding the implications of these findings, particularly the opportunity for potential fraud in the U.S. citizenship acquisition process. The report emphasizes the critical need for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to have access to comprehensive and accurate fingerprint records to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized citizenship claims and ensure the integrity of the citizenship process.

As discussions regarding immigration policy heat up, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump articulated his stance on the matter, making strict immigration vetting a cornerstone of his campaign. He has proposed potential bans and increased scrutiny based on national security concerns, adding urgency to the call for more meticulous immigration processes.

In light of these developments, DHS is under increased pressure to rectify the flaws within its fingerprint repository systems. The revelations from the inspector general's report not only raise questions about individual cases of citizenship but also about the overarching efficacy and security of America's immigration system. 

The need for robust measures to prevent similar issues in the future cannot be overstated. As the integrity of the immigration system faces scrutiny, it remains crucial for agencies like DHS and USCIS to implement stringent safeguards to uphold the standards of citizenship and ensure that such discrepancies do not recur. With potential implications for those currently navigating the citizenship process, the ongoing investigations and corrective actions will be closely monitored by stakeholders at all levels of government and across the public domain.",-16.0,-6.0,559.0,-1.0,-0.028622540250447227,568.0,-0.2857142857142857,-0.01056338028169014
Real_78-Webpage,Insiders: The heat is on Hillary,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.

Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.

Story Continued Below

That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.

“She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,” said a Nevada Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.”

“The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,” a New Hampshire Democrat added. “Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.”

One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.

“Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the Ohio Democrat. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.”

Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.

“Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an Ohio Republican. “Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.”

“She has to stop [Trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a Virginia Republican. “All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.”

Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans — most pointed to the GOP nominee’s volatile personality.

“Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,” said a Michigan Republican. “The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.”

“The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?” added a Michigan Democrat. “Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?”

Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:

Most insiders expect Clinton to “win” the debate.

Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

“Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,” said an Iowa Republican.

“[Clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a New Hampshire Democrat.

But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.

“The press wants Trump to win,” said a Florida Democrat. “Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.”

Some Republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction.

“The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,” a Virginia Republican said. “But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.”

Insiders think the debate will matter.

Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.

Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle.

“Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a Michigan Democrat predicted. “The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.”

The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact.

“Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.”

But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump’s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.

“If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an Iowa Republican. “If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.”

Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.

“We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,” an Iowa Republican said. “Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.”

Added a Florida Democrat: “Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.”

As Hillary Clinton prepares for her first debate with Donald Trump, the stakes have never been higher. Recent developments indicate that Clinton's lead is diminishing, heightening the pressure surrounding her performance. According to a POLITICO Caucus survey, an overwhelming 69% of Democrats and 74% of Republicans believe that Clinton is under more pressure than Trump heading into this critical matchup.

This sentiment reflects a broader concern among Democrats who criticize what they perceive as the low expectations set for Trump, a candidate frequently described as a political novice lacking a comprehensive understanding of key issues. While Trump simply needs to avoid significant gaffes during the debate, Clinton is viewed as needing a commanding performance to reassure voters of her qualifications for the presidency.

The contrasting expectations draw attention to what many insiders see as a double standard for Clinton. The pressures on her appear more pronounced, with broader expectations for her to deliver a flawless performance while also showcasing her likability. This scrutiny comes at a pivotal moment in her campaign, as Republicans openly acknowledge the mounting pressure she faces, particularly as the polls indicate a tightening race.

Insiders have expressed that this debate could serve as a critical juncture for Clinton’s campaign; however, a small percentage of insiders holds a different view. About 31% of Democrats and 26% of Republicans believe that Trump is under pressure, primarily due to his tendency for unpredictability. This split in perceptions of pressure highlights the complexities of the current political landscape.

Despite the overall pressures placed squarely on her shoulders, a significant number of insiders anticipate that Clinton will emerge as the victor in the debate. A substantial 76% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans believe Clinton will win the debate, signaling a consensus among many that she possesses the necessary capabilities to prevail.

Nevertheless, skepticism remains regarding the media's role in shaping perceptions of the debate's outcome. Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed concerns over potential media bias, which could influence how the public assesses the performances of each candidate. Such skepticism illustrates the contentious atmosphere surrounding the debate and signifies the potential for narratives to shift depending on the post-debate analyses.

Furthermore, the anticipated implications of the debate extend beyond immediate fallout. A majority of insiders predict that the debate will significantly impact the race in the coming weeks. Approximately 66% of Democrats believe Clinton's performance will be advantageous for her campaign, while 52% of Republicans think it will bolster Trump’s standing. These diverging expectations reflect a divided electorate, with each party hopeful for their candidate's success.

However, a lingering concern voiced by some insiders is related to the long-term effects that the debate may have. The prevailing sentiment suggests a shifting political dynamic, wherein the influence of debates on voter decisions has diminished compared to previous elections. Insiders are wary that even a standout performance may not yield the expected benefits, given the current trends in voter engagement and media consumption.

As both candidates prepare for this critical face-off, the debate is shaping up to be a defining moment in the election. With Clinton under considerable pressure to perform amid a narrowing lead, the stakes have never been higher. As the clock ticks down to the debate, all eyes will be on the candidates to see who will emerge victoriously and how their performances will weigh on the electorate in the days to come.",43.0,8.0,2576.0,0.8431372549019608,0.016692546583850932,647.0,0.3076923076923077,0.012364760432766615
Real_79-Webpage,Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

In a recent commentary, Frank Wilkenmeyer voiced his criticism of Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, labeling their social media presence as ""dimwitted."" Wilkenmeyer’s scathing remarks drew attention to how the Trump brothers have handled their public image in the digital arena, highlighting specific instances that he found particularly laughable.

One such instance was Eric Trump's recent exuberance over being featured in a crossword puzzle, a moment of self-admiration that struck Wilkenmeyer as emblematic of an underlying triviality in how the Trump brothers present themselves to their followers. The author mused on the broader implications of this behavior, suggesting that, with the upcoming elections, there is a possibility that the Trump brothers may fade from the public's attention, signaling an overdue departure from the political spotlight.

The critique extended further with a focus on a tweet from Donald Trump Jr., which took aim at Colin Kaepernick’s protests during the National Anthem. The tweet ignited a fiery discussion surrounding the rights of athletes to protest issues related to racial equality and the broader Black Lives Matter movement. Protests in sports have often drawn ire from conservative circles, with figures like Trump Jr. accusing these athletes of being unpatriotic and disrespectful to the troops.

Wilkenmeyer countered these accusations by asserting that the First Amendment safeguards the athletes' rights to express their opinions, regardless of the backlash they face. He highlighted that the ideological clash surrounding this issue often showcases a division in political thought, particularly between those who champion the First Amendment's protections and conservatives who predominantly emphasize the Second Amendment.

The author took care to contextualize the significance of the First Amendment, noting its historical foundation as a fundamental right that permits free expression. He criticized the common misconception that loyalty to one's country or its military requires suppression of personal beliefs and dissenting viewpoints. According to Wilkenmeyer, true patriotism encompasses a diversity of voices and the ability to engage in dialogue, even when opinions diverge sharply.

Moreover, Wilkenmeyer referenced landmark Supreme Court decisions that reinforce free speech rights, especially in contexts where compulsory civic practices are concerned. These legal precedents underline that the rights to criticize and protest are enshrined in the Constitution, challenging the narrative that equates patriotism with unwavering allegiance to any one practice or idea.

In an age where political discourse is increasingly polarized, Wilkenmeyer's discourse illustrates an ongoing struggle to reconcile the cultural and political landscapes that define modern America. He lamented what he sees as a selective interpretation of constitutional rights by conservatives, particularly regarding the First Amendment, when juxtaposed against their steadfast defense of gun rights under the Second Amendment.

As the commentary progressed, Wilkenmeyer's tone struck a blend of exasperation and amusement. The notion that the Trump brothers might be on the verge of extinction from the political scene was delivered with a wry chuckle, suggesting that perhaps the public's interest in their antics might finally be waning.

In conclusion, as discussions surrounding patriotism, protest, and public figures unfold in the lead-up to elections, Wilkenmeyer’s insights illuminate a significant divide in how constitutional rights are perceived and defended. His observations about the Trump brothers serve as a humorous yet pointed reminder of the power dynamics at play in contemporary America, all while calling for a broader recognition of free expression as a vital aspect of a functioning democracy.",-17.0,5.0,592.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.028716216216216218,638.0,0.25,0.007836990595611285
Real_8-Webpage,More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump! – Eagle Rising,"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.

The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category.

Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.

Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.

Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.

Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”. Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said.

Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”

In the rollercoaster ride of American politics, few figures embody the highs and lows quite like Donald Trump. Following the publication of “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week,” the landscape appears to have shifted dramatically in favor of the former president. Recent polling data indicates that Trump's support is on the rise, as he either leads or closely trails Hillary Clinton in several critical surveys. A snapshot of the latest numbers demonstrates this upward trajectory: a Fox News Poll shows Trump at 46% versus Clinton’s 45%, while the LA Times/USC Poll records Trump at 47% to Clinton’s 41%. The Suffolk University Poll further underscores this trend with Trump at 42% against Clinton's 39%. Notably, CNN's ORC Poll indicates that Trump has garnered a 4-point lead in the battleground state of Florida—a significant indicator as the race tightens.

Moreover, key battleground states previously thought to be favoring the Democrats are now witnessing narrowing gaps. States like Nevada and New Hampshire have remarkably shifted into the ""toss-up"" category, which has significant implications as both parties set their sights on these regions in anticipation of what will undoubtedly be a fiercely contested election. 

Amidst this resurgence, Trump has introduced a childcare policy aimed at addressing the needs of families across various economic levels. Drawing from the expertise of his daughter Ivanka Trump, the policy outlines several key components that resonate with many voters. Central to the proposal are initiatives for paid maternity leave, childcare rebates, tax deductions for childcare expenses, and the creation of Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs). These proposed measures not only reflect a tangible policy initiative aimed at working families but also attempt to broaden Trump's appeal among women and younger voters, groups traditionally less aligned with his brand.

Trump's long-awaited economics speech at the Economic Club of New York also contributed to his successful week. During this presentation, he elaborated on his economic policies and vision, positioning himself as a viable candidate for those concerned about fiscal management. The reception to the speech indicates that, at least in economic discussions, Trump is succeeding in projecting an image of competence and readiness to lead.

In a week that could be characterized by Trump’s engaging public persona, his appearance on the Dr. Oz Show was particularly noteworthy. On the program, he disclosed his medical history, a topic of increased public interest, particularly in the wake of concerns surrounding Hillary Clinton's health following her fainting incident earlier in the campaign. This timely disclosure allows Trump to contrast his physical condition against the backdrop of Clinton’s health struggles, subtly shifting the narrative in his favor.

Adding a lighter tone to the week, Trump visited The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, where he participated in comedic interactions. The highlight of the appearance featured Fallon styling Trump’s hair, which not only provided entertainment but also portrayed a more relatable side of the candidate. Such moments serve to soften Trump’s often confrontational public image and allow audiences a glimpse of his personality beyond the political arena.

In addition to his media appearances and policy initiatives, Trump recently opened a new hotel in Washington D.C., further solidifying his business acumen and brand presence. This move has not gone unnoticed by military leaders, who have offered their endorsements, providing an added layer of support that could appeal to voters concerned about national security. 

Moreover, during the week, Trump took the opportunity to address the long-debated ""birther issue."" In a clear and decisive statement, he asserted that Barack Obama was born in the United States. By tackling this controversial topic, Trump seeks to reclaim agency over a narrative that has lingered throughout his political career, aiming to dispel any lingering doubts about his stance and credibility. This forthrightness may resonate with those seeking honesty in political discourse.

Reflecting on Trump's ability to connect with audiences, it is evident that the former president has successfully harnessed various platforms to showcase his candidacy in a multifaceted manner. From serious policy discussions to light-hearted media appearances, Trump demonstrates an understanding of the diverse ways to engage voters. This week, Trump's mixture of humor, serious policy proposals, and counter-narrative strategies prove that he remains a formidable candidate in the political arena.

As the election season unfolds, one cannot overlook Trump's demonstrated capacity to leverage both his strengths and current events to his advantage. His rise in the polls, combined with strategic messaging and targeted policy initiatives, paints a compelling picture for supporters and a formidable challenge for opponents.

The next weeks and months will offer further insight into how these developments shape the political landscape, but for now, Trump's “amazing” week encapsulates his ongoing relevance and ability to navigate the tumultuous waters of American politics with remarkable dexterity. With each passing moment, it will be fascinating to see how this resurgence translates into broader support and whether the momentum can be sustained as the race to the presidency intensifies.",59.0,55.0,1240.0,1.2291666666666667,0.04758064516129032,953.0,1.6176470588235294,0.05771248688352571
Real_80-Webpage,Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground,"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.

Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.

He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.

Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.

Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.

Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.

These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.

Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.

""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.

Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.

Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump.

""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.

Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.

Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""

The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.

Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.

TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.

This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.

""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""

Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""

Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""

""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""

This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.

Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.

In a significant shift in strategy, Donald Trump is sharpening his media focus, opting primarily to engage with Fox News while stringently avoiding other major news networks. This realignment aims at not only galvanizing his base but also creating a buffer from the often tougher scrutiny encountered in more typical media environments.

Trump has a lineup of anticipated appearances on Fox, which includes notable programs such as ""Fox & Friends,"" ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" and a town hall session with Sean Hannity. This concentrated focus on Fox News is indicative of a broader strategy designed to minimize exposure to challenging questions that could probe the vulnerabilities of his campaign. The backlash from journalists is palpable as they express frustration over the limitations placed on their ability to engage with the candidate directly.

Supporters in Trump’s camp assert that he is significantly more accessible than his political rival, Hillary Clinton. This assertion is currently being contested as Clinton has recently held multiple press conferences, engaging democratically with the press in a way that contrasts sharply with Trump's own media interaction— or lack thereof. Notably, Trump has not conducted a press conference since July, while Clinton has responded to queries from reporters multiple times just in the past fortnight, further illuminating the disparity in their media engagement.

Furthermore, tracking the timeline of Trump’s accessibility, reporters have highlighted an alarming gap—over 50 days without a live press conference. Additionally, while Trump made appearances on shows like ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" these formats diverged significantly from what is typically expected in journalistic settings, leading to concerns and criticisms about the genuineness of the interactions he is willing to entertain.

Trump’s last interaction with CNN was marked by a pointed exchange with renowned journalist Anderson Cooper, who challenged Trump on several fronts, resulting in unfavorable feedback for the candidate. Since then, it seems Trump has consciously evaded interviews with more critical interrogators, effectively shying away from scrutinizing media that does not align with his preferred narrative.

Moreover, a notable aspect of Trump’s evolving strategy is the apparent cessation of informal interviews with reporters at his rally events. This shift signifies a broader decline in his media accessibility since the inception of his campaign. Experts argue that this tactical maneuvering allows Trump to shield himself from aggressive journalism while still delivering messages directly to a conservative audience, effectively reinforcing his narrative without contest.

This exclusive pivot towards Fox News has not gone unnoticed, with public figures drawing attention to the questionably limited diversity of his interview settings. By placing all his focus on Fox, Trump enters into an echo chamber where the challenges of oppositional reporting are significantly minimized, raising concerns about the overall health of media literacy within his base and the wider electorate.

Particularly illustrative of Trump's strategy is his relationship with Sean Hannity, which serves as a testament to the careful control he seeks to exercise over his messaging. The upcoming discussions on Hannity’s show promise to touch upon pressing issues affecting the African-American community, despite the demographic showing notably low viewership within the Fox News audience. This move could be perceived as an attempt to broaden his appeal, albeit within the confines of a sympathetic platform.

In sum, Donald Trump's recent media strategy appears to be a calculated attempt to rally his supporters while simultaneously guarding himself against critical scrutiny. The tightrope walk he performs between accessibility and control is emblematic of both the challenges he faces as a candidate and the broader implications for political discourse in an increasingly fractured media landscape. With a focus on platforms that cater to his base, Trump may be sacrificing the broader engagement that is often required in a democratic process, a decision that could have long-ranging effects as the campaign progresses and the public continues to call for transparency and accessibility from their leaders.",15.0,18.0,918.0,0.35714285714285715,0.016339869281045753,731.0,0.782608695652174,0.024623803009575923

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.""

Pence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.

Real_82-Webpage,Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.

The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

New Jersey State Police

A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.

Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.

One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.

Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

New Jersey State Police

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.

""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""

Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.

Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

New Jersey State Police

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.

Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.

Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.

A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old man captured in Linden, New Jersey, has come under scrutiny as authorities question his involvement with a series of explosive devices that were recently discovered in New York City and New Jersey. His legal troubles mark a harrowing transformation from the community cook to a suspect linked to serious criminal activity.

Rahami was born in Afghanistan in 1988 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen after his family immigrated to the United States in 1995. Growing up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, he became an integral part of the local fabric, working at his family-owned fried chicken restaurant. Patrons and locals described him as friendly—a stark contrast to the serious allegations now facing him.

Described by former classmates as a quiet individual with a good sense of humor, Rahami's demeanor appeared to align with that of a ""pretty normal guy."" He attended Edison High School, where he not only pursued his education but also welcomed responsibilities of young adulthood, having a child with his high school girlfriend.

Following high school, Rahami enrolled at Middlesex County College from 2010 to 2012. He pursued an associate's degree in criminal justice but didn't complete his studies. This laid-back approach to education may have foreshadowed a series of turbulent life events that would lead him to the center of a major criminal investigation.

Despite his previous appearances as a friendly and approachable local, Rahami's family has had a contentious history with law enforcement. In 2011, they filed a lawsuit against local police, alleging harassment, although the case was dismissed in 2012. This backdrop of tension with authorities might have influenced Rahami’s trajectory leading to his recent arrest.

Investigators are delving deeply into Rahami's past, specifically examining his travel history. Notably, he took a nearly year-long trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan, spanning from April 2013 to March 2014. This international travel raises significant questions regarding potential influences or connections he may have encountered during that period.

Rahami's brush with the law prior to his current charges began in August 2014, when he was arrested following an alleged stabbing incident. However, no indictment ever followed, and the case slipped into the shadows of his history, potentially overshadowed by the more recent and serious accusations against him.

The tide turned dramatically for Rahami when a shootout with police led to his capture. During this confrontation in Linden, he sustained injuries after exchanging fire with law enforcement. Subsequently, he was transported to a hospital for treatment. Upon recovery, Rahami proved uncooperative with investigators, reportedly refusing to divulge even his name, complicating matters for law enforcement seeking to ascertain his motivations and connections.

As he now faces a litany of charges, including five counts of attempted murder and weapons possession, his bail has been set at a staggering $5.2 million. The significant bail amount reflects the seriousness of his alleged offenses and the sentiments of apprehension resonating throughout the community.

Additionally, this case has drawn attention from international entities. The Afghan government has expressed its willingness to assist U.S. authorities in relation to Rahami, signaling a potential avenue for cooperation regarding the investigation into his background and any potential international ties.

Rahami’s evolution from a relatively normal young man to a suspect ensnared in a web of violence and potential terrorism raises profound questions about the influences that might have contributed to this drastic transformation. As local authorities and federal investigators sift through the details of Rahami's life, many in the community are left grappling with the reality that someone they once knew as an everyday figure may have been involved in something far darker.

As the investigation progresses, Rahami's story serves as a chilling reminder of how ordinary lives can sometimes unravel into extraordinary horrors. In the wake of his capture, the search for answers continues, not only regarding his actions but also the broader implications of his life leading up to the incidents that have now captured nationwide attention.",-17.0,-27.0,735.0,-0.53125,-0.02312925170068027,749.0,-0.9,-0.036048064085447265
Real_83-Webpage,Trump’s puzzling pitch to black voters,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

“The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

“We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.

But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night.

“I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”

Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach.

“I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?”

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

“Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

“I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.”

Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.”

“The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.”

Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.

“They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”

In an unprecedented move, former President Donald Trump held a campaign event at a church in a historically African-American neighborhood, signaling his intent to engage with urban America’s pressing issues. The event, part of his strategy to bolster support among black voters, served as a platform for Trump to address concerns while facing criticism from various quarters regarding his policies and past remarks.

At the forefront of his speech was the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policing policy, which Trump proposed to expand. This approach has faced significant backlash due to allegations of racial profiling, particularly within black communities. Despite its contentious nature, Trump argued that the policy had been effective during its implementation in New York City, insisting that it curtailed crime rates. This defense did little to sway his critics, particularly civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, who voiced strong discontent over the proposal and its implications for racial justice.

Trump’s campaign trail has been marked by a concerted effort to mitigate the accusations of racism that have dogged him since his initial foray into politics. As he stood before both black and white audiences, he noted the deterioration of conditions within black communities, a statement he used to frame his proposed solutions. However, his remarks were met with skepticism, as many interpreted them as yet another instance of detachment from the realities faced by those in urban areas.

A notable moment of the event featured former boxing promoter Don King, who took the stage to introduce Trump. King, known for his own share of controversies, labeled Trump a “gladiator” capable of confronting the entrenched political system. This endorsement from King, a prominent figure in the African-American community, was both aimed at rallying support and acknowledging Trump’s unusual efforts to connect with black voters.

Despite making strides to surround himself with a more diverse group of advisers, Trump’s outreach efforts seemed to intersect with an underlying strategy to reshape white voters' perceptions. His approval rating among African-American voters remains dismally low, and some political analysts speculate that his engagements are as much about enhancing his image among whites as they are about genuine outreach to black communities.

The recent event also saw Trump criticize the actions of a police officer in the shooting of an unarmed black man. This statement is somewhat striking, particularly given Trump's traditional strongman stance supporting law enforcement. It demonstrates an attempt to tap into the ongoing national conversation regarding police reform and accountability, even as he simultaneously endorses policies like “stop-and-frisk” that many argue undermine trust in law enforcement within black communities.

Throughout his address, Trump’s attorney, Michael Cohen, defended his boss against accusations of racism, emphasizing that Trump views all races as part of a unified human race. This assertion attempts to counter the perception of his presidency as one rife with racially charged rhetoric and policies. However, such defenses often ring hollow to critics, who cite specific examples from Trump’s past that contribute to ongoing concerns over his racial sensitivities.

Trump took a more sweeping approach in his critique of the Democratic party, claiming that they had effectively abandoned black voters after securing their support in elections. This charge is emblematic of Trump’s broader strategy to position himself as a savior for disillusioned urban communities, portraying the Democratic party as neglectful and unresponsive to the needs of its constituents.

Despite the challenges he faces in repairing his relationship with African-American voters, Trump's proactive steps to engage with black communities are poised to influence both his campaign and the broader political landscape. The combination of proposing policies, defending controversial policing methods, and positioning himself in opposition to traditional Democratic narratives underscores a complex strategy aimed at revitalizing his standing among a significant demographic, even as the skepticism surrounding his motives persists.

In conclusion, as Donald Trump continues his campaign, the intersections of race, policy, and community engagement will play a crucial role in shaping public perception of his candidacy and the discourse regarding African-American issues in America today. The balance he seeks to strike between asserting support for law enforcement and advocating for civil rights will be closely scrutinized by both supporters and detractors alike. As the political landscape evolves, Trump's attempts to redefine his relationship with black voters will undoubtedly shape the dynamics of the coming election cycle.",-67.0,-6.0,1178.0,-1.8108108108108107,-0.056876061120543296,821.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.007308160779537149

Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged.

“If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.”

Story Continued Below

Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.”

Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.

But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.”

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.”

Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.

Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.

“I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.”

He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.

“I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.

Controversial former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his staunch support of former President Donald Trump, recently weighed in on Trump's acknowledgment of Barack Obama’s birthplace. This development has reignited discussions surrounding the ""birther"" movement, a controversial topic that has polarized opinions over the years.

During recent commentary, Arpaio highlighted that while Trump has acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States, he notably did not label Obama's birth certificate as ""legitimate."" Arpaio perceives this nuance as a silver lining for the birther movement, suggesting there is still room for skepticism. ""If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio remarked, pointing out the lack of definitive support for the legitimacy of the birth certificate itself.

Despite the evolving narrative, Arpaio stated that Trump’s acknowledgment of Obama’s birthplace “didn’t bother me.” This positions Arpaio as somewhat indifferent to the latest developments, maintaining his focus on the ongoing investigation into the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate—a pursuit he initiated back in August 2011 after the document surfaced online.

Trump originally gained significant political traction through insinuations that Obama was not born in the United States, claims that have widely faced criticism as racially charged and unfounded. Recently, Trump attempted to downplay the birther issue while deflecting blame to Hillary Clinton, alleging that she was the one who started the rumor. This assertion, however, has been thoroughly debunked by fact-checkers.

Arpaio, who has become a prominent figure in discussions about Obama’s birth certificate, confirmed that his investigation, spurred by a conservative group, continues to delve into whether the birth certificate is forged. As of now, he stated that the ongoing investigation has uncovered no evidence proving the document's legitimacy. 

Importantly, Arpaio emphasized that his involvement in this matter does not connect him to the broader birther movement. He clarified that his focus remains strictly on the authenticity of the document, rather than the president's birthplace. In a bid to distance himself from accusations of racial motivations behind his inquiry, Arpaio asserted, “I have no idea now where he was born,” reflecting a level of uncertainty regarding the matter that complicates the narrative around his investigation.

Furthermore, in a fascinating twist, Arpaio acknowledged that he was unaware of Trump’s recent statement regarding Obama’s birthplace prior to the press conference in which he made his comments. This lack of foreknowledge raises questions about the current alignment of rhetoric concerning birth certificate issues between Arpaio and Trump.

As discussions around Trump, Obama, and the contentious birther movement continue, Arpaio’s remarks serve as a reminder of the enduring complexities surrounding this highly charged political issue. With his ongoing investigation and thoughts about Trump's latest acknowledgment, Arpaio remains a figure at the intersection of law enforcement, politics, and the controversial legacy of birtherism in the United States.",-9.0,-17.0,533.0,-0.5625,-0.016885553470919325,575.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.029565217391304348
Real_85-Webpage,Barack Obama at Benjamin Netanyahu meeting: 'He is always very candid with us',"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month

His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office.

Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency.

""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us.""

That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January.

Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

Despite the personal tensions that have emerged over the years, Obama expressed his commitment to maintaining a robust and positive relationship with Israel as he prepares to transition power. The president seeks to leave strong ties for his successor, ensuring a continuity of support for the Middle Eastern nation.

As the meeting took place, Obama is also actively campaigning for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the upcoming presidential election, hoping to solidify the groundwork for a cooperative relationship between the United States and Israel during the next administration.

This final engagement between Obama and Netanyahu highlights the ongoing challenges in the quest for peace, with both leaders recognizing the need for understanding and collaboration in the face of regional uncertainties. As their partnership draws to a close, the dialogue signifies not just an ending, but also an opportunity for future administrations to continue building on the foundations laid during Obama’s time in office.",25.0,31.0,300.0,2.7777777777777777,0.08333333333333333,286.0,3.4444444444444446,0.10839160839160839
Real_86-Webpage,McAuliffe hangs with Willie Nelson -- and his weed,"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana

Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert

(CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed.

It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!""

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is.

""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool.""

The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

Real_87-Webpage,The Mystery of Trump’s Man in Moscow: Carter Page,"In March, in a bold “Oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the Washington Post’s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, “I have quite a few more.” The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “Carter Page, PhD.”

Who?

Story Continued Below

Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.”

This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.

“What’s this guy’s name?” says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.

“I had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. “But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘Have you heard of this guy?’”

“Strangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,” Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. “It's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.”

Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.

This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. “I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.” As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?

Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (“I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’” says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump’s own campaign.

What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. “He’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,” says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia’s state oil giant. “People really respect him in this industry. He’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials—including Rosneft head Igor Sechin—during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.

Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at Gazprom,” the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in Russia” and an office “around the corner from Trump Tower.”

Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, “Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a “famous American economist” and “adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.”

All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in Trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.

But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to Page’s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.

So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?

***

I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page’s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.

This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.

OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn’t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive résumé.

Page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. “He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,” his bio reads. “He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.”

Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page’s tenure in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.

So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn’t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “I don’t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says Craig . “It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.”

When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page’s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, “I rolled my eyes at that one.” (He, too, said he hadn’t heard of Page until Trump’s announcement.)

Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?

Turns out, they did.

“His nickname was stranichkin,” from the Russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. “It really irritated our team,” Torchinsky told me over Skype. “We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. These guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” As for Page, “He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” Torchinsky says. “When you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.”

OK, harsh. But then I talked to Page’s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. “He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me.

Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says Aleksashenko.

When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” And, says Aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.”

Trump’s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says Aleksashenko.

***

For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,” he wrote. “Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (“Slave; Pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.

His speech in Moscow’s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “For the last 15 years, I’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak Russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: “We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.” Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.

Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. “He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “That blog post about the slaves. That’s just … strange,” says the Council member.

“He’s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. “You’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.”

***

I should’ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump’s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.

I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page’s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?

But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch’s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “No one let him into Gazprom,” Aleksashenko says. “He didn’t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller’s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.” Another of Page’s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page’s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year… I used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.”

But the meetings did provide him with something else. “Gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them.

After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father’s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from Trump Tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space.

“That’s Carter Page,” says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. “That’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. He’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.”

In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia’s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“I don’t know this person,” said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page’s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. “I give them money, I don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,” he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “Don’t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.”

“You are engaged in onanism,” said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. “It’s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It’s absurd.”

As for the FBI investigation, well, it’s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.” He added, “the story doesn't add up.” What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page’s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.”

***

I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?

“Who?” says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.

“He has no formal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.

Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks’s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?

One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.

One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump’s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,” Burt told me. “And I told him I’d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I’ve forgotten. He’s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?”

Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump’s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. “If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,” this person told me.

“I’m not answering your questions,” Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “Carter Page isn’t someone I’ve interacted with.” Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: “Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He’s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.”

***

Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“Who?” Maybe I wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.

“I don’t know about his Russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. “Every conversation I’ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” He went on. “I couldn’t name a project that I could connect Carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.”

“I don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but I think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.”

Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, “a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ‘I want to be part of the team,’” says the Trump adviser. And that’s how it happened. “He’s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ‘He’s an adviser.’ And now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.”

Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,” one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,” the Russia specialist recalls. “He didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.”

According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page’s trip to Russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.” But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “It’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America’s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It’s what’s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carré novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?”

This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “If Page using his status as ‘Trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: “Carter Page, Ph.D.” Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.

For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?

There doesn’t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,” Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.

**Introduction**

In March, the political landscape was shifted when former President Donald Trump disclosed a shortlist of foreign policy advisers during an interview with the Washington Post. Among those named was Carter Page, a figure whose involvement in energy policy and alleged connections to Russia would soon engulf him in controversy. Described as the founder and managing partner of Global Energy Capital, Page portrayed himself as someone with significant experience in the Russian energy sector. However, as his profile rose following Trump's announcement, scrutiny of Page intensified, revealing a narrative wrought with questions of credibility, influence, and geopolitics.

**Carter Page: A Brief Profile**

Carter Page emerged as a key figure in Trump's circle, especially in areas concerning energy policy and Russian relations. His assertion of extensive experience in the Russian energy sector raised eyebrows, especially given the mixed reception among industry professionals. Many Western businessmen operating in Russia reportedly had not heard of Page prior to his newfound media attention, leading to skepticism regarding his qualifications and networks within the critical energy field.

Before his association with Trump, Page held a vice president position at the global financial services firm, Merrill Lynch. This, however, was not without its own controversies, as former colleagues disputed the nature and significance of his contributions and connections. Page's career trajectory, while circularly linked to finance and energy, did not indicate a seamless rise to the status he now claimed in foreign policy.

**Trump's Decision and Page's Role**

Trump's decision to enlist Page as a foreign policy adviser was reflective of the former president's broader approach during his candidacy, marked by a willingness to surround himself with unconventional figures. The revelation drew both attention and criticism; Page became a symbol of the unpredictable nature of Trump's advisory team. 

Despite Page's claims of possessing energy expertise, the industry sector largely viewed him as unqualified. This perception lingered beneath the surface of his rising profile. Aggressive media coverage transformed Page from a relatively unknown figure into one with considerable attention, albeit characterized more by skepticism than by respect from established professionals in energy and foreign policy.

**The Investigation and Media Scrutiny**

As the landscape shifted around Page, reports emerged indicating that U.S. intelligence agencies were investigating him for his alleged ties to Russian leaders. This claim only heightened the intrigue surrounding his role within the Trump campaign and raised concerns about his influence over U.S. energy policies and engagements with Russia. Intriguingly, his interactions in Moscow, which were portrayed in the media as significant, may not have indicated the level of foreign policy influence that was assumed. Instead, ambiguous evidence around his networking raised questions about Page’s true role within these elite circles.

Legal experts and political analysts began to piece together the potential ramifications of Page's dealings. The investigation surrounding him was complicated by the uncertainty about his actual influence and connections. Page, who attempted to align himself with the idea of being a foreign policy expert, found his writings and statements drawing criticism for their lack of coherence and depth.

**Public Perception and Implications for National Security**

The public narrative concerning Page shifted dramatically from one of potential expert advisory to that of an enigmatic figure clouded in allegations and questions. Critics were quick to argue that Trump's lack of experience in foreign policy has left vulnerabilities for manipulation and misinformation, drawing attention to the credibility of his advisers. Trump's reliance on Page, primarily due to a lack of established foreign policy experts within his eclectic team, caused alarm among circles that prioritize national security and diplomatic accountability.

Importantly, Page’s ascension was closely tied to his strategic positioning as an ally to Trump, allowing him to generate a curiosity that was disproportionate to his qualifications. Despite being largely seen as unqualified within the realm of foreign affairs, Page benefited immensely from his association with a high-profile figure like Trump. 

**Conclusion**

Carter Page's story encapsulates the ubiquity and complexity of emerging figures within the political landscape, especially under an administration characterized by a break from traditional governance norms. As investigations unfold and the implications of his dealings with Russian individuals come to the forefront, Page's past associations and present credibility remain focal points of a broader discourse on U.S. national security. The ongoing scrutiny raises essential questions not only about the individuals who shape foreign policy but also about the systems that allow for the ascendance of those seemingly unqualified to do so. As the narrative continues to unravel, the intersection of politics, intelligence, and governance remains crucial in understanding the impact on both national and global stages.",27.0,-13.0,6589.0,0.12796208530805686,0.004097738655334649,896.0,-0.41935483870967744,-0.014508928571428572
Real_88-Webpage,It’s “Trump is HITLER” Month at the Washington Post – Eagle Rising,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post.

On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part,

(…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is.

Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

Six Day’s before Mr. Cohen, another columnist Shalom Auslander wrote, “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles…

The Washington Post has come under fire for perceived biased reporting against former President Donald Trump. Critics have pointed to the newspaper’s allocation of 20 reporters to investigate Trump, raising questions about the impartiality of their coverage. Notably, columnists at the Post have drawn strong and controversial comparisons between Trump and Adolf Hitler, prompting backlash from readers and media commentators alike.

In a recent column, Richard Cohen labeled Trump as possessing a ""Hitlerian"" mindset regarding the truth, a characterization that many argue lacks balance. Cohen’s editorial has been particularly scrutinized, as he refrains from offering a similar comparison for Hillary Clinton, hinting at a narrative that critics deem selective and biased. This one-sided portrayal has fueled discussions on media integrity and fairness in reporting.

Conversely, columnist Shalom Auslander has warned against these comparisons to Hitler, suggesting that equating Trump with the notorious dictator diminishes the gravity of historical atrocities associated with the Holocaust. Auslander’s stance calls for a more measured discourse around Trump, emphasizing the potential harm in such provocative analogies.

Real_89-Webpage,Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore,"2016 Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore The president’s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.

They’re not laughing anymore.

Story Continued Below

Going into Monday night’s debate, Obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.

“I’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “I feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘Breaking Bad’ here. We’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.”

“There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,” said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.

Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He’s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare—support Democrats.

For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there’s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.

“We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. “But we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.”

Trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.

And the result: Trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama’s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.

Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.

“I don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, I don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.”

But they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama’s America.

“I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. “He’s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.”

For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “Trump has shattered that,” Vietor said. “He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. That’s a bad lesson for people to learn.”

According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton’s chances.

“I’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.

Not everyone’s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.

“He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.

And Democrats’ sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.

“The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,” said Earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.”

But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.

“I’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” Papa said, “than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”

As the 2016 election cycle escalates, a palpable sense of anxiety permeates the atmospheres surrounding former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's campaign team. Initially, aides in the Obama administration viewed Donald Trump's unexpected takeover of the Republican Party with a sense of amusement, but that laughter has transformed into serious concerns as Trump's appeal to a broader segment of America becomes increasingly evident.

This shift in sentiment represents a wider apprehension among political circles, as former White House aides liken the current situation to a drama series that has evolved into a more ominous narrative. The light-hearted observations about Trump's antics and the tumult within the GOP have given way to a mounting fear regarding the consequences of his influence. What was once viewed as entertainment is now a source of national anxiety over the future of American political discourse and the resilience of democratic ideals.

Privately, President Obama finds himself grappling with a complex emotional landscape. He feels a mix of amusement at the Republican Party's ongoing struggles, yet he is also frustrated by his own perceived shortcomings in connecting with certain demographic segments of the electorate. This ambivalence underscores the challenges of contemporary politics, where the electorate is deeply polarized and divided. 

Trump’s ascent serves as a stark reminder of the deep political divide in America—a divide that has only widened since Obama’s presidency. It raises questions about the effectiveness of the previous administration's efforts to bridge the gap with specific voter bases. As Obama reflects on this, his aides note that Trump's allure highlights perceived failures in reaching out to various citizen segments, a situation that contributes to the tension felt throughout the political landscape.

The potential normalization of divisive and racist rhetoric by Trump has alarmed those who once held influential roles within the Obama administration. His ability to mainstream such discourse, while also amassing a significant base of donor support, has prompted serious debates about the ramifications for American society. The implications of this trend extend beyond the immediate political climate; they threaten to reshape the very fabric of political engagement and discourse for years to come.

Polls, as election day approaches, reveal a tightly contested race between Trump and Clinton, upending the expectations that many in Obama's camp harbored. There was initial confidence that Clinton’s candidacy would present a robust challenge to Trump, yet the emerging reality of a competitive contest has prompted a re-evaluation of strategies and concerns about public sentiment. The unexpected tightening of the race casts doubt on the viability of long-held assumptions about party allegiance and voter behavior.

Amid these evolving dynamics, some Obama aides contend that Trump's impact should not tarnish the legacy of their former boss. They assert that the issues faced by the GOP are largely self-inflicted and that Trump's rise reflects broader failures within the party rather than an indictment of the accomplishments of the Obama administration. This perspective offers some solace to those who fear that the political narrative might unfairly overshadow the achievements made during Obama’s presidency.

However, the worry persists regarding the lasting damage Trump has inflicted on political discourse in the United States. His normalization of aggressive, low-blow tactics poses a critical question about the kind of political culture America wants to endorse moving forward. The concern is that such behavior will establish a precedent, leading future political contests to favor combativeness over constructive discourse. 

Obama has expressed a longing for a functional opposition party, lamenting the missed opportunities for collaborative governance that could have benefited Americans across the political spectrum. His vision of democracy is grounded in constructive engagement and the ability to find common ground, an aspiration that feels increasingly out of reach amidst the chaos of contemporary politics. The stark divide and the personal nature of attacks overshadow opportunities for genuine discussion and cooperation.

While there exists some optimism regarding the internal conflicts within the GOP and Trump's disruptive influence, it is overshadowed by significant concern for the overall state of American politics. Those within Obama’s circle acknowledge that the current landscape requires more than the mere presence of a competitive political environment; it necessitates a commitment to civility and accountability. The fear is that the legitimization of extremist views could further fracture the American political landscape, creating an environment in which ideological extremism gains unexpected traction.

As the nation stands on the brink of a pivotal election, it is clear that the implications of Trump's influence will resonate well beyond November. The desire for a functional and respectful political discourse remains a pressing imperative—one that embodies the aspirations of many who served during the Obama administration. They hope for a future where dialogue can replace division, and collaboration can once again be prioritized over conflict.

In conclusion, as concerns continue to rise regarding Trump's appeal to various voter demographics and the normalization of racially charged dialogue, it is crucial for political leaders and citizens alike to reflect on the current state of American politics. The trajectory that politics takes in the coming years will significantly shape the nation’s social fabric, sparking debates that hinge on civility versus aggression, inclusivity versus divisiveness. Amid these tensions, the voices of those who once navigated the complexities of governance during a different era serve as both a cautionary tale and a clarion call for the restoration of principles that prioritize constructive engagement and mutual respect.",-9.0,-3.0,1354.0,-0.24324324324324326,-0.0066469719350073855,1009.0,-0.08571428571428572,-0.002973240832507433

Real_90-Webpage,Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

“Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”

Adding:

“This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”

Chelsea then said:

“Stop telling women to smile. We don’t like that. It’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”

Going for Priebus’ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

“You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.”

And that’s exactly right.

In recent discussions surrounding gender dynamics, the expectation for women to smile has sparked significant backlash. A notable instance arose when Reince Priebus, Chair of the Republican National Committee, criticized Hillary Clinton for not maintaining a smile during a televised forum. His comments have reignited debate about the often belittling societal norms that suggest women should be perpetually cheerful.

Chelsea Handler, the celebrated comedian, responded to Priebus's remarks during an episode of her Netflix show. With her characteristic wit, Handler questioned Priebus's authority to dictate how women should express themselves, suggesting that such demands are not only misplaced but also counterproductive. She articulated a widely shared sentiment that telling women to smile serves merely to undermine their agency and contributions.

Handler’s commentary underlines a critical point: the societal double standards regarding smiling. While men often face no such pressure, women are frequently urged to maintain a pleasant demeanor, irrespective of the context. This expectation can detract from their professional presence and emotional authenticity.

Moreover, Handler emphasized that the decision to smile should be contingent on positive circumstances. She specifically noted that women, including Clinton, will naturally express joy when meaningful achievements take place. In this light, smiles become not mere obligations but genuine expressions shaped by accomplishments and satisfaction.

As discussions like these gain momentum, it is clear that the conversation around how women are perceived—and the pressures they face to conform to traditional norms—continues to evolve. Encouraging women to smile only when appropriate may foster a more supportive and respectful dialogue moving forward.",15.0,38.0,299.0,1.0714285714285714,0.05016722408026756,306.0,2.7142857142857144,0.12418300653594772
Real_91-Webpage,Is Donald Trump qualified to be president?,"Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.

H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.”

Likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.

Story Continued Below

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.

But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump’s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?

1. Does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country?

Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump — who swooned after Clinton’s superb convention in Philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.

His resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.

The first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream.

This is not to suggest that Trump can’t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.

Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates — but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care.

The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. “When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.”

Stone argued that Trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.

Trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.

Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD’s Section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?

2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?

Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: “We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.”

That’s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: “For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “Article 12 of the Constitution.” The framers stopped at seven. “He was just listing out numbers,” said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. “I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.”

OK, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “Free Exercise” clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.

3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?

Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.

But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.

Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much).

More serious is the issue of Trump’s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns.

This isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.

4. What’s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there’s the matter of Trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In exposé after exposé, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.

The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.

5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.

But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.

Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary” in Trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.

But it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially George W. Bush’s claims about Iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read POLITICO’s comprehensive “Donald Trump’s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths” for a taste.)

In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “Clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…”

But getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. It’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.

As the nation gears up for the first presidential debate, all eyes are on Donald Trump, who faces what many describe as his critical job interview for the presidency. This highly anticipated event provides a platform not only for Trump to solidify his standing as a candidate but also for rival Hillary Clinton to reclaim the narrative and address the skepticism surrounding her own candidacy. 

The debate comes at a crucial time, as both candidates are under intense scrutiny, grappling with personal controversies that threaten their electoral viability. For Trump, the challenge lies primarily in establishing his credibility and qualifications. He has been characterized as an opaque candidate, often leaning on broad ideas and a strong persona instead of presenting a clear blueprint for governance. This debate represents a significant opportunity for him to showcase a deeper understanding of both domestic and foreign affairs and demonstrate his knowledge of the Constitution.

In addition to proving his qualifications, Trump must confront several key issues that have been brought to light during the campaign. Polls indicate that while he remains popular among the white working-class demographic, he continues to struggle with overall favorability ratings. This is compounded by growing concerns about his grasp of fundamental government principles and engagement with the press, both of which are vital in restoring the trust and confidence of the electorate.

Trump's self-confidence and impatience, frequently noted by advisors and allies, have played a significant role in shaping his learning and decision-making style. However, this approach raises alarms about his ability to navigate complex political landscapes. Critics question whether his focus on broad rhetoric is a façade for an inadequate understanding of the intricacies involved in leading a nation.

Moreover, his refusal to release tax returns has amplified doubts regarding his financial claims and debts, particularly those extending to foreign creditors. Speculation continues to swirl around the implications of his financial dealings, leaving voters wondering about the transparency of a candidate seeking the highest office. Adding to the controversies surrounding Trump is the issue relating to his charitable foundation. Concerns about mismanagement and the accountability of donations have surfaced, leading many to question the integrity of his philanthropic commitments.

A crucial aspect of the upcoming debate will revolve around the pattern of dishonesty that has emerged in Trump's public life. Critics have framed this pattern as disqualifying behavior for anyone aspiring to the presidency. Trump's truthfulness, or lack thereof, remains a pivotal aspect of his public perception, influencing voter opinions as much as any policy position he might espouse.

On the other side of the podium stands Hillary Clinton, who also must prove her credibility and address the concerns of a skeptical electorate. In recent years, she has faced a barrage of scrutiny related to her email practices and her family's charitable foundation. These issues have cast shadows on her reputation, and many voters are eager for her to clarify her positions and intentions clearly.

As the debate approaches, it is clear that both candidates must confront their weaknesses head-on. Clinton's task will be to counter the skepticism regarding her email and foundation controversies while reinforcing her experience and capability to lead. Her journey in the public eye has seen both significant achievements and notable missteps, and this debate may provide the opportunity to reestablish her narrative as a seasoned leader and a trustworthy candidate.

In conclusion, the first presidential debate holds significant weight for both Trump and Clinton. With voters eager for clarity on issues surrounding qualifications, credibility, and character, the dialogue that unfolds in this forum will likely shape perceptions and influence the race moving forward. As the nation watches, deciding who, if either, among these candidates emerges as a viable leader will hinge not only on their ability to articulate their visions for America but also on their willingness to confront their respective controversies. The stakes are high, and the implications of this debate will resonate far beyond the political arena, impacting the landscape of American democracy itself.",18.0,22.0,2547.0,0.21686746987951808,0.007067137809187279,747.0,0.7586206896551724,0.029451137884872823
