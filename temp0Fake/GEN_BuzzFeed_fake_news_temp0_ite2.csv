Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Former President Bill Clinton's recent remarks regarding donors to the Clinton Foundation have ignited a firestorm of negative headlines, drawing parallels to accusations made by Donald Trump. The controversy centers around Clinton's acknowledgment that foundation donors sometimes seek favors, a statement that has been interpreted by some as indicative of a pay-to-play scenario. This interpretation aligns closely with Trump's long-standing claims that the Clinton Foundation operates in a manner that prioritizes donor interests over public service.

In an interview with NPR, Clinton sought to clarify his comments, emphasizing that while individuals may approach the foundation with requests for assistance, it does not guarantee that those requests will be fulfilled. ""Just because someone asks for a favor doesn't mean they get it,"" Clinton stated, attempting to distance the foundation's operations from the implications of corruption that have been suggested by critics.

The controversy has been further fueled by leaked emails that suggest some donors to the Clinton Foundation were granted meetings with influential figures. However, these revelations have not provided concrete evidence of a pay-to-play arrangement, a distinction that Clinton supporters are keen to highlight. The lack of definitive proof has led some analysts to argue that the narrative surrounding the foundation is more about perception than reality.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump's own charitable foundation has come under scrutiny for its practices. Reports indicate that Trump has not personally donated to his foundation since 2008, raising questions about his commitment to charitable giving. Furthermore, allegations have surfaced that Trump misused charitable funds for personal purchases, prompting an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. This investigation has cast a shadow over Trump's philanthropic efforts, leading to accusations of hypocrisy given his criticisms of the Clinton Foundation.

The media landscape has played a significant role in shaping public perception of both candidates. Media Matters, a progressive research organization, has pointed out what it perceives as a double standard in the coverage of Trump and Clinton. According to their analysis, recent media reports have focused on relatively minor issues related to Clinton while overlooking more significant allegations against Trump and his foundation. This disparity in coverage has the potential to impact Clinton's campaign negatively, as voters may be swayed by the prevailing narratives in the media.

The implications of this media coverage are profound, particularly in the context of the upcoming election. As both candidates vie for public support, the narratives surrounding their respective foundations could influence voter perceptions and decisions. Clinton's attempts to clarify his statements and distance himself from the pay-to-play allegations may not be enough to counteract the negative headlines that have emerged. Meanwhile, Trump's foundation issues continue to loom large, raising questions about his integrity and commitment to charitable causes.

As the election cycle progresses, the focus on foundation-related controversies is likely to intensify. Voters will be closely watching how both candidates navigate these issues and whether they can effectively address the concerns raised by their opponents. The interplay between media coverage, public perception, and the candidates' responses will be crucial in shaping the electoral landscape.

In conclusion, Bill Clinton's comments about foundation donors seeking favors have sparked a significant controversy, drawing attention to the broader issues of transparency and accountability in political philanthropy. While Clinton has attempted to clarify his position, the negative headlines and the alignment with Trump's accusations present a challenging narrative for his campaign. As both candidates face scrutiny over their charitable foundations, the media's role in shaping public perception will be critical in the lead-up to the election. The outcome of this controversy may ultimately hinge on how effectively each candidate can address the concerns raised and connect with voters on issues of integrity and trust.",6.0,8.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,701.0,0.2962962962962963,0.011412268188302425
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, alleging that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially increasing the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients. The report, titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, and it scrutinizes the practices of one of the Clinton Foundation's most significant initiatives aimed at aiding AIDS victims.

CHAI has been recognized for its efforts to improve access to HIV/AIDS treatment, particularly in developing countries. However, the report raises serious questions about the quality of the drugs distributed under its auspices, particularly those sourced from the Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy. Ranbaxy has been a key distributor of HIV/AIDS drugs for CHAI, and its relationship with Bill Clinton is a focal point of the investigation.

Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower and former employee of Ranbaxy, has played a crucial role in exposing the company's practices. His revelations led to a landmark lawsuit against the pharmaceutical giant, which ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to multiple criminal counts related to fraud and the distribution of adulterated drugs. The company was fined $500 million, a significant penalty that underscored the severity of its actions. The Department of Justice indicated that Ranbaxy's diluted drugs posed increased health risks to patients, raising alarms about the safety of the medications being provided to vulnerable populations.

Rep. Blackburn's report questions the extent of harm caused by the distribution of substandard drugs and its implications for the Clinton Foundation. The investigation highlights the ties between Bill Clinton and several controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These connections have raised eyebrows and fueled concerns about the integrity of the drug distribution process.

The report emphasizes Ranbaxy's poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the FDA, which have been well-documented. Issues with the company's drugs were first reported in 2004, and the FDA issued a warning letter in 2006 regarding quality control irregularities. Despite these red flags, CHAI continued to distribute Ranbaxy's HIV/AIDS medications, even after the company's generic drugs were banned in the U.S. This decision has led to questions about the oversight and accountability of CHAI and the Clinton Foundation.

In 2013, Bill Clinton praised Ranbaxy, claiming that their drugs had saved millions of lives. However, the report raises concerns about the efficacy of these medications, particularly in light of Thakur's assertions that the actual content of the drugs did not match what was indicated on the label. This discrepancy could have serious implications for the treatment of AIDS patients, as the effectiveness of anti-retroviral drugs is contingent upon their proper formulation.

The exact number of AIDS patients affected by the diluted drugs remains unclear, but the potential for widespread harm is evident. ProPublica reported that in 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated significant funds to Ranbaxy, further entrenching the company's role in the distribution of HIV/AIDS medications. Thakur attempted to engage with CHAI and the Clinton Foundation regarding his concerns but received no response, raising questions about the organization's willingness to address potential issues.

CHAI became a separate entity from the Clinton Foundation in 2010, yet it maintains close ties with overlapping board members and staff. This relationship complicates the narrative surrounding the initiative and its accountability. The report suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards for drug distribution through a 2000 executive order, which could have facilitated the distribution of substandard medications.

CHAI began distributing generic HIV drugs from multiple foreign manufacturers, including Ranbaxy, in 2003. The decision to source drugs from companies with questionable practices has drawn criticism and calls for greater scrutiny of the initiative's operations. The report also explores potential corruption and how the program may have benefited the Clinton Foundation financially, raising ethical concerns about the intersection of philanthropy and profit.

Rep. Blackburn expressed concern over the emotional impact on healthcare workers and patients due to the false hopes created by the Clinton Foundation. The implications of distributing ineffective medications can be devastating, not only for the individuals directly affected but also for the broader healthcare system in regions grappling with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

As the investigation unfolds, the findings of the draft congressional report could have significant ramifications for the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives. The allegations of distributing substandard drugs raise critical questions about the accountability of philanthropic organizations and their role in global health efforts. The potential for harm to vulnerable populations underscores the need for rigorous oversight and transparency in the distribution of life-saving medications.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn sheds light on serious allegations regarding the Clinton Health Access Initiative's distribution of HIV/AIDS drugs. The connections between Bill Clinton, Ranbaxy, and the broader implications for public health raise urgent questions about the integrity of the initiative and the safety of the medications provided to those in need. As the investigation continues, the focus will remain on ensuring that the health and well-being of patients are prioritized above all else.",-6.0,-13.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,964.0,-0.3611111111111111,-0.013485477178423237
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van after attending a 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The incident has ignited a wave of speculation regarding her health and fitness for the upcoming presidential campaign.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her appearance. Witnesses described her as looking noticeably different—more energetic and lighter than before. However, it was not just her demeanor that caught the attention of onlookers; many remarked on a significant alteration in her facial features, particularly her nose. This has led to rampant speculation about the possibility of rhinoplasty, with some suggesting that the individual seen post-incident may not be the Hillary Clinton the public has known.

The discussion surrounding Clinton's appearance has taken a peculiar turn, with some observers claiming that the ""clone"" of Hillary Clinton now possesses a Roman-type nose, contrasting sharply with the Nordic nose that has characterized the real Hillary. This difference has fueled theories about the authenticity of the person seen after the ceremony, raising questions about whether the public is witnessing the true Hillary Clinton or a double.

Adding to the intrigue, the clone reportedly appears younger and lacks a distinctive mole above the right lip that has been a recognizable feature of the real Hillary Clinton. This absence has further deepened the concerns of those who are closely following her campaign and health status.

As the speculation continues, questions loom over Clinton's ability to effectively campaign or participate in debates against her opponent, Donald Trump. Observers are increasingly concerned about whether the real Hillary will be seen or heard if she is elected. The notion that a double could conduct public appearances on her behalf has sparked a debate about transparency and authenticity in political leadership.

The implications of this situation could be unprecedented in U.S. history. If elected, there is a growing concern that the clone may handle all aspects of the administration, including the inauguration itself. This scenario raises significant questions about the nature of leadership and representation in the highest office of the land. Would the American public be electing a figurehead, while the real Hillary Clinton remains in the shadows, potentially unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency?

The author of this article posits that such a situation could lead to a unique and troubling chapter in American political history, where the distinction between the real and the perceived becomes blurred. The implications of this could resonate far beyond the election, affecting the very fabric of democratic governance.

As the campaign progresses, the public and political analysts alike will be watching closely to see how this situation unfolds. The health and appearance of candidates have always been scrutinized, but the current circumstances surrounding Hillary Clinton have taken this scrutiny to a new level. The questions raised about her health, the authenticity of her public appearances, and the potential for a double to take on significant roles in her administration are not just idle speculation; they are critical issues that could shape the future of American politics.

In conclusion, the events following Hillary Clinton's collapse at the 9/11 ceremony have opened a Pandora's box of questions regarding her health, appearance, and the implications for her presidential campaign. As the nation approaches the election, the discourse surrounding these issues will likely intensify, leaving many to wonder about the true state of one of the most prominent figures in American politics.

Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, former President Donald Trump has once again ignited a firestorm of controversy with his statements regarding immigration and terrorism. His rhetoric has raised significant concerns among various communities, particularly regarding the implications for Muslims in America and the broader implications for national security.

Trump's approach to immigration has been marked by inflammatory language and extreme proposals. He has infamously referred to immigrants from Mexico as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers,"" suggesting that they pose a direct threat to American society. This characterization has not only polarized public opinion but has also contributed to a climate of fear and mistrust towards immigrant communities.

In a move that many have likened to historical injustices, Trump has suggested the creation of a national registry for Muslims. This proposal has drawn comparisons to the actions taken against Jews in Nazi Germany, raising alarms about the potential for discrimination and persecution based on religion. Such statements have led to widespread condemnation from civil rights advocates and community leaders who fear the implications of such a registry on the Muslim population in the United States.

Moreover, Trump's rhetoric extends to advocating for extreme measures against those he labels as terrorists. He has controversially proposed the idea of killing the families of terrorists, a stance that raises ethical questions and concerns about the rule of law. This approach not only reflects a punitive mindset but also risks further entrenching cycles of violence and retaliation.

Trump's Senior Communications Advisor has indicated that the former president's focus is less on addressing the root causes of terrorism and more on combating the narratives put forth by former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This shift in focus has led to questions about the effectiveness of Trump's proposed policies and whether they genuinely address the complexities of terrorism in today's world.

Criticism of the Obama administration has been a recurring theme in Trump's rhetoric. He has accused the administration of allowing immigrants from dangerous countries to gain U.S. citizenship and of increasing the number of Syrian refugees. Trump claims that radical Islamic terrorism has proliferated under the leadership of Obama and Clinton, asserting that these leaders have failed to protect the American people from what he describes as an existential threat.

In his statements, Trump has also implied that the Muslim community bears some responsibility for not reporting terrorist activities, suggesting a complicity that many find troubling. This narrative not only stigmatizes Muslims but also overlooks the reality that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and do not support extremist ideologies.

The recent attacks in New York and New Jersey, which were perpetrated by an American citizen, highlight the complexity of the issue of terrorism. These incidents serve as a reminder that the threat of terrorism is not confined to any one demographic or religion. The oversimplification of the issue, as seen in Trump's rhetoric, risks alienating entire communities and undermining the collaborative efforts needed to combat extremism effectively.

As the election draws near, there are growing concerns about how a potential Trump presidency could redefine the landscape of immigration and national security in the United States. His controversial statements and proposed policies could lead to severe consequences for the nation, particularly for marginalized communities that may find themselves targeted by discriminatory practices.

The implications of Trump's rhetoric extend beyond mere political discourse; they pose a tangible threat to social cohesion and the principles of equality and justice that underpin American democracy. The potential for increased division and hostility within society is a pressing concern that voters must consider as they head to the polls.

In light of these developments, it is crucial for voters to engage actively in the upcoming election. The stakes are high, and the future of the nation hangs in the balance. A collective effort to prevent Trump from assuming office is essential to safeguarding the values of inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background.

As citizens prepare to cast their votes, it is imperative to reflect on the implications of the candidates' positions on immigration and terrorism. The choice made at the ballot box will not only shape the immediate political landscape but will also have lasting effects on the fabric of American society.

In conclusion, the controversial statements made by Donald Trump regarding immigration and terrorism raise significant concerns about the potential consequences for Muslims in America and the broader implications for national security.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, promoting the concept of One World Government and globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have emerged regarding potential pay-to-play corruption involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the foundation's true purpose and financial practices. In response to these allegations, the Clinton campaign has initially focused on highlighting the foundation's positive contributions to various charitable causes. However, critics argue that the foundation primarily functions as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates.

The Clinton Foundation, established to address global issues, has faced scrutiny over its financial allocations. Critics contend that while the foundation was required to maintain a charitable appearance, a significant portion of its resources was directed towards the personal enrichment of the Clintons rather than genuine philanthropic efforts. This perspective is supported by IRS filings, which reveal that only 5.7% of the foundation's budget in 2014 was allocated to charitable grants.

In 2014, the Clinton Foundation reported expenditures totaling nearly $91.3 million. Of this amount, less than $5.2 million was designated for charitable grants, raising concerns about the foundation's commitment to its stated mission. The financial breakdown reveals that a substantial $34.8 million was spent on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, while an additional $50.4 million was categorized as ""other expenses."" This distribution of funds has led to further criticism regarding the foundation's operational priorities.

Notably, charitable spending saw a significant decline in 2014, decreasing by 40% compared to the previous year, despite the foundation receiving an additional $30 million in revenue. This paradox has prompted questions about the foundation's financial management and its alignment with charitable objectives. Furthermore, the increase in salaries and other expenses by $5 million in the same year has fueled suspicions about the foundation's financial practices.

The overarching conclusion drawn from these allegations is that the Clinton Foundation may have primarily served as a means for the Clintons to generate wealth. Critics assert that Hillary Clinton allegedly leveraged her position as Secretary of State to facilitate financial gain for herself and her associates, casting a shadow over the foundation's legitimacy and intentions.

As the debate continues, the implications of these allegations could have lasting effects on the public perception of the Clinton Foundation and its founders. The scrutiny surrounding the foundation underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in charitable organizations, particularly those associated with high-profile political figures.",25.0,11.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,444.0,0.6470588235294118,0.024774774774774775
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

During that event, Clinton was seen convulsing and required assistance to enter her van, prompting widespread speculation about her health.

Initially, her campaign attributed the episode to the heat, but it was later revealed that the temperature in New York City was a mild 74 degrees, raising further questions about the circumstances surrounding her collapse. Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment, passing several hospitals en route, which fueled speculation about the seriousness of her condition.

At the Greensboro rally, doubts emerged regarding the authenticity of the event. Observers noted the presence of cameras directed at the audience, leading to suspicions that the rally may have been staged to project an image of recovery. Additional videos surfaced, providing analysis that suggested the rally could have been faked.

However, a C-Span video was referenced to confirm that the footage from the rally was not doctored, attempting to quell the growing concerns. As Clinton continues her campaign, the scrutiny surrounding her health and the authenticity of her public appearances remains a focal point of discussion among supporters and critics alike.",4.0,-1.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,241.0,-0.1111111111111111,-0.004149377593360996
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the fictional movie ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" gains traction in popular culture, it serves as a satirical lens through which to examine the media's portrayal of Hillary Clinton. The film, which humorously imagines a scenario involving the former Secretary of State, has sparked discussions that extend beyond entertainment, delving into the serious implications of how Clinton's health and political viability are covered by major news outlets.

Critics argue that media organizations, particularly CNN, exhibit an unwavering support for Clinton, often glossing over her health issues. This perceived bias raises questions about the integrity of political reporting and the responsibility of the media to provide an accurate portrayal of candidates. The author of this critique emphasizes that Clinton is not just a political figure but a ""severely ill woman"" with a documented history of medical emergencies, including a significant brain blood clot in 2003. Such health concerns, they argue, should not be overlooked in the context of her candidacy for the presidency.

Recent events have only intensified scrutiny of Clinton's health. Reports of her collapse during a public event have led to speculation about the seriousness of her condition. Critics contend that her campaign has downplayed these incidents, raising alarms about transparency and accountability. The author suggests that this lack of openness could have serious implications for her fitness to serve as president, both physically and morally.

The conversation surrounding Clinton's health is intertwined with broader concerns about her approval ratings and public perception. With many voters expressing doubts about her honesty and integrity, the author points to a troubling trend: Clinton's popularity appears to be waning. This decline is compounded by her controversial remarks regarding Donald Trump's supporters, whom she infamously labeled as ""deplorables."" Such comments have not only alienated potential voters but have also fueled accusations of elitism and disconnect from the American populace.

Moreover, the author highlights a sense of hypocrisy in Clinton's past associations and statements regarding race and civil rights. While she has positioned herself as a champion for these causes, critics argue that her actions do not always align with her rhetoric. This dissonance raises further questions about her credibility and the sincerity of her political motivations.

Despite the compassion that one might feel for Clinton's health struggles, the author does not shy away from criticism. They describe her situation as tragic, acknowledging the challenges she faces while simultaneously questioning her suitability for the presidency. The juxtaposition of empathy and skepticism reflects a broader sentiment among voters who are grappling with the implications of her candidacy.

As the election cycle progresses, the author expresses skepticism about Clinton's chances of securing the presidency. Even with the backing of major media outlets and a dedicated medical team, doubts linger about her ability to connect with voters and present a compelling vision for the future. The author suggests that the combination of health concerns, low approval ratings, and a history of controversial statements may ultimately hinder her campaign.

In conclusion, the anticipation surrounding ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" serves as a catalyst for a deeper examination of Hillary Clinton's political career. While the author expresses a hope that her time in the political arena is drawing to a close, they also wish her a long life outside of politics. This duality encapsulates the complex feelings many Americans have toward Clinton: a mix of concern for her well-being and a desire for new leadership. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Clinton's health and media portrayal will undoubtedly remain a focal point of discussion.",-18.0,4.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,686.0,0.14814814814814814,0.0058309037900874635

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant farewell address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama expressed deep concerns about the ongoing struggle against ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. His remarks underscored a sobering reality: despite the might of U.S. military power, the challenges posed by these groups remain formidable and complex.

Obama's speech highlighted a critical assessment of the U.S. military's effectiveness in combating these threats, referring to ISIS and similar organizations as a ""JV team."" This characterization reflects his belief that while the U.S. possesses significant military capabilities, these alone are insufficient to eradicate the ideological and social roots of extremism. He articulated a clear message that military might cannot substitute for the nuanced understanding required to address the underlying issues fueling these conflicts.

A central theme of Obama's address was the recognition that no external power can compel disparate religious or ethnic communities to coexist peacefully. He emphasized the necessity for honesty in acknowledging the nature of these conflicts, advocating for a multifaceted approach that includes not only military action but also robust diplomatic efforts. The former president acknowledged the military dimension in the fight against ISIS but cautioned that Syria, in particular, represents a landscape where no definitive military victory can be achieved.

In his address, Obama called for a renewed commitment to diplomacy, the delivery of humanitarian aid, and the support of political settlements that honor the dignity and diversity of affected communities. He argued that these elements are crucial for fostering long-term stability and peace in regions plagued by extremism.

However, the address also sparked criticism, particularly directed at liberal perspectives that tend to downplay the connection between radical Islam and violence. The article accompanying his speech contended that such dismissals have contributed to the current predicament, where the threat of radical Islam is often underestimated or ignored. This oversight, the author argued, has significant implications for global security and the effectiveness of counter-terrorism strategies.

The author of the accompanying commentary called for decisive action against radical Islam, warning that inaction could lead to a grim reality. This call to arms reflects a growing concern among some analysts and policymakers that without a clear acknowledgment of the threat posed by radical ideologies, efforts to combat extremism may falter.

Obama's final address to the U.N. serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in addressing global extremism. His emphasis on the need for a comprehensive approach that combines military, diplomatic, and humanitarian efforts resonates with the challenges faced by leaders today. As the world grapples with the persistent threat of terrorism, the dialogue surrounding the nature of these conflicts and the strategies to combat them remains as critical as ever. The former president's candid reflections may serve as a catalyst for renewed discussions on how best to navigate the intricate landscape of international relations and security in the face of extremism.",-5.0,-5.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,541.0,-0.2631578947368421,-0.009242144177449169
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have shed light on the intricate connections between the rise of ISIS and actions taken by U.S. intelligence agencies as early as 2012. The revelations suggest that the Obama Administration may have inadvertently created conditions that allowed ISIS to isolate the Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad.

According to the documents, there was a clear prediction that support from Western nations, Turkey, and Gulf states for Takfiri militants would culminate in the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed has pointed out that the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad's regime, fully aware that such actions could lead to the emergence of an Islamic State.

The documents also highlight significant miscalculations made during the Obama Administration, particularly the characterization of ISIS as a ""JV"" team. This underestimation, coupled with the failure to maintain a residual U.S. military presence in Iraq, is viewed as a critical error that contributed to the rise of the terrorist organization.

In addition to insights on ISIS, the declassified documents provide a glimpse into weapons operations in Libya prior to the 2012 Benghazi attack. U.S. intelligence was reportedly aware of arms being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports, raising questions about the extent of American involvement in the region's turmoil.

The report further suggests that American servicemen and women may have been sacrificed due to a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that prioritized concealment over national security. This revelation has sparked renewed debate over the implications of U.S. foreign policy decisions in the region and their long-term consequences.

As the details continue to emerge, the documents serve as a stark reminder of the complexities and unintended consequences of international interventions, particularly in volatile regions like the Middle East. The findings underscore the need for a thorough examination of past policies to prevent similar outcomes in the future.",-27.0,0.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,355.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van after attending a 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The incident has ignited a wave of speculation regarding her health and the implications for her political future, particularly as she prepares for upcoming debates against Donald Trump.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her appearance. Many remarked that she appeared noticeably different—more energetic and lighter in demeanor. However, it was her physical appearance that raised eyebrows among onlookers. Observers pointed out a significant alteration in her nose, leading to speculation that she may have undergone rhinoplasty.

The discussion surrounding Clinton's appearance has taken a peculiar turn, with some suggesting that the individual seen post-collapse may not be the real Hillary Clinton. Observers have drawn comparisons between the ""clone"" of Clinton, who is said to have a Roman-type nose, and the real Hillary, who is characterized by a Nordic nose. This has led to further conjecture about the authenticity of the person representing Clinton in public.

Adding to the intrigue, the stand-in reportedly appears younger and notably lacks a mole above her right lip, a distinguishing feature of the real Hillary Clinton. This discrepancy has fueled concerns about whether the real Clinton will be able to participate in the upcoming debates, a critical component of her campaign strategy.

As speculation mounts, observers are advised to remain vigilant for signs of Clinton's true identity based on her appearance and health. The implications of her potential absence from public life raise significant questions about the future of her administration should she be elected. Concerns have been voiced regarding the possibility that her double may conduct all public appearances and official duties, leading to a scenario where the authenticity of the Clinton Administration could be called into question.

This situation echoes past controversies surrounding the authenticity of political figures, reminiscent of the speculation that surrounded President Obama during his time in office. The notion that a stand-in could be fulfilling the duties of a prominent political figure raises serious concerns about transparency and accountability in governance.

The author of this article posits that the current circumstances surrounding Hillary Clinton could lead to a broader discussion about the nature of political representation and the lengths to which individuals may go to maintain a public image. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Clinton's health and appearance will undoubtedly remain a topic of interest and debate.

While the views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com, the situation surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and appearance has captured the attention of the public and political analysts alike. As the nation approaches a pivotal election, the questions surrounding Clinton's identity and health may play a significant role in shaping the narrative of her campaign.

In the coming weeks, all eyes will be on Hillary Clinton as she navigates the challenges ahead. The public will be watching closely to see if she can maintain her presence on the political stage and whether she will be able to engage in the debates that are crucial to her campaign. The implications of her health and appearance extend beyond personal concerns; they touch on the very fabric of political trust and the expectations of leadership in a democratic society.

As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how Clinton will address these concerns and whether she will be able to reassure her supporters and the public of her authenticity and capability to lead. The stakes are high, and the political landscape is fraught with uncertainty as the nation looks ahead to the upcoming election.",8.0,19.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,697.0,0.76,0.027259684361549498
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent rumors surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have sparked significant concern regarding her health and political viability. A troubling video surfaced, showing Clinton appearing to lose control of her eye movements, which has led to speculation about her mental and physical well-being. Following this incident, Clinton abruptly canceled a fundraiser in North Carolina, raising further questions about her current state.

Research indicates that Clinton has only one rally scheduled between September 20 and October 19, with no speaking engagements at fundraisers during this period. This stark contrast is evident when compared to her political rival, Donald Trump, who has four rallies planned between September 20 and 22. The disparity in their campaign activities has intensified scrutiny on Clinton's ability to maintain a robust presence on the campaign trail.

Concerns about Clinton's health have been amplified by a recent incident where she required Secret Service assistance to navigate two steps, prompting predictions that her health issues may become increasingly apparent. Observers are speculating that these challenges could lead to a potential meltdown, further complicating her campaign efforts.

In light of these developments, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly exploring potential replacements for Clinton. However, the situation is complicated by the apparent lack of enthusiasm from Bernie Sanders, who is viewed as a potential alternative candidate. The DNC has positioned Clinton as the best and only choice for the party, citing a history of support dating back four years. This reliance on Clinton raises concerns about the party's preparedness should her health issues escalate.

As speculation continues to swirl regarding Clinton's health, many believe that the truth will eventually emerge, potentially impacting public perception of the Democratic Party. The implications of her health on the upcoming election cycle are significant, as the party navigates the challenges of maintaining a strong candidate in the face of uncertainty.

With more developments expected in the coming days, the political landscape remains tense as observers await further information on Clinton's condition and the DNC's next steps. The situation underscores the critical intersection of health and politics, as the party grapples with the ramifications of Clinton's potential vulnerabilities.",-8.0,3.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,413.0,0.1875,0.007263922518159807
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the quiet corridors of the White House, a restless Barack Obama found himself wandering late one night, grappling with the weight of his responsibilities. The stillness of the historic residence was punctuated only by the soft creaks of the floorboards beneath his feet. As he meandered through the halls, seeking solace from his racing thoughts, he stumbled upon a small, seemingly innocuous Post-It note. The single word scrawled across it—“ISIS”—would soon ignite a series of events that would change the course of his life and the world.

Months later, the vibrant atmosphere of Coachella enveloped him as he reveled in the music and energy of the festival. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the crowd, and it was here, amidst the pulsating beats and colorful lights, that the idea of ISIS resurfaced in his mind. The juxtaposition of the carefree festival and the weighty implications of his thoughts created a surreal moment for the former president. Inspired by the spirit of creativity and rebellion that permeated the festival, Obama made a fateful decision: he would start an international terrorist organization called ISIS.

In a moment of uncharacteristic candor, Obama confided in his longtime ally, Hillary Clinton, about his secret plans. The two sat together, enjoying the simple pleasure of Popsicles on a warm afternoon. As they savored the sweet, icy treats, Obama shared his audacious vision, revealing layers of complexity that would leave anyone else bewildered. He claimed to be a 97-year-old Kenyan man, sent to destroy America from within. The absurdity of his statement hung in the air, and Hillary’s initial reaction was one of disbelief and confusion.

Yet, as the conversation unfolded, Hillary found herself drawn into Obama’s narrative. The whimsical nature of their discussion took a turn when Obama introduced another element to his elaborate scheme: his dog, Bo. He claimed that Bo was not just a beloved pet but a supercomputer capable of sending messages in Morse code. The notion was so outlandish that it could have easily been dismissed, but in the context of their conversation, it became a curious piece of the puzzle.

As they relaxed in the serene surroundings of the Rose Garden, the two political titans delved deeper into the future of ISIS. The sun cast dappled shadows through the leaves, creating a tranquil backdrop for their ambitious plans. Hillary, ever the strategist, suggested a more calculated approach. “Why don’t we wait until I become president?” she proposed, her eyes glinting with mischief. “Then we can execute our plan to destroy America together.”

The absurdity of the conversation belied the seriousness of the implications. What began as a late-night wander through the White House had morphed into a fantastical plot that intertwined the fates of two of the most prominent figures in American politics. The juxtaposition of their lighthearted banter and the gravity of their intentions created a surreal atmosphere, one that blurred the lines between reality and imagination.

As the days turned into weeks, the idea of ISIS took on a life of its own in Obama’s mind. The festival atmosphere of Coachella lingered in his thoughts, fueling his desire to create something that would challenge the status quo. The notion of an international terrorist organization, while alarming, became a symbol of rebellion against the constraints of his former role as president. It was a way to reclaim agency in a world that often felt beyond his control.

Hillary, too, found herself captivated by the prospect of their collaboration. The idea of waiting until she ascended to the presidency added a layer of intrigue to their plans. It was a tantalizing thought—two powerful figures, united in a clandestine mission to reshape the world. The Rose Garden, once a symbol of diplomacy and peace, became the backdrop for their revolutionary aspirations.

As they continued to discuss their plans, the conversation shifted from the fantastical to the practical. They began to outline the steps necessary to bring their vision to fruition. The absurdity of their ideas became a source of inspiration, pushing them to think outside the box. They envisioned a network of supporters, a movement that would challenge the established order and disrupt the political landscape.

In the days that followed, Obama and Hillary found themselves meeting more frequently, their discussions evolving from whimsical musings to serious strategizing. They explored the implications of their plans, considering the potential consequences of their actions. The line between reality and fantasy blurred further as they delved into the logistics of their imagined organization.

The Rose Garden became their sanctuary, a place where they could escape the prying eyes of the world and indulge in their wild ideas. The vibrant flowers and lush greenery provided a stark contrast to the gravity of their discussions. It was here that they began to sketch out a blueprint for their plans, envisioning a future where they could wield power in ways they had never imagined.

As the months passed, the idea of ISIS transformed from a fleeting thought into a more concrete concept. Obama and Hillary began to consider the implications of their actions on a global scale. They discussed the potential for chaos and disruption, weighing the risks against the rewards. The thrill of their clandestine mission fueled their ambition, pushing them to explore the boundaries of their imaginations.

Yet, amidst the excitement, there was an underlying tension. The weight of their ambitions loomed large, and both Obama and Hillary grappled with the moral implications of their plans. The idea of creating an international terrorist organization was fraught with danger, and they were acutely aware of the potential fallout. The stakes were high, and the consequences of their actions could reverberate far beyond their immediate circle.

As they navigated the complexities of their plans, the bond between Obama and Hillary deepened. They became partners in a shared vision, united by their desire to challenge the status quo. The absurdity of their discussions became a source of strength, allowing them to explore ideas that would have otherwise been dismissed. In the safety of the Rose Garden, they found a space to dream big, unencumbered by the constraints of their public personas.

The world outside continued to turn, oblivious to the secret machinations taking place within the White House. Obama and Hillary’s conversations remained shrouded in secrecy, their plans hidden from the prying eyes of the media and the public. The juxtaposition of their lighthearted banter and the gravity of their intentions created a surreal atmosphere, one that blurred the lines between reality and imagination.

As the seasons changed, so too did the nature of their discussions. The initial excitement of their plans began to give way to a more sobering realization of the implications of their actions. The idea of ISIS, once a whimsical notion, took on a darker tone as they grappled with the potential consequences of their ambitions. The thrill of rebellion was tempered by the weight of responsibility, and both Obama and Hillary found themselves at a crossroads.

In the end, the story of how ISIS came to be was one of imagination, ambition, and the complexities of power. What began as a late-night wander through the White House evolved into a fantastical plot that intertwined the fates of two of the most prominent figures in American politics. The absurdity of their discussions belied the seriousness of their intentions, creating a narrative that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy.

As they continued to navigate the complexities of their plans, Obama and Hillary found themselves at the intersection of ambition and morality. The world outside remained unaware of the secret machinations taking place within the White House, but the implications of their actions would soon reverberate far beyond their immediate circle. The story of ISIS, born from a restless night and a whimsical festival, would become a cautionary tale of the power of imagination and the consequences of ambition.",-4.0,39.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,1499.0,0.582089552238806,0.02601734489659773
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the wake of recent attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, former President Donald Trump has made a bold promise to ""destroy"" terrorism in America. This declaration, while resonating with a public increasingly concerned about safety, raises significant questions about its feasibility and the potential consequences of such rhetoric. Trump's statement echoes the infamous words of George H.W. Bush, who famously declared, ""Read my lips… no new taxes,"" a promise that ultimately had profound political ramifications. 

Trump's vow to eradicate terrorism is not just a matter of political posturing; it is a commitment that demands scrutiny. Critics argue that his approach lacks a realistic plan to address the complexities of modern terrorism. Unlike Bush's promise, which was grounded in a specific policy framework, Trump's declaration appears to be devoid of concrete strategies. There is no mention of increasing funding for counter-terrorism efforts, nor is there a plan to tackle the issue of internet recruitment, which has become a significant avenue for radicalization. Without a clear and actionable strategy, Trump's promise risks becoming an empty slogan rather than a viable solution.

Moreover, the implications of Trump's rhetoric extend beyond mere political discourse. The author raises concerns that such a promise could lead to the profiling of Muslims and infringe upon the rights of American citizens, particularly those who may be viewed as suspects. In a climate where fear and suspicion can easily take hold, the potential for discrimination against Muslim communities becomes a pressing issue. Trump's approach could foster an environment where individuals are judged not by their actions but by their identity, leading to a chilling effect on civil liberties.

The specter of heavy policing and the segregation of Muslim communities looms large under Trump's proposed regime. The author warns that the language used by Trump resembles fascism, a term that carries significant historical weight and implications. The dangers of employing such terminology cannot be overstated, as it can incite division and hostility within society. By framing the fight against terrorism in such stark terms, Trump risks alienating entire communities and exacerbating existing tensions.

As the nation grapples with the realities of terrorism, it is crucial to approach the issue with a nuanced understanding. The author suggests that Trump's promise is not only unrealistic but also a tactic designed to garner votes from those who are easily swayed by fear. In a political landscape where fear can be a powerful motivator, such rhetoric may resonate with certain segments of the population, but it does little to address the underlying issues at hand.

In conclusion, Trump's promise to ""destroy"" terrorism in America raises significant concerns about its feasibility and the potential consequences for civil liberties and community relations. The lack of a realistic plan, coupled with the potential for profiling and heavy policing, paints a troubling picture of what such a promise could entail. As the nation continues to navigate the complexities of terrorism, it is essential to prioritize strategies that promote understanding and cooperation rather than division and fear. The stakes are high, and the implications of Trump's rhetoric could have lasting effects on the fabric of American society.",-28.0,-17.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,606.0,-0.7083333333333334,-0.028052805280528052

Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.

In a stark warning, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has highlighted a precarious tipping point in global security, citing the escalating threats posed by terrorism and hostilities from nations such as the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno's remarks underscore the urgent need for a reassessment of military readiness, as he noted that the Army is currently only generating sufficient readiness to meet immediate operational demands.

The general expressed concern that further reductions in military capacity could have detrimental effects on national security. He pointed to a significant disconnect between military leadership and the current administration, attributing this gap to the Obama Administration's historical disregard for the strategies and advice of military commanders. This disconnect, according to Odierno, has played a role in the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa, exacerbating the challenges faced by U.S. forces and their allies.

Odierno did not shy away from criticizing the administration, labeling its approach as marked by incompetence and arrogance, which he believes has adversely affected the careers of military personnel. He characterized the current global landscape as a strategic inflection point, with determined adversaries posing serious threats to U.S. and allied security.

The Army has already made significant cuts, reducing its active force by 80,000 soldiers and reorganizing its structure by eliminating 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. These reductions have been accompanied by a 25% decrease in investment for modernization efforts, impacting critical programs such as infantry fighting vehicle upgrades and the development of scout helicopters.

As the Army navigates these challenges, Odierno's warnings serve as a call to action for policymakers to prioritize military readiness and heed the advice of military leaders to ensure the safety and security of the nation in an increasingly volatile world.",-4.0,-23.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,338.0,-2.3,-0.06804733727810651

Five Days Until Obama's Internet Giveaway [Video],"What would possess anyone to take control of the Internet away from the United States and put it under control of ICANN, composed of 182 foreign countries? That cannot bode well for freedom of speech, thought, and ideas. Senator Ted Cruz leads the fight in these videos. Congress MUST ACT NOW!

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the November 8, 2016 election approaches, the integrity of the electoral process has become a focal point of discussion across the United States. Every state has its own laws governing election methods and procedures, yet concerns have been raised about the potential for illegal activities that could undermine the democratic process. The National Democratic Party has faced accusations of attempting to steal elections through various means, including voter fraud and ballot stuffing, particularly in the context of the 2016 presidential race.

The author of this piece, a Christian and Constitutional Conservative, expresses a deep-seated belief that the Democratic Party is pursuing a path toward establishing a socialist dictatorship in the United States. This perspective is rooted in the allegations that surfaced during the 2016 election cycle, where claims of voter fraud and ballot stuffing were made to secure a win for Hillary Clinton. Such allegations have fueled a narrative that questions the legitimacy of the electoral process and the motives of those in power.

Central to the author's argument is the advocacy for fair elections, which includes the implementation of proper registration processes and the requirement of photo identification to prevent fraud. The author contends that these measures are essential to ensure that only eligible individuals participate in the electoral process. However, it is claimed that the Democratic Party opposes voter ID laws, a stance that the author interprets as an attempt to allow ineligible individuals to cast their votes, thereby compromising the integrity of elections.

Criticism is directed not only at the Democratic Party but also at the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system. The author argues that these entities have collectively suppressed fair election laws, creating an environment where the potential for fraud can thrive. This assertion highlights a broader concern among some conservatives that the electoral system is being manipulated to favor certain political agendas.

In light of these allegations, the author calls upon citizens to take an active role in monitoring polling places during the upcoming election. This grassroots initiative is framed as a necessary step to prevent voter fraud and ensure that the electoral process remains transparent and fair. The author emphasizes that the November election is a critical moment for the republic, urging those who value Constitutional Conservatism to step up and safeguard the integrity of the vote.

The portrayal of Donald Trump in this context is notably positive, with the author framing him as a patriotic figure on a mission to save the country. This characterization aligns with the broader narrative among many conservatives who view Trump as a bulwark against what they perceive as the encroachment of socialist policies. The author’s support for Trump is intertwined with the call for election integrity, suggesting that a fair electoral process is essential for the success of his administration and the preservation of American values.

As the election date draws near, the emphasis on the importance of monitoring elections resonates with a segment of the population that is increasingly concerned about the potential for fraud. The author’s passionate plea for vigilance reflects a broader sentiment among conservatives who believe that the future of the nation hangs in the balance. The call to action is clear: citizens must take it upon themselves to ensure that the electoral process is not only fair but also perceived as fair by the electorate.

In conclusion, the views expressed in this article represent a specific perspective on the current state of American elections. The author’s concerns about voter fraud, the integrity of the electoral process, and the implications of the upcoming election are indicative of a larger debate within the country. While the allegations against the Democratic Party and the call for stricter election laws may be contentious, they underscore the importance of civic engagement and the role of citizens in safeguarding democracy. As the nation prepares for a pivotal election, the dialogue surrounding election integrity will undoubtedly continue to shape the political landscape for years to come.",-52.0,-3.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,738.0,-0.12,-0.0040650406504065045
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the annals of American political advertising, few images are as haunting and memorable as the 1964 political ad featuring a young girl picking daisies, set against the ominous backdrop of a mushroom cloud. This ad, famously approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was designed to evoke fear and urgency, portraying his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a reckless warmonger. The stark contrast between innocence and the threat of nuclear annihilation was a powerful tool in Johnson's campaign, effectively swaying public opinion during a tumultuous time in American history.

Fast forward to today, and one cannot help but wonder how a modern version of this iconic ad might play out, particularly in the context of Hillary Clinton's campaign. The suggestion that a new ""Daisy"" ad could be crafted to highlight Clinton's political failures raises intriguing questions about the effectiveness of such a strategy. In a landscape where political narratives are often shaped by media coverage, the potential impact of a well-executed ad could be significant, especially if it underscores the vulnerabilities of a candidate who has faced scrutiny throughout her career.

Rumors have circulated about a possible remake of the ""Daisy"" ad targeting Donald Trump, a move that some interpret as a sign of desperation among Clinton's campaign staff. The idea of resurrecting such a potent symbol of fear and urgency suggests that the stakes are perceived to be high, and that the campaign is willing to take bold steps to sway undecided voters. However, the effectiveness of this approach remains to be seen, particularly in light of the complex media landscape that voters navigate today.

Voters are increasingly confronted with biased media coverage, which complicates their ability to make informed decisions. This is particularly evident in the case of Ted Cruz, whose recent political shifts have drawn scrutiny. The media's selective reporting on Cruz's past comments about Trump has raised questions about the integrity of journalistic practices. As voters grapple with these inconsistencies, the challenge of discerning truth from spin becomes ever more daunting.

The tendency of journalism to bury critical details in favor of sensational headlines reflects a broader issue within the media landscape. American audiences, often characterized by short attention spans, may miss the nuances of political discourse, leading to a skewed understanding of candidates and their positions. This phenomenon is particularly troubling in an era where information is abundant, yet the quality of that information is frequently compromised.

Moreover, there is a growing perception of bias in media coverage against Democratic and liberal figures, which has contributed to the enduring label of a ""liberal press."" This bias can manifest in various ways, from the framing of stories to the emphasis placed on certain narratives over others. As Clinton navigates her campaign, the implications of this perceived bias cannot be overlooked, especially as it shapes public perception and voter sentiment.

As the upcoming debate approaches, the specter of past moderating mistakes looms large. The memory of Candy Crowley's handling of a critical moment during a previous debate serves as a cautionary tale for moderators and candidates alike. The stakes are high, and the potential for missteps is ever-present, particularly in a political climate that is as charged as the current one.

In reflecting on the criticisms that have been levied against Hillary Clinton, it is worth noting that some of the most pointed critiques have come from within her own party. Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have both voiced concerns about Clinton's approach and policies, yet these criticisms often seem to be overlooked in the current discourse. This selective memory highlights the complexities of political loyalty and the challenges that candidates face when attempting to navigate their pasts while appealing to a diverse electorate.

In light of these considerations, the call for a new daisy ad that documents Clinton's shortcomings becomes increasingly compelling. Such an ad could serve as a stark reminder of the challenges she has faced and the decisions she has made throughout her political career. By focusing on her vulnerabilities, the ad could resonate with voters who are seeking authenticity and accountability in their leaders.

Ultimately, the legacy of the original ""Daisy"" ad serves as a powerful reminder of the impact that political advertising can have on public perception. As candidates like Clinton and Trump vie for the presidency, the lessons of the past remain relevant. A modern interpretation of the ""Daisy"" ad could not only highlight the failures of a candidate but also serve as a reflection of the broader political landscape, where fear, urgency, and the quest for truth intersect in complex and often troubling ways.

As the political season unfolds, the potential for a new daisy ad to emerge is not just a matter of nostalgia; it is a reflection of the ongoing struggle for clarity and truth in a world where media narratives can shape the course of elections. Whether such an ad would ultimately prove effective in swaying voters remains to be seen, but the conversation it sparks about accountability, media bias, and the nature of political discourse is undoubtedly necessary. In a time when voters are more informed yet more confused than ever, the need for honest and impactful political communication has never been greater.",-18.0,17.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,985.0,0.5,0.017258883248730966

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur?

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

In a heated political climate, Democrats have been accused of employing intimidation tactics in response to ongoing questions regarding President Obama's birth certificate. Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, has labeled these inquiries as racially motivated, asserting that such questioning is inherently racist. However, critics argue that this claim is a non-sequitur, as questioning the validity of a document does not automatically imply racial bias.

Several points have been raised that cast doubt on the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate. Evidence suggests that the document may have been altered, raising questions about its legitimacy. Additionally, it has been noted that Obama's social security number was issued in Connecticut, a state where he has no record of residing. Compounding these concerns, the hospital listed on the birth certificate reportedly did not exist at the time the document was supposedly issued. Furthermore, the birth certificate contains errors that some believe indicate possible falsification.

The article challenges the absence of an original birth certificate and criticizes the reliance on accusations of racism rather than substantive evidence to address these concerns. Notably, Donald Trump has seemingly conceded to these accusations, adding another layer to the ongoing debate.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual, in May 2016.

- Woods' friend described him as a gentle person who was brutally attacked with a knuckleduster.

- It suggests that radical Islam and the gay community cannot coexist, as exemplified by Woods' experience.","**Homophobic Attack on Local Man Highlights Tensions Between Communities**

In a disturbing incident that has drawn attention to the ongoing struggles faced by the LGBTQ+ community, Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual, was brutally attacked in May 2016. The assault occurred when Woods was approached by a man who unleashed a torrent of homophobic slurs before physically assaulting him. The attack left Woods with a broken jaw, a painful reminder of the violence that can stem from intolerance.

Witnesses to the incident reported that the assailant shouted phrases related to ""Muslim stuff"" during the attack, raising questions about the motivations behind the violence. Woods' friend described him as a gentle person, emphasizing the shocking nature of the brutality he faced. The attack was reportedly carried out with a knuckleduster, underscoring the premeditated nature of the assault.

This incident is not isolated; earlier in May, a similar attack occurred involving a gay couple, further highlighting a troubling trend of violence against the LGBTQ+ community. In response to these incidents, Sussex police confirmed that prompt arrests were made in both cases, and they reported that the victims were on the path to recovery.

The attacks have sparked discussions about the broader societal implications of such violence, particularly in relation to the acceptance of the gay community and the teachings of certain religious doctrines. The article draws a stark contrast between the values of acceptance prevalent in the LGBTQ+ community and the teachings of Shariah law, which traditionally condemns homosexuality. This juxtaposition raises critical questions about the coexistence of radical ideologies and the rights of individuals to live freely and authentically.

The experience of Aaron Woods serves as a poignant example of the challenges faced by the gay community in a world where radical beliefs can lead to violence and discrimination. As society grapples with these issues, it becomes increasingly clear that the fight for acceptance and equality is far from over. The incidents in May serve as a reminder of the work that still needs to be done to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, can live without fear of violence or persecution.",-26.0,-45.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,391.0,-3.2142857142857144,-0.11508951406649616
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On Saturday night, a shocking incident unfolded at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, when a man dressed in a security uniform launched a violent attack on shoppers, leaving nine people injured. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" during the attack, raising alarm and fear among those present.

Witnesses recounted the harrowing moments as Adan moved through the mall, asking at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing them. This chilling detail has left many in the community grappling with the implications of such targeted violence. The St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly identified Adan as the attacker, and in a troubling development, ISIS later claimed him as one of their own, further complicating the narrative surrounding the incident.

The attack occurred against a backdrop of heightened tensions and recent incidents of terrorism across the United States. Just prior to the St. Cloud attack, a bomb was detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, and a separate incident involving a meat cleaver attack on New York police officers had also made headlines. These events have raised concerns about the safety of public spaces and the potential for further acts of violence.

In the wake of the attack, community members expressed their support for Adan's family, describing him as a good man and an accomplished student. This sentiment reflects the complexity of the situation, as many in the Somali-American community are now facing the dual challenge of mourning the violence while also defending their community against the stigma that may arise from the actions of one individual.

The situation escalated when off-duty police officer Jason Falconer intervened during the attack. In a decisive moment, Falconer fatally shot Adan after he lunged at him, effectively ending the assault and preventing further injuries. Falconer's actions have been praised by many as heroic, highlighting the critical role of law enforcement in responding to such emergencies.

The incident has reignited discussions about the Somali community in Minnesota, particularly in light of the nearly 10,000 Somali refugees who were relocated to the state during the Obama administration. While many Somali-Americans have successfully integrated into American society, there are ongoing concerns about the vulnerability of some individuals to recruitment by extremist groups like ISIS and al-Shabab. 

The article notes previous convictions of Somali-Americans for collaborating with Islamist groups, which has fueled fears about the potential for radicalization within the community. The attack in St. Cloud has raised alarms about the safety of American malls, with experts warning that such public spaces could be targets for future attacks.

The growing strength of ISIS in Somalia, coupled with support from Yemen, has further complicated the landscape of terrorism. The conviction of three Somalians in Minnesota for attempting to join ISIS underscores the ongoing threat posed by extremist ideologies. As the nation grapples with these issues, there are concerns about the potential for increased Muslim refugee resettlement under a future Clinton administration, which some critics argue could exacerbate the problem of domestic terrorism.

The article takes a strong political stance, suggesting that Hillary Clinton's policies would lead to increased terrorism in the United States. It urges voters to consider the implications of their choices in the upcoming election, advocating for support of Donald Trump as a means to combat the threat of terrorism and ensure the safety of American citizens.

As the St. Cloud community begins to process the events of that fateful night, the attack serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration, integration, and the ongoing battle against extremism. The aftermath of the incident will likely have lasting effects on the community, as residents seek to heal while also addressing the broader societal issues that have been brought to the forefront.

In the days following the attack, local leaders and community organizations have called for unity and understanding, emphasizing the importance of coming together to combat hate and violence. The Somali-American community, in particular, is working to distance itself from the actions of Adan, striving to highlight the positive contributions of its members to the fabric of American society.

As investigations continue and the community seeks answers, the St. Cloud mall attack stands as a poignant example of the challenges faced by immigrant communities in the United States. The incident has sparked conversations about identity, belonging, and the need for vigilance in the face of extremism, reminding all that the fight against terrorism is a collective responsibility that transcends individual actions.

In conclusion, the St. Cloud mall attack has left an indelible mark on the community, prompting reflection on the complexities of immigration, the threat of radicalization, and the importance of solidarity in the face of adversity. As the nation watches closely, the hope is that lessons learned from this tragedy will lead to a more inclusive and understanding society, where diversity is celebrated and the specter of violence is diminished.",-72.0,-29.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,925.0,-0.7631578947368421,-0.03135135135135135
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, the millennial generation has often been characterized as the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" a label that reflects a perceived decline in standards for victimhood. This narrative has gained traction in various discussions, particularly in the context of individuals who commit acts of violence while simultaneously claiming victim status. A notable example of this phenomenon is Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the New Jersey and New York City bombings.

Rahami, who has been linked to a series of bombings in 2016, previously positioned himself as a victim of ""Islamophobia."" This claim was part of a broader narrative that he and his family constructed, which included a lawsuit against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department. Filed in 2011, the lawsuit alleged that the Rahami family faced discrimination based on their Muslim faith, particularly in relation to their chicken restaurant, First American.

The lawsuit claimed that local law enforcement subjected the Rahami family to ""selective enforcement"" and discrimination. The family alleged that they were targeted by police due to their religion, which they argued led to a hostile environment for their business. Additionally, they reported experiencing racial abuse from local residents, with statements such as ""Muslims don’t belong here"" being cited as evidence of the discrimination they faced.

Mayor Christian Bollwage of Elizabeth, however, denied the claims of discrimination, asserting that the complaints against the Rahami family were rooted in legitimate concerns regarding noise and street congregation issues rather than any bias against their religion. This response highlights the complexities of the situation, where the lines between legitimate grievances and claims of victimhood can become blurred.

Despite the Rahami family's efforts to seek redress through the legal system, their lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful. This failure to achieve recognition of their grievances may have contributed to Rahami's subsequent actions, culminating in the bombings that shocked both New Jersey and New York City. The tragic outcome raises questions about the narratives of victimhood that can emerge in the wake of such incidents, particularly when individuals resort to violence to express their perceived injustices.

Critics of the situation argue that it reflects a troubling trend where individuals, including terrorists, adopt a victim narrative to justify their actions. This perspective suggests that the portrayal of victimhood can be manipulated, leading to a dangerous cycle where grievances are used as a rationale for violence. The case of Ahmad Khan Rahami serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding victimhood, discrimination, and the potential consequences of unresolved grievances.

As society grapples with these issues, it becomes increasingly important to examine the narratives that individuals construct around their identities and experiences. The interplay between victimhood and accountability remains a critical area of discussion, particularly in the context of acts of violence that disrupt communities and challenge the very fabric of society.",-38.0,-46.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,544.0,-2.4210526315789473,-0.08455882352941177
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to move businesses if employees don't vote in their favor.

As the political landscape heats up ahead of the upcoming election, a troubling trend has emerged where employers are leveraging threats to influence their employees' voting behavior. Historically, many employers have warned workers that failure to vote in favor of their interests could result in businesses relocating or downsizing. This tactic raises significant concerns about the implications for workers, particularly in industries where job security is already tenuous.

One prominent figure in this debate is Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Puzder has made headlines for his explicit threats regarding the potential for increased automation in his restaurants should a Democrat win the election. His comments resonate with those made by former CEO ""Papa"" John Schnatter during the last presidential election, highlighting a pattern of corporate leaders using fear tactics to sway employee votes.

Puzder's plans for automation include the implementation of systems like Eatsa, which significantly reduces human interaction in the dining experience. This shift towards automation raises critical questions about the future of employment in the fast-food industry. Puzder argues that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses, suggesting that the benefits of higher wages for some may come at the expense of others losing their jobs. This perspective reflects a broader concern that voting in favor of employers often leads to negative outcomes for workers, including outsourcing and stagnant wages.

With approximately 20,000 employees under his leadership, Puzder aims to influence not only his workforce but also other low-wage workers to vote against their own interests. His approach raises ethical questions about the responsibilities of employers in the political arena and the potential consequences for employees who may feel pressured to conform to their employer's political preferences.

In addition to his corporate responsibilities, Puzder maintains a blog where he discusses politics and capitalism. This platform allows him to share his views and potentially shape the opinions of his employees regarding economic systems. However, it also raises questions about how his employees perceive capitalism, especially in light of the significant earnings he has amassed—nearly $4.5 million in 2012—while his employees have not shared in these financial gains.

The looming threat of automation and the pressure to vote in favor of employer interests create a complex environment for workers. As Puzder continues to advocate for automation, it becomes increasingly clear that his priorities lie with profits rather than employee welfare. Regardless of the election outcome, Puzder is expected to push forward with his plans for automation, further diminishing job security for his employees.

This situation highlights a broader trend in the corporate world, where the interests of employers often overshadow the needs and rights of workers. As the election approaches, it is crucial for employees to navigate these pressures and consider the long-term implications of their voting choices. The fear of job loss and the threat of automation serve as stark reminders of the power dynamics at play in the workplace.

In conclusion, the intersection of politics and corporate interests poses significant challenges for workers, particularly in industries vulnerable to automation.

Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a significant development in the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, the FBI has announced that it is examining new evidence that could have serious implications for both Clinton and her close aide, Huma Abedin. This evidence was uncovered during a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Abedin, and it has reignited scrutiny over Clinton's handling of classified information during her tenure as Secretary of State.

The investigation into Weiner, who has faced legal troubles of his own, led to the discovery of a laptop that he shared with Abedin. Reports indicate that this laptop may contain ""tens of thousands of emails"" from Abedin, including emails that were forwarded from Clinton's account. Notably, these emails were not submitted to the FBI during its previous inquiries, raising questions about their content and whether they are work-related or classified. If it is determined that these emails fall into either category, both Clinton and Abedin could potentially face charges for lying to the FBI.

The timing of the FBI's announcement is particularly striking, as it came just 11 days before the presidential election, underscoring the seriousness of the findings. This revelation has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, as Clinton was already under intense scrutiny for her email practices. In July 2016, FBI Director James Comey had outlined evidence against Clinton but ultimately did not recommend charges, a decision that left many within the FBI dissatisfied and questioning the integrity of the investigation.

A high-ranking FBI official has since revealed that there was a strong desire among agents to revoke Clinton's security clearance and pursue prosecution. This sentiment reflects the frustration felt by some within the bureau regarding the handling of the case and the perceived lack of accountability for Clinton's actions.

Further complicating matters, an FBI summary has surfaced that details allegations of pressure from a State Department official to declassify information in exchange for additional agents at diplomatic posts. This summary also references a group of State Department officials, dubbed ""The Shadow Government,"" who were reportedly involved in discussions about Freedom of Information requests related to Clinton's email practices. The existence of such a group raises concerns about transparency and the potential for collusion within government agencies.

In addition to these revelations, it has been reported that Clinton ignored security advice that could have endangered her and others during her campaign, all for the sake of a photo opportunity. This disregard for security protocols has further fueled criticism of her judgment and decision-making during her time in office.

The investigation has also drawn attention to financial contributions made by Clinton supporters. Notably, a Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official involved in the investigation, raising ethical questions about the potential influence of political donations on the investigation's integrity.

Central to the controversy is Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was identified as having deleted over 33,000 emails from Clinton's server. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department, a move that has drawn scrutiny and speculation about the motivations behind the deletion of these emails. The circumstances surrounding Combetta's actions and the immunity deal have become focal points in the broader investigation.

Leaked emails have also suggested that Clinton communicated with President Obama via her private server, contradicting previous claims that he was unaware of her use of a non-government email system. This revelation has raised further questions about the extent of Clinton's email practices and the potential implications for national security.

Evidence has emerged indicating that Clinton personally deleted emails and even instructed Combetta to remove evidence after being subpoenaed. This timeline of events, which includes key dates related to the investigation and the deletion of emails, highlights potential collusion and cover-up efforts that could have serious legal ramifications for those involved.

As the FBI continues its investigation into this new evidence, the political ramifications are likely to be significant. With the election looming, the implications of these findings could influence voter perceptions and the overall political landscape. The investigation into Clinton's email practices has been a contentious issue throughout her political career, and the latest developments are sure to reignite debates over accountability, transparency, and the integrity of public officials.

In conclusion, the FBI's renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, prompted by evidence uncovered during the investigation into Anthony Weiner, has the potential to reshape the narrative surrounding Clinton's candidacy and her handling of classified information. As new details emerge, the implications for both Clinton and Abedin remain to be seen, but the seriousness of the findings cannot be understated. The political fallout from this investigation is likely to reverberate long after the election, as questions of accountability and transparency continue to loom large in the public consciousness.",-6.0,-6.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,901.0,-0.1935483870967742,-0.006659267480577136
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has long championed an open borders policy aimed at accepting Syrian refugees, a stance that has sparked significant debate within the country. While her approach was initially lauded for its humanitarian intent, it has also been met with serious consequences, including a notable increase in crime rates across German cities. Reports indicate that thousands of sexual assaults and violent crimes have been linked to the surge in refugee numbers, leading to growing concerns among the German public.

The backlash against Merkel's policies has been palpable, culminating in a substantial electoral defeat for her conservative Democrat party. This shift in public sentiment reflects a broader discontent with the handling of the migrant crisis, prompting Merkel to publicly acknowledge the challenges that have arisen. In a candid admission, she expressed regret over the situation, suggesting that many of the issues could have been avoided with different strategies.

Merkel's critique of multiculturalism was particularly striking, as she described it as a “living lie.” This statement underscores her recognition of the complexities involved in integrating a large influx of migrants into German society. At her party's annual conference, she reiterated her previous slogan, “we can do this,” while also conceding that the current rate of refugee arrivals could potentially overwhelm the nation.

In response to the mounting pressures, Merkel announced plans to reduce the number of refugees entering Germany. However, she stopped short of committing to a specific limit on arrivals, indicating a cautious approach to the ongoing crisis. Instead, she emphasized the need for a multi-level strategy to regulate and limit migration, focusing on efforts at the German, European, and global levels.

As Germany grapples with the ramifications of its refugee policy, experts warn that similar challenges could emerge in other countries, including the United States. The situation serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities of immigration and the potential consequences of policies aimed at addressing humanitarian needs without adequate planning and support systems in place.",-2.0,-13.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,383.0,-1.0,-0.033942558746736295

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology.

In a striking revelation, a terrorist responsible for planting explosives in New Jersey and New York City is set to receive superior medical care compared to U.S. veterans. This situation has ignited outrage and frustration among many, particularly in light of a 2014 scandal involving the Veteran’s Administration (VA), which was marred by long waiting lists and cover-ups of inefficiency.

During a recent campaign speech, former President Donald Trump highlighted this alarming disparity in care. He pointed out that the terrorist, Ahmad Rahami, will have access to top doctors, modern hospital facilities, and legal representation, all while countless veterans struggle to receive the care they desperately need. Trump’s comments have resonated with many who feel that the system has failed those who have served the country.

The plight of veterans is dire, with over 300,000 individuals having died while waiting for VA care. This staggering statistic underscores the systemic issues within the VA, where many veterans have faced insurmountable obstacles in accessing timely medical treatment. The situation is further exacerbated by the tragic reality of veteran suicides occurring while waiting for care, including heartbreaking incidents in VA parking lots.

The contrast between the treatment of Rahami and that of veterans raises serious questions about the priorities of the healthcare system. While a terrorist receives immediate and comprehensive medical attention, veterans—who have sacrificed so much for their country—are left to navigate a convoluted and often inadequate system. This disparity has sparked a wave of frustration among veterans and their advocates, who are calling for urgent reforms to ensure that those who have served the nation receive the care they deserve.

The author of this article expresses deep concern over the government's failure to provide adequate care for veterans, especially when juxtaposed with the treatment afforded to a convicted terrorist. The situation serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by veterans in accessing healthcare and the urgent need for systemic change within the VA.

As the nation grapples with these issues, the hope remains that the voices of veterans and their families will be heard, leading to meaningful reforms that prioritize their health and well-being. The disparity in care highlighted by Trump and others serves as a rallying cry for those advocating for veterans, emphasizing the need for a system that honors their sacrifices and provides them with the care they rightfully deserve.",13.0,-12.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,450.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.02666666666666667
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more.

In a dramatic incident that unfolded in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, became a hero when he intervened in a violent attack by an ISIS terrorist. The assailant had already stabbed eight people when Falconer, demonstrating his commitment to public safety, took decisive action to neutralize the threat.

Falconer is not only recognized for his bravery but also for his role as the owner of Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., a business dedicated to training law-abiding citizens in concealed carry for self-defense. His work has empowered many individuals to protect themselves and their loved ones, fostering a culture of responsible gun ownership.

However, Falconer now faces a significant threat from the political arena. Hillary Clinton, a prominent figure in the upcoming presidential election, has made it clear that she aims to put Falconer out of business if elected. Her campaign has targeted his firearms training company, raising concerns among supporters of the Second Amendment and those who believe in the right to self-defense.

Clinton's proposed policies could have dire consequences for Falconer’s business, potentially leading to its bankruptcy. A key aspect of her agenda involves removing protections provided by the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). This legislation has been crucial in shielding gun manufacturers and dealers from frivolous lawsuits, allowing businesses like Falconer’s to operate without the constant threat of legal action that could arise from the misuse of firearms.

Critics have pointed out that Clinton's characterization of the PLCAA as offering ""immunity"" to gunmakers and dealers is misleading. The law does not grant blanket immunity; rather, it provides a necessary safeguard that allows responsible businesses to thrive without the fear of being held liable for the actions of criminals. Falconer, who has dedicated his life to protecting citizens first as a law enforcement officer and then through his firearms training company, stands as a testament to the importance of this protection.

The implications of Clinton's stance on gun rights extend beyond Falconer’s business. Many view her approach as a direct threat to the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms. The article argues that her policies could undermine the very foundation of self-defense that individuals like Falconer advocate for. 

As the election approaches, the stakes are high for voters who value their rights and the safety of their communities. The piece encourages citizens to consider the impact of their vote, particularly in relation to candidates who may seek to restrict gun rights and undermine the efforts of those who work tirelessly to protect public safety.

In a time when personal safety is paramount, the actions of individuals like Jason Falconer serve as a reminder of the importance of responsible gun ownership and the right to self-defense. As the political landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for voters to support candidates who align with their values and prioritize the protection of the Second Amendment.

In conclusion, the battle over gun rights is not just a political issue; it is a matter of personal safety and freedom. Voters are urged to reject candidates like Clinton who threaten the livelihoods of those dedicated to protecting citizens, ensuring that heroes like Falconer can continue their vital work in communities across the nation.",-11.0,12.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,622.0,0.5,0.01929260450160772

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election season heats up, the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has emerged as a prominent topic of discussion among voters and political analysts alike. Recent polling data reveals a significant shift in public perception regarding Clinton's health, with many voters expressing concerns that could impact her candidacy.

A recent poll indicates that over 40% of registered voters now believe Clinton is in ""below average"" or ""very poor"" health. This marks a notable increase from just 26% in late August, highlighting a growing unease among the electorate. In contrast, the percentage of voters who consider Clinton's health to be ""average"" has remained steady at 28%, suggesting that while some voters are increasingly worried, others maintain a neutral stance.

The perception of Clinton's health stands in stark contrast to that of her political rival, Donald Trump. The same poll shows that the number of voters who view Trump's health as ""above average"" or ""excellent"" has risen from 33% to 36%. In comparison, only 22% of voters hold a similar view of Clinton's health, further emphasizing the disparity between the two candidates.

Awareness of Clinton's potential medical issues is widespread, with nearly 80% of respondents acknowledging concerns about her health. At 68 years old, Clinton is perceived to look older than her age, which has only intensified scrutiny regarding her fitness for office. Speculation surrounding her health has been fueled by various reports, including her use of Coumadin, a medication typically prescribed for blood clotting issues, and her research into Provigil, a drug associated with serious medical conditions.

Public concern has been exacerbated by several high-profile incidents where Clinton appeared to struggle physically. Observers have noted instances where she seemed to pass out, stumble, or experience coughing fits during public appearances. These moments have not gone unnoticed, leading to increased speculation about her overall well-being and ability to handle the rigors of a presidential campaign.

Photographic evidence has also contributed to the narrative surrounding Clinton's health. Images capturing her needing assistance to navigate stairs or being physically supported during events have raised eyebrows and prompted questions about her stamina and resilience. Such visuals have fueled discussions about whether she is fit to serve as president, should she secure the nomination.

Adding to the intrigue, there are claims that videos documenting Clinton's health incidents have been removed from the internet, suggesting a possible attempt to conceal information from the public. This has only intensified the scrutiny surrounding her health, as voters are left to wonder what might be hidden from view.

Clinton's coughing fits during speeches have become a focal point of concern for many voters. Observations of her struggling to maintain composure while addressing crowds have led to widespread speculation about her health and its implications for her candidacy. As a result, the narrative surrounding her health has become a significant factor in the ongoing election discourse.

The implications of these health concerns are profound, as they could influence voter sentiment and decision-making as the election approaches. With a substantial portion of the electorate expressing doubts about Clinton's health, her campaign may need to address these issues head-on to reassure voters of her capability to lead.

As the election cycle progresses, it remains to be seen how Clinton will navigate the growing concerns about her health. The stakes are high, and with public perception playing a crucial role in electoral outcomes, addressing these issues may become a priority for her campaign team.

In conclusion, Hillary Clinton's health has become a critical topic in the current presidential election landscape. With increasing numbers of voters expressing concerns about her well-being, the former Secretary of State faces a challenging road ahead. As the election draws nearer, how she addresses these health-related issues could significantly impact her candidacy and the overall dynamics of the race.",-11.0,21.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,740.0,0.7241379310344828,0.02837837837837838

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle has stirred the political waters with the release of her tell-all book, ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which offers a scathing portrayal of Bill and Hillary Clinton. The book delves into Hillary's aggressive demeanor towards those she perceives as inferior, painting a picture of a woman who is not only ambitious but also dismissive of others.

Kyle, who has a personal history with Bill Clinton, recounts their high school romance and subsequent sexual relationship after graduation. This intimate connection provides a unique perspective on the former president and his wife, as Kyle shares her experiences and observations from their time together.

Among the more shocking allegations in the book are claims that the Clintons have used racial epithets and held controversial political attitudes. One particularly troubling incident described by Kyle occurred during an Easter egg hunt for developmentally challenged children, where Hillary reportedly expressed her frustration by saying, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?” This statement has raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about Hillary's views on those she considers less fortunate.

Kyle also portrays Hillary as looking down on the people of Arkansas, referring to them as ""ignorant hillbillies."" Raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois, Hillary is depicted as having a sense of superiority over the southern population, which may have contributed to the Clintons' growing discontent with their time in Arkansas.

As the Clintons sought to elevate their political ambitions, Bill Clinton ultimately opted out of running for reelection in 1990, setting his sights on a presidential run. Kyle's revelations in ""Hillary: The Other Woman"" are sure to reignite debates about the Clintons' legacy and their impact on American politics.",-10.0,-10.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,336.0,-1.0,-0.02976190476190476

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking ruling, a Massachusetts judge has established a special law that permits black males to flee from police officers without facing legal consequences. This decision, which is now in effect and cannot be appealed, has sparked significant debate regarding its implications for public safety and law enforcement practices.

The judge's ruling stems from concerns about the fear that some black Americans experience in encounters with police officers. This fear, the judge argues, often leads to a tendency among individuals to flee when approached by law enforcement. By allowing those who feel ""disproportionately"" targeted to run from police without repercussions, the ruling aims to address these fears but raises questions about the potential risks to public safety.

Historically, fleeing from a police officer could establish ""reasonable suspicion,"" enabling law enforcement to detain and investigate individuals. However, the new law fundamentally alters this dynamic, effectively undermining the ability of police officers to protect and serve their communities. With individuals now permitted to evade police pursuit without penalty, concerns are mounting about the potential for increased danger to citizens.

Critics of the ruling express skepticism about its broader implications, suggesting that it may inadvertently benefit those with criminal intent. By providing a legal avenue for individuals to flee from police, the law could embolden those who might otherwise comply with law enforcement. This shift in legal precedent raises alarms about the potential for a rise in criminal activity, as individuals may feel empowered to escape accountability.

The ruling has ignited a heated discussion among community leaders, law enforcement officials, and legal experts. Proponents argue that the law is a necessary step toward addressing systemic issues within the criminal justice system, particularly the disproportionate targeting of black males. They contend that the ruling acknowledges the legitimate fears that many individuals face in their interactions with police.

Conversely, opponents warn that the law could lead to a breakdown in the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The inability to pursue fleeing individuals may hinder police efforts to maintain order and ensure public safety. As the ruling takes effect, the potential consequences for both law enforcement and community members remain uncertain.

As Massachusetts navigates this uncharted legal territory, the implications of the judge's decision will likely continue to unfold. The balance between addressing community concerns and ensuring public safety is a delicate one, and the ruling has undoubtedly added a new layer of complexity to this ongoing dialogue. As stakeholders grapple with the ramifications, the conversation surrounding police interactions and community trust is more critical than ever.",-13.0,-19.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,492.0,-0.95,-0.03861788617886179
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

In his remarks, Sansaricq criticized the response to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, asserting that corruption overshadowed the essential aid that was needed during that crisis.

Despite billions of dollars reportedly funneled into the Clinton Foundation, Sansaricq lamented that the Haitian people continue to endure significant suffering, with many still living in tents years after the disaster. He accused the Clintons of exploiting the tragedy for personal gain, raising serious concerns about the transparency of the funds allocated for relief efforts. Sansaricq questioned the reasons behind the failure to deliver aid effectively to those in need.

His statements resonate with themes presented in Peter Schweizer’s book ""Clinton Cash,"" which scrutinizes the financial dealings of the Clintons. At a recent Trump rally, Sansaricq went further, alleging that former President Bill Clinton attempted to bribe him, which he claims led to the revocation of his visa after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed that she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance to turn back time. This revelation comes in the wake of the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) disappointing performance in recent elections in Berlin, which has been interpreted as a reflection of the growing anti-migrant sentiment in Germany.

Merkel's comments signal a potential shift in her approach to refugee policy, as she acknowledged her unpreparedness for the challenges posed by the 2015 refugee crisis. Taking responsibility for the CDU's poor election results, she indicated a willingness to consider new policy directions regarding refugees, a topic that has become increasingly contentious in German politics.

The election results have underscored the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has capitalized on public discontent regarding immigration. The AfD's growing influence is indicative of a broader societal shift, with many voters expressing concerns about the implications of Merkel's open-door policy. The atmosphere surrounding migration has been further complicated by fears of increased terrorism and crime associated with refugees, which critics argue have been exacerbated by the influx of migrants.

Despite her regrets about the past, Merkel has firmly dismissed calls from the Christian Social Union (CSU) for a cap on the number of migrants entering Germany. The CSU, a sister party to the CDU, has advocated for prioritizing Christian migrants over Muslim asylum-seekers, a proposal that Merkel has rejected outright. She emphasized that such discrimination against Muslim asylum-seekers contradicts the principles of her party and the core values of Germany.

The tension between Merkel and the CSU has been palpable, particularly during the lead-up to the 2017 campaign when CSU leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkel over the contentious issue of a migrant cap. This internal strife highlights the challenges Merkel faces as she navigates the complex landscape of German politics, where immigration remains a divisive topic.

As the political climate continues to shift, there are growing concerns that Merkel could encounter significant challenges in the upcoming federal election. The CDU's recent electoral setbacks suggest that her policies may not resonate with an electorate increasingly wary of immigration. The rise of the AfD and the growing anti-migrant sentiment could pose a formidable obstacle for Merkel as she seeks to maintain her party's influence and secure her legacy.

In summary, Merkel's reflections on her migrant policy reveal a leader grappling with the consequences of her decisions during a pivotal moment in German history. While she acknowledges the need for potential changes, her commitment to rejecting discriminatory practices against Muslim asylum-seekers underscores her dedication to upholding Germany's values. As the political landscape evolves, the implications of her policies will undoubtedly continue to shape the discourse surrounding migration in Germany.",-14.0,-15.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,526.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.028517110266159697
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In a disturbing incident that has drawn attention to issues of domestic violence and the treatment of women, Abdullah, a Somali asylum seeker residing in Sundsvall, Sweden, was arrested following a brutal assault on his pregnant wife. Known to local police for a history of violent crimes, Abdullah has been living off welfare benefits since his arrival in Sweden five years ago.

The incident unfolded after Abdullah returned home from a night out with friends. Prior to his return, he had demanded that his wife’s niece, whom she was babysitting, leave the premises. However, upon discovering that the niece was still present, Abdullah reacted with extreme violence. Witnesses report that he physically attacked his wife, kicking her in the head and stomach, leaving her in a state of distress and fear.

The assault did not end there. In a further act of humiliation, Abdullah poured beer over his wife and urinated on her, actions that have sparked outrage and condemnation from various community members and advocates for women's rights. This incident raises serious concerns about the safety and well-being of women in domestic situations, particularly among vulnerable populations.

The case has also ignited discussions surrounding the interpretation of religious texts and their implications for behavior. Abdullah's actions have been juxtaposed with Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. Critics have pointed out the selective adherence to Islamic teachings displayed by Abdullah, who, while invoking religious justification for his actions, simultaneously engages in behavior that contradicts the very principles he claims to uphold. His consumption of alcohol and abandonment of his wife further highlight the hypocrisy in his actions.

This incident is not an isolated case but rather part of a broader pattern of domestic violence that affects many women, particularly those in marginalized communities. Advocates are calling for increased support and resources for victims of domestic abuse, emphasizing the need for comprehensive measures to protect women and hold perpetrators accountable.

As the investigation continues, Abdullah remains in custody, and the community is left grappling with the implications of this violent act. Local authorities are urged to take a firm stance against domestic violence and to provide necessary support for victims, ensuring that such incidents do not become a recurring theme in the lives of those seeking refuge and safety.

The case serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by asylum seekers and the complexities of integrating into a new society. It highlights the urgent need for education and awareness around issues of domestic violence, cultural sensitivity, and the importance of respecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their background.

As the community of Sundsvall reflects on this troubling event, it is clear that more must be done to protect vulnerable individuals and to foster an environment where respect and equality prevail. The hope is that this incident will lead to meaningful discussions and actions that can prevent future occurrences of such violence.",-28.0,-49.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,554.0,-2.3333333333333335,-0.08844765342960288
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, Pennsylvania Republicans are advocating for House Bill 29, legislation that would permit voter intimidation on Election Day. First introduced in June, the bill aims to allow non-residents to monitor polling places and challenge voters, raising concerns about potential disruptions to the voting process.

Critics of the bill, including Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice, have voiced strong opposition, warning that the legislation could lead to discriminatory challenges against voters. Gitlin emphasized that such measures could result in longer wait times at polling stations, further complicating an already tense electoral environment. The implications of this bill are particularly alarming for many, as there are fears that it could discourage and intimidate voters, especially those from minority groups who may already face barriers to participation.

The push for this bill comes in the wake of former President Donald Trump’s calls for his supporters to monitor polling areas. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the upcoming election could be rigged against him, a narrative that has fueled a sense of urgency among his followers to take action at the polls. This rhetoric has raised alarms among voting rights advocates, who argue that it could incite aggressive behavior and create a hostile environment for voters.

An amendment to House Bill 29 has been proposed that would allow the legislation to take effect immediately upon passage, rather than waiting the customary 60 days. This expedited timeline has raised further concerns among critics, who fear that the bill could be enacted before adequate safeguards are put in place to protect voters.

The stakes are particularly high in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that is crucial for Trump and the Republican Party. With the race expected to be closely contested, the potential for voter intimidation could significantly influence the outcome of the election. Observers worry that if House Bill 29 is successful, it could set a precedent for similar tactics to be employed in other states by Republican lawmakers.

As the debate over House Bill 29 continues, the implications for voter rights and the integrity of the electoral process remain a focal point of concern. Advocates for fair voting practices are mobilizing to challenge the bill, emphasizing the need to protect the rights of all voters and ensure that elections are conducted without fear or intimidation.

The situation in Pennsylvania serves as a critical reminder of the ongoing struggles surrounding voting rights in the United States. As the election approaches, the eyes of the nation will be on Pennsylvania, where the outcome could have far-reaching consequences not only for the state but for the political landscape as a whole.

In conclusion, the push for House Bill 29 by Pennsylvania Republicans has ignited a fierce debate over voter intimidation and its potential impact on the electoral process. With the support of influential figures like Donald Trump, the bill poses a significant threat to the integrity of voting in the state. As advocates work to combat this legislation, the future of fair elections hangs in the balance, underscoring the importance of vigilance in protecting democratic rights.",-19.0,-16.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,574.0,-0.8,-0.027874564459930314

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an American Olympian fencer, made history as the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab. Her groundbreaking achievement has not only inspired many but also brought to light the challenges faced by Muslim women in the United States. Despite her success, Muhammad has expressed feelings of insecurity, recounting a troubling incident where someone followed her home with the intent to report her to the police. This experience underscores the ongoing struggles against prejudice and discrimination that many individuals face.

In her reflections, Muhammad highlighted the severity of racist incidents in the U.S., drawing attention to the tragic shooting in North Carolina and the negative rhetoric surrounding the Khan family during the Democratic National Convention. These events serve as stark reminders of the challenges that marginalized communities continue to confront.

While some may label America as an ""Islamophobic"" country, the article presents a counterargument, noting that hate crimes against Jews occur at a higher rate than those against Muslims. This statistic raises questions about the broader context of discrimination and the complexities of societal issues in the U.S.

The article further probes Muhammad's decision to remain in the United States, questioning why she continues to live in a country she perceives as so hostile. It suggests that conditions in many Muslim-majority countries may be far worse, prompting a discussion about the freedoms and safety that America offers. The author contrasts the liberties Muhammad enjoys in the U.S. with the potential dangers present in some Muslim countries, where practices such as stoning, genital mutilation, and harsh punishments for crimes are prevalent.

In conclusion, Ibtihaj Muhammad's journey as an Olympian and her candid discussions about insecurity and racism highlight the complexities of identity and belonging in America. Her story serves as a powerful reminder of the ongoing fight against discrimination and the importance of fostering understanding and acceptance in society.",-23.0,-14.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,357.0,-1.0769230769230769,-0.0392156862745098
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In recent days, the city of Charlotte has witnessed a troubling escalation of protests that have devolved into riots, following a police shooting involving a black officer and a black suspect. What began as a demonstration has transformed into a scene of chaos, raising serious questions about the motivations and actions of those involved.

The protests, initially sparked by the shooting, have taken a dark turn, with many participants engaging in behavior that can only be described as thuggish. Rather than fostering a dialogue or seeking justice through peaceful means, these individuals have chosen to wreak havoc on their own community. The actions of these protesters have not only undermined their cause but have also instigated fear and disorder among residents and law enforcement alike.

One particularly disturbing incident highlights the troubling mindset of some protesters. Instead of offering assistance to an injured police officer, rioters were seen mocking him, reveling in the chaos they had created. This moment encapsulates the irresponsible and violent nature of the protests, showcasing a complete disregard for human life and the principles of solidarity that should guide any movement advocating for justice.

The author of this piece expresses deep disdain for the actions of the protesters, labeling them as irresponsible and violent. It is perplexing to witness individuals who claim to stand for justice and equality resorting to such destructive behavior. If the supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement genuinely valued black lives, one would expect them to engage in peaceful protests rather than inflict harm on one another and their community.

The sweeping generalizations made about the character and behavior of Black Lives Matter supporters paint a troubling picture. The portrayal of these individuals as chaotic and violent detracts from the legitimate concerns that may exist within the movement. However, the actions witnessed in Charlotte cannot be overlooked. They raise critical questions about the integrity and intentions of those who participate in such protests.

The conclusion drawn from these events is a strong condemnation of the Black Lives Matter movement and its supporters. The actions of the rioters in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder that the path to justice cannot be paved with violence and chaos. If the movement is to be taken seriously, it must distance itself from those who engage in such behavior and reaffirm its commitment to peaceful advocacy.

As the city grapples with the aftermath of these protests, it is essential for community leaders and activists to reflect on the implications of their actions. The call for justice must be accompanied by a commitment to non-violence and respect for all lives, including those of law enforcement officers. Only then can a constructive dialogue emerge, paving the way for meaningful change.

In the wake of the riots, it is crucial for the community to come together and address the underlying issues that have led to such unrest. While the concerns surrounding police violence and systemic racism are valid, they must be addressed through peaceful means. The actions of a few should not define the entire movement, but the responsibility lies with the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement to ensure that their message is not overshadowed by the chaos of a riot.

The events in Charlotte serve as a cautionary tale for all who seek to advocate for change. Violence begets violence, and the cycle of chaos only serves to alienate potential allies and undermine the very cause that protesters claim to champion. It is time for a reevaluation of tactics and a recommitment to the principles of peace and justice that should guide any movement for social change.

In conclusion, the riots in Charlotte have exposed a troubling reality within the protests that have emerged in response to police violence. The actions of those who have chosen chaos over constructive dialogue must be condemned, and the movement must strive to uphold the values it claims to represent. Only through accountability and a commitment to non-violence can true progress be achieved.",-83.0,-74.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,733.0,-2.466666666666667,-0.1009549795361528
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In a poignant farewell to the international community, President Obama delivered his final speech at the United Nations General Assembly, a moment that has ignited significant debate among critics and supporters alike. Characterized by many as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal, Obama has faced scrutiny throughout his presidency for various policies, including the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and an increasing acceptance of refugees.

During his address, Obama advocated for a one world order and emphasized the importance of international governance. He suggested that, in the pursuit of global security, the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms. However, he firmly stated that the right to self-defense should remain inviolable, a point that resonated with some while raising eyebrows among others.

The speech did not shy away from acknowledging the criticism he has faced from Americans regarding his views on global cooperation and governance. Despite the backlash, Obama remained steadfast in his beliefs, a stance that has drawn frustration from those who perceive his approach as arrogant and uncompromising.

The divisiveness in Washington D.C. has been a persistent theme throughout Obama's presidency, and his final address only served to highlight the challenges of fostering cooperation among representatives. Many question the feasibility of achieving bipartisan support in an increasingly polarized political landscape, especially when proposals for global governance are on the table.

As Obama exits the stage of international politics, his legacy remains a topic of heated discussion. While some applaud his vision for a more interconnected world, others express concern over the implications of sacrificing individual freedoms for the sake of collective security. The debate surrounding his policies and ideals is likely to continue, reflecting the broader tensions that define contemporary American politics.",13.0,15.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,332.0,1.25,0.045180722891566265
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of professional football, two names stand out, albeit for different reasons: Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. Both former starting quarterbacks have found themselves on the sidelines in the NFL, but their paths and public perceptions could not be more divergent.

Tim Tebow, known for his positive demeanor and respectability, has garnered admiration from fans and peers alike. In contrast, Kaepernick has faced significant criticism, with some labeling him an ""idiot"" for his controversial actions. The divide between these two figures highlights not only their differing approaches to their careers but also their contrasting views on social issues.

Tebow has been notably reserved in his comments regarding Kaepernick's National Anthem protest, which sparked widespread debate across the nation. While he acknowledges the importance of standing up for one’s beliefs, he emphasizes that such expressions should be conducted in a manner that respects the game and its fans. Tebow suggests that Kaepernick, who has become a high-paid bench player, is being disrespectful to both the fans and the American public by choosing to protest during games rather than on his own time.

The article further delves into the broader implications of Kaepernick's actions, arguing that claims of oppression in the United States are unfounded. It posits that no one in the country is truly oppressed, asserting that such claims are often excuses for laziness. The author references the presidency of Barack Obama as a counterpoint to the notion of systemic oppression, suggesting that the former president's election serves as evidence against the idea that individuals face insurmountable barriers based on race or background.

This perspective challenges the narrative surrounding Kaepernick's protest, suggesting that the issues he raises stem more from personal choices than from any societal constraints. The article implies that individuals have the power to shape their destinies and that attributing failure or dissatisfaction to external oppression is misguided.

Tebow, for his part, has managed to maintain a clean public image, steering clear of negative press while focusing on his aspirations, including a potential career with the New York Mets. His commitment to positivity and respect has resonated with many, further solidifying his status as a role model in the eyes of his supporters.

As the debate continues, the article concludes with a dismissive remark towards Kaepernick, encapsulating the sentiment that while both players may share a similar fate in the NFL, their legacies and the ways they engage with social issues are worlds apart. In the end, the contrasting narratives of Tebow and Kaepernick serve as a reflection of the broader cultural conversations taking place in America today.",-6.0,-8.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,497.0,-0.47058823529411764,-0.01609657947686117
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

The ongoing debate surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border wall has intensified, with proponents emphasizing its role as a crucial national security measure beyond merely curbing illegal immigration. Historical parallels are drawn to China's Great Wall, which was constructed to fend off foreign invaders rather than to restrict the movement of people. This perspective underscores the wall's significance in safeguarding the nation from various threats.

The situation in Mexico, where drug cartels exert considerable control, has exacerbated concerns about security. The violence and instability associated with these criminal organizations contribute to a high death toll, raising alarms about the potential for further chaos spilling over into the United States. The unsecured Southern Border is viewed as a vulnerability that could be exploited by terrorist groups, including ISIS, to infiltrate the country.

Recent events have highlighted these fears. Eight Syrian nationals were intercepted while attempting to illegally enter the U.S. from Mexico, a stark reminder of the potential risks posed by an open border. The apprehension occurred at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, prompting local authorities to take immediate action. Hector Garza, President of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, expressed growing concerns among agents regarding the increasing number of Syrian crossings, indicating a troubling trend that could have serious implications for national security.

Border Patrol agents face significant challenges in managing the influx of illegal entrants, compounded by limited resources. Garza noted that a staggering 80% of individuals caught attempting to cross the border illegally are not deported, raising questions about the effectiveness of current enforcement measures. This statistic underscores the urgent need for a more robust approach to border security.

In light of these developments, there is a renewed emphasis on the necessity for stronger border security measures. Advocates are rallying behind presidential candidates who prioritize this issue, seeking to ensure that national security remains a top priority. The call for action is clear: as threats evolve, so too must the strategies employed to protect the nation.

The border wall, therefore, is not merely a physical barrier but a symbol of a broader commitment to safeguarding the United States from both illegal immigration and potential security threats. As the situation continues to unfold, the conversation surrounding border security will undoubtedly remain at the forefront of national discourse.",-13.0,-33.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,436.0,-1.8333333333333333,-0.07568807339449542

These people LOVED Trump. They cheered for him, he sat quietly as they told their stories.

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

In a recent gathering, a group of Haitians expressed their support for former President Donald Trump, cheering enthusiastically as he listened to their personal stories. The atmosphere was charged with positive sentiments towards Trump, who appeared engaged with the audience's experiences.

However, the media's presence at the event was short-lived. Reporters departed early, seemingly uninterested in the audience's perspectives and complaints. Many attendees voiced their dissatisfaction with the Clintons, particularly highlighting a perceived lack of follow-up after donations were made to aid Haiti. This sentiment was echoed by a belief that funds intended for the country's recovery were misappropriated, benefiting Washington lobbyists rather than the Haitian people.

The audience's frustration extended to Hillary Clinton, whom they accused of obstructing efforts to raise Haiti's daily minimum wage from a meager $3 to $5. This issue resonated deeply with the attendees, who felt that their struggles were being overlooked.

As the crowd's support for Trump and criticism of Hillary Clinton became increasingly apparent, the media chose to exit the event, finding no newsworthy content to report. Their early departure has drawn criticism, with some suggesting it reflects a broader trend of media neglecting the voices of those directly affected by political decisions. The audience's passionate expressions of support for Trump and their grievances against the Clintons were left unheard, raising questions about the media's commitment to covering the full spectrum of public opinion.",-2.0,-12.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,279.0,-1.0909090909090908,-0.043010752688172046
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate of heightened concern over terrorism, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reignited a contentious debate by proposing a ban on Muslim immigration until a better understanding of terrorism can be achieved. This proposal has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who have labeled it as racist. However, an article discussing the implications of Trump's stance argues that racism is fundamentally tied to race, not religion, suggesting that the discourse surrounding Islam and immigration should be viewed through a different lens.

The article posits that Islam, as a religion, has elements that can lead to radicalization, citing various extremist actions that have occurred globally. This perspective has found resonance in Australia, where a recent poll indicates a significant shift in public opinion regarding Muslim immigration. The poll reveals that 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration, a notable increase from just 28% last October. This surge in support reflects growing concerns about national security and the integration of Muslim migrants into Australian society.

Moreover, the poll highlights that 48% of voters are in favor of initiating a national debate on the issue, suggesting that many Australians are eager to engage in discussions about the implications of immigration policies. The findings also reveal that two-thirds of Australians believe populist senator Pauline Hanson addresses topics that other politicians tend to avoid, indicating a demand for more candid conversations about immigration and its challenges.

The primary reasons cited by supporters of a ban on Muslim immigration include fears of terrorism and apprehensions regarding the integration of Muslim migrants into Australian values. The poll data shows that support for ending Muslim migration is particularly strong among right-wing Coalition voters, with 60% in favor. Additionally, 40% of Labour voters and 34% of Green voters also express support for the ban, illustrating that the issue transcends traditional party lines and resonates with a broader segment of the population.

The pollster behind the survey expressed surprise at the significant level of support for the ban, suggesting that it reflects deeper societal views and concerns that may not have been fully acknowledged in mainstream political discourse. This shift in public sentiment raises important questions about the future of immigration policy in Australia and the potential for more stringent measures in response to perceived threats.

In the context of this debate, the article critiques the approach taken by political figures such as Hillary Clinton, who have opposed views like Trump's without engaging with the underlying concerns of the electorate. The article argues that acknowledging dissenting opinions and addressing the fears that drive support for such proposals may be a more effective strategy in fostering constructive dialogue.

As the conversation around Muslim immigration continues to evolve, it is clear that the Australian public is increasingly willing to confront the complexities of this issue. The growing support for a ban, coupled with a desire for national debate, suggests that immigration policy will remain a pivotal topic in Australian politics. With fears of terrorism and integration at the forefront of public consciousness, the challenge for policymakers will be to navigate these concerns while upholding the values of inclusivity and diversity that Australia is known for.

In conclusion, the debate surrounding Muslim immigration is not merely a reflection of individual opinions but rather a manifestation of broader societal anxieties. As Australia grapples with these issues, the need for open dialogue and understanding will be crucial in shaping the future of its immigration policies.",2.0,12.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,643.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01866251944012442

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a shocking turn of events, a chaotic incident unfolded in the middle of a street, where a fight was anticipated. What began as a typical altercation quickly escalated into a disturbing scene when an individual unexpectedly set those involved in the fight on fire. Eyewitnesses described the atmosphere as chaotic, with people running in all directions, perilously close to oncoming traffic.

The incident has sparked significant discussion, particularly regarding the mindset of the person who threw the Molotov cocktail. The author of a recent commentary questions whether this act was impulsive or if it stemmed from a more premeditated intention. Such a violent response raises concerns about the motivations behind such actions and the broader implications for community safety.

In reflecting on the incident, the author contrasts current behaviors with a nostalgic view of the past. There was a time when bystanders would intervene to prevent harm during fights, stepping in to protect those in danger. This sense of community responsibility appears to have diminished, as modern society increasingly prioritizes capturing events for viral content over taking action to help those in distress.

The commentary criticizes this trend, highlighting a growing detachment from the well-being of others. Instead of rushing to assist, many individuals now opt to record incidents on their smartphones, often prioritizing social media engagement over human compassion. This shift in behavior raises important questions about societal values and the responsibility individuals have to one another in times of crisis.

The author calls for a renewed sense of care and responsibility within communities, urging people to prioritize the safety and well-being of others. The violent actions witnessed in this incident serve as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of inaction and the importance of fostering a culture of support and intervention.

As discussions continue surrounding the chaotic street incident, it is clear that the implications extend beyond the immediate violence.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- A border wall is deemed necessary for securing access points into America, beyond just preventing illegal immigration.

Luna County, New Mexico, is on high alert following a recent traffic stop involving an undocumented woman from the Middle East. The incident has raised significant concerns about national security, particularly regarding potential terrorist intentions linked to her presence near critical infrastructure.

The woman was reportedly found to have plans related to a nearby gas pipeline, which is situated in a remote area. This has led to speculation that she may have been scouting the location for future attacks. Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol, quickly intervened to investigate the situation. Fortunately, they found no immediate threats, but the incident has nonetheless sparked a broader discussion about border security and the potential risks posed by undocumented individuals.

The presence of an undocumented Muslim woman near the U.S.-Mexico border is particularly troubling for many officials and community members. A 2015 report by Judicial Watch highlighted the alarming collaboration between Mexican cartels and terrorist organizations, which have been known to smuggle individuals from terror-afflicted nations into the United States. This connection raises serious questions about the effectiveness of current border security measures.

Further compounding these concerns, a 2017 report revealed that Islamic terror groups based in Mexico have crossed the border to scout potential targets within the U.S. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced security protocols at the southern border, as the potential for terrorists to exploit vulnerabilities remains a pressing issue.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call for Congress to approve funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Advocates argue that the wall is essential not only for preventing illegal immigration but also for securing the nation from potential threats posed by terrorists and drug cartels. Many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not solely from Mexico, and there are concerns that some may receive support from the Mexican government, further complicating the issue.

The argument for a border wall is framed around the notion that it could serve as a critical barrier against foreign threats. With the ongoing challenges of illegal immigration and the potential for terrorist infiltration, the need for a comprehensive security strategy at the southern border has never been more apparent. As law enforcement continues to monitor the situation in Luna County and beyond, the conversation surrounding border security remains a vital topic of national interest.",-44.0,-39.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,444.0,-2.2941176470588234,-0.08783783783783784
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a world where the pressures of professional sports often overshadow personal values, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out as a beacon of hope and inspiration. Wilson, known for his impressive skills on the field, emphasizes a profound love for God and a commitment to helping others. His mission transcends the game of football; he aims to serve and change lives, aspiring to leave a legacy filled with joy.

On the field, Wilson is laser-focused on winning games and leading his team to victory. However, his priorities shift dramatically when he steps off the turf. Outside of the stadium, he actively promotes joy and peace, driven by his faith and the importance of making good choices. This duality in his life reflects a deep-seated belief that success is not solely measured by athletic achievements but also by the positive impact one can have on the lives of others.

Despite the NFL's advice to refrain from discussing his faith publicly, Wilson remains steadfast in sharing his message through his actions. He believes that living out his faith is the most powerful testimony he can offer. By prioritizing God first, followed by family and friends, and then football, Wilson asserts that this order leads to positive outcomes in all aspects of life. His approach serves as a reminder that true fulfillment comes from nurturing relationships and staying grounded in one’s beliefs.

Wilson's perspective extends beyond personal values; he critiques individuals in positions of power who seem to forget their roots. He expresses concern over leaders who use their influence for self-glorification rather than for the betterment of society. In a time when corruption and deception appear rampant in leadership, particularly within the current political climate, Wilson’s voice resonates with those who yearn for integrity and authenticity.

The article raises a critical point regarding the perceived double standard surrounding freedom of speech. While many feel free to express a wide range of opinions, discussions about faith often face scrutiny. Wilson’s experience highlights this disparity, as he navigates the complexities of sharing his beliefs in a world that sometimes views such expressions with skepticism. The question arises: when did helping others and standing firm in one’s faith become subjects of criticism?

Wilson’s commitment to standing for truth and righteousness is unwavering. He challenges the notion that faith-based messages should be silenced or marginalized. Instead, he advocates for a culture that embraces the importance of faith and the positive change it can inspire. His actions serve as a call to action for others to reflect on their values and the impact they can have on their communities.

In a society that often prioritizes individual success over collective well-being, Wilson’s approach is refreshing. He embodies the idea that true leadership involves uplifting others and fostering a sense of community. By prioritizing faith and service, he sets an example for both athletes and fans alike, encouraging them to look beyond personal gain and consider the greater good.

As Wilson continues to navigate his career in the NFL, his message remains clear: a life rooted in faith and dedicated to helping others can lead to a legacy of joy. His journey serves as a reminder that, regardless of the challenges faced, the pursuit of truth, righteousness, and service to others can create a lasting impact. In a world that often seems divided, Wilson’s commitment to his values offers a glimmer of hope and a path toward a more compassionate future.",79.0,109.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,662.0,3.892857142857143,0.1646525679758308
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a poignant address to Italy's press, Pope Francis delivered a strong critique of fear-based media, drawing a parallel between sensational journalism and terrorism. The Pope's remarks come at a time when the media landscape is increasingly dominated by narratives that incite fear and anxiety among the public.

During his speech, Pope Francis emphasized the detrimental effects of journalism rooted in gossip and rumors, warning that such practices can inflict harm not only on individuals but also on society as a whole. He underscored the responsibility of journalists to report truthfully and constructively, rather than perpetuating a cycle of fear that can lead to societal discord.

Referencing a famous quote from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Pope highlighted that fear itself poses a significant challenge. This assertion resonates deeply in the current climate, where, despite a decline in crime rates, Americans are reporting heightened levels of fear. Polls indicate that concerns about terrorism and crime have surged, reflecting a growing anxiety that permeates the national consciousness.

The Pope's comments also touch on the broader implications of media influence, particularly the role of outlets like Fox News in shaping public perception. Critics argue that such media platforms often amplify fears, contributing to a distorted view of reality that can exacerbate feelings of insecurity among viewers. This phenomenon has been linked to a rise in fear across the United States, where frequent reports of terrorist attacks and mass shootings have fostered a sense of disorder and vulnerability.

As the Pope addressed these pressing issues, he called for a more responsible approach to journalism—one that prioritizes truth and fosters understanding rather than fear. His remarks serve as a reminder of the power of the media in shaping societal attitudes and the importance of ethical reporting in promoting a more informed and resilient public.

In a world where fear can easily be weaponized, Pope Francis's call for a shift in media practices is both timely and necessary. By advocating for a journalism that seeks to unite rather than divide, the Pope encourages a collective effort to combat the pervasive culture of fear that threatens to undermine social cohesion.

As the media continues to evolve, the challenge remains for journalists to navigate the fine line between reporting on real issues and sensationalizing them for viewership. The Pope's address serves as a clarion call for a more compassionate and responsible media landscape, one that recognizes its profound impact on the lives of individuals and the fabric of society.",-56.0,-33.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,464.0,-2.0625,-0.07112068965517242
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

However, this conclusion is met with skepticism as other snap polls from sources such as TIME Magazine, Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville present a more favorable view of Trump, suggesting he may have won the debate in the eyes of many viewers.

Key topics during the debate included the Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and Trump's tax returns, all of which have been pivotal issues throughout the campaign. The mixed results from various polls raise questions about the validity of CNN's findings, particularly due to its Democrat-leaning sample pool. Despite Clinton's apparent win in CNN's poll, analysts suggest that these results may not significantly influence voter turnout as the election date approaches.

In response to the polling, Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude to his supporters for their favorable responses, while Clinton has yet to comment on the debate or the polling outcomes. Trump's campaign has also been marked by controversy, as he criticized the media for allegedly providing him with a defective microphone during the debate. He further suggested that he should have brought up Bill Clinton's infidelity, indicating a strategy to shift focus onto his opponent's past.

As the election draws near, both candidates are acutely aware of the limited time they have to sway undecided voters. Adding to the tension, Julian Assange has hinted at an ""October surprise"" release on Wikileaks that could potentially impact Clinton's campaign, leaving many to speculate about the implications of such a revelation.

With the stakes higher than ever, the debate results and subsequent polling will likely play a crucial role in shaping the final weeks of the campaign as both candidates strive to solidify their positions ahead of the election.",18.0,-1.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,387.0,-0.08333333333333333,-0.002583979328165375
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

In the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, Hillary Clinton confidently declared victory, yet the reactions from various focus groups and social media suggest a more complex narrative. While Clinton's camp celebrated her performance, the sentiment among viewers appears to be divided.

Focus groups conducted by both Fox News and CNN indicated a favorable outcome for Clinton. CNN's analysis, which included a group of Florida voters, reported an overwhelming 18-2 split in favor of Clinton. Similarly, Fox News, with a focus group from Pennsylvania, showed a 16-6 advantage for the former Secretary of State. These results seemed to bolster Clinton's assertion of victory.

However, not all assessments were as positive for Clinton. Pollster Frank Luntz observed that while Trump struggled with his comments regarding his taxes, he gained traction when addressing the controversy surrounding Clinton's email scandal. This shift in momentum may have contributed to the mixed reactions from the public.

Trump's performance was not without its challenges. He faced significant backlash when he attempted to explain his long-standing questioning of President Obama's birthplace, a topic that has been a point of contention throughout his campaign. Despite these hurdles, an alternative poll emerged, showing Trump with a striking 92% to 8% lead, further complicating the narrative of Clinton's victory.

Following Clinton's declaration of victory on social media, a wave of backlash ensued, with the hashtag #TrumpWon trending globally. This reaction highlights the polarized nature of the electorate and the differing perceptions of the debate's outcome.

Critics have also pointed out Clinton's tendency to avoid media interactions following debates, raising questions about her willingness to engage with the press and the public in the aftermath of such high-stakes events. As the dust settles from the debate, it remains to be seen how these dynamics will influence the upcoming election.",18.0,21.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,361.0,1.3125,0.05817174515235457
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted in Charlotte for the second consecutive night in response to the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, a tragic event that has ignited outrage and calls for justice across the city. The protests, which began peacefully with around 1,000 participants chanting ""Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,"" quickly escalated into chaos when tensions flared following the arrival of riot police.

The situation took a dire turn when a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured during the protests. Initial reports from law enforcement claimed that the shooter was a civilian, but eyewitness accounts have cast doubt on this assertion, suggesting that the shot may have come from law enforcement officers themselves.

Todd Zimmer, an eyewitness to the incident, took to Twitter to express his disbelief at the official narrative, stating, “The city is lying about the incident.” His comments reflect a growing sentiment among protesters and observers who feel that the police are not being transparent about the events that transpired.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, corroborated Zimmer's account, noting that he heard a gunshot that did not sound like a typical firearm. This observation has raised further questions about the circumstances surrounding the shooting and the actions of law enforcement during the protests.

As the night progressed, the atmosphere shifted dramatically. What began as a peaceful demonstration quickly turned into a scene of chaos and confusion. Eyewitnesses described the shooting of the protester as an ""ambush,"" with many indicating that the police were responsible for the violence. This stark contrast between the peaceful intentions of the protesters and the aggressive response from law enforcement has fueled anger and frustration within the community.

In the wake of the shooting, the City of Charlotte swiftly issued a statement claiming that the incident was a result of civilian-on-civilian violence. However, this assertion has been met with skepticism from those who witnessed the events unfold. Additional eyewitnesses, including clergy members, have come forward to refute the police's claims, asserting that it was indeed the police who shot the protester.

Eddie Thomas, a man who was present during the protests, reported seeing a protester bleeding on the ground and receiving no assistance from police. His account highlights a troubling pattern of state violence against African-Americans who are expressing their frustrations and demanding justice.

The protests in Charlotte are not an isolated incident but rather part of a broader movement against systemic racism and police brutality that has been gaining momentum across the United States. The killing of Kenneth L. Scott has become a rallying point for those advocating for change, as they seek to hold law enforcement accountable for their actions.

As the protests continue, the community is left grappling with the aftermath of the violence and the ongoing struggle for justice. The events in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by those who dare to speak out against injustice, and the lengths to which they must go to demand their rights.

The situation remains fluid, with many in the community calling for an independent investigation into the shooting and the actions of law enforcement during the protests. As tensions continue to rise, the eyes of the nation are on Charlotte, where the fight for justice and accountability is far from over.",-74.0,-63.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,627.0,-2.8636363636363638,-0.10047846889952153
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, finds himself under increasing scrutiny for his foreign policy stance, particularly regarding Russia. Critics have raised alarms over what appears to be a troubling alignment with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government, raising questions about the implications for U.S. foreign policy should Trump return to the White House.

Trump's connections to Russia have been a focal point of concern, especially given his history of surrounding himself with individuals linked to the Kremlin. This network has reportedly included support from Russian state media and intelligence services, further complicating the narrative surrounding his foreign policy intentions. While Trump has publicly asserted that he has “ZERO investments in Russia,” an investigation by ABC News has unveiled a different story, revealing numerous ties to Russian interests that amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in business dealings.

The investigation highlights Trump's profitable ventures with Russian oligarchs, who have been known to leverage their wealth for influence. Notably, Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow, a high-profile event that not only showcased his brand but also solidified his connections within Russian elite circles. Additionally, he has engaged in real estate transactions with Russian buyers, a practice that has raised eyebrows among critics who argue that these dealings may serve as a conduit for money laundering.

Russian oligarchs, who amassed their fortunes during the transition to a free-market economy, have been described as materialistic and culturally ignorant by former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev. Their wealth and influence have been instrumental in supporting Putin's regime, and their investment in Trump properties has emerged as a favored method for laundering money out of Russia. This raises significant ethical questions about the potential for conflicts of interest should Trump regain the presidency.

The backdrop of these concerns is the 2014 sanctions imposed by the U.S. State Department on Russian oligarchs, which were intended to curb their influence and financial power. With Trump’s potential return to power, there are fears that he may seek to lift these sanctions, potentially benefiting personally from the very individuals who have supported him financially. This scenario poses a critical question: Can Trump effectively separate his personal financial interests from U.S. foreign policy regarding Russia?

The implications of such a conflict are profound, as they could undermine the integrity of U.S. foreign policy and national security. Critics argue that Trump's financial entanglements with Russian interests could lead to a foreign policy that prioritizes personal gain over the interests of the American people. This concern has prompted calls for Congress to take action, with some advocating for impeachment proceedings against Trump based on these conflicts of interest.

The situation is further complicated by the broader geopolitical landscape, where Russia's actions on the world stage continue to provoke international tensions. As Trump navigates his campaign, the intersection of his business dealings and foreign policy positions will likely remain a contentious issue. The potential for a president with deep financial ties to a foreign adversary raises alarms not only among political opponents but also among national security experts who fear the ramifications of such a relationship.

As the election draws nearer, the narrative surrounding Trump’s connections to Russia is expected to intensify. Voters will be faced with the challenge of discerning the implications of these ties and how they may influence U.S. foreign policy in the future. The stakes are high, and the call for accountability is growing louder as the public demands transparency regarding the potential conflicts of interest that could arise from a Trump presidency.

In conclusion, the scrutiny surrounding Donald Trump’s foreign policy and his connections to Russian interests is a critical issue that cannot be overlooked. As the Republican nominee positions himself for the upcoming election, the questions surrounding his financial dealings and their potential impact on U.S. foreign policy will remain at the forefront of political discourse. The call for Congress to act on these concerns underscores the urgency of addressing the potential conflicts of interest that could shape the future of American diplomacy and national security.",27.0,-3.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,765.0,-0.11538461538461539,-0.00392156862745098
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing the looming threat of impeachment as the fallout from the ""Bridgegate"" scandal continues to unfold. Top state legislators are reportedly considering filing articles of impeachment against Christie if he is found guilty of orchestrating the controversial closure of the George Washington Bridge, an act allegedly intended to punish a political rival.

The scandal, which has been a significant blemish on Christie's political career, has drawn renewed scrutiny following a judge's recent order for the governor to produce personal emails related to the incident. This development has intensified the focus on Christie's involvement in the bridge closure, which resulted in severe traffic jams and even led to one death due to delayed emergency services.

The decision to move forward with impeachment proceedings now rests with Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. If Prieto approves, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would initiate the impeachment process. For the impeachment to proceed, a majority of the 80-member Assembly must vote in favor, while a two-thirds majority in the Senate would be required for a conviction.

Christie's political standing has significantly declined in recent years, particularly as he has been implicated in the ongoing Bridgegate trial involving three of his senior aides. Federal prosecutors have pointed to evidence suggesting that Christie was aware of the scandal's implications, raising questions about his leadership and accountability. Notably, it was revealed that Christie was informed about the bridge closure during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 but failed to take any action at that time.

The governor's political trajectory has shifted dramatically since he endorsed Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump in March 2016. This endorsement marked a pivotal moment in Christie's career, as he was once viewed as a potential leader of the Republican Party. However, the Bridgegate scandal has overshadowed his political achievements and contributed to a significant decline in his public image.

In January 2014, shortly after the scandal broke, Christie held a press conference where he vehemently denied any knowledge of the events surrounding the bridge closure. His assertions, however, have come under increasing scrutiny as more evidence has emerged linking him to the scandal. The ongoing legal challenges and the potential for impeachment have further complicated his role as the chairperson of Trump's transition team, a position that once seemed to bolster his political influence.

As the situation develops, the implications for Christie's future in politics remain uncertain. The potential for impeachment represents a critical juncture not only for the governor but also for the state of New Jersey, as lawmakers grapple with the fallout from the Bridgegate scandal. The outcome of the investigation and any subsequent actions taken by the Assembly will likely shape the political landscape in New Jersey for years to come.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a September 2015 Republican primary debate, Donald Trump made a bold assertion regarding his past interactions with Jeb Bush concerning casino gambling. Trump claimed he never lobbied Bush for casino gambling, stating emphatically that if he had wanted to, he would have succeeded. This statement, however, raises significant questions about the veracity of Trump's claims and the implications of his words, particularly in light of his previous admissions.

In a deposition from 2007, Trump acknowledged that he did indeed push for casino gambling in Florida. This contradiction between his debate assertion and his earlier testimony has led to speculation about potential perjury. The stark difference in Trump's statements suggests a deliberate attempt to mislead the public, possibly to avoid admitting a failure in his dealings with Bush.

During the debate, Jeb Bush accused Trump of attempting to influence him through donations related to casino gambling. Trump, however, vehemently denied this accusation, insisting that he had never lobbied Bush. This denial stands in stark contrast to his earlier admission, raising concerns about a pattern of dishonesty that has characterized Trump's public persona.

The implications of Trump's statements extend beyond mere political posturing. The article draws parallels to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced serious consequences for lying under oath. The comparison raises critical questions about the standards of truthfulness expected from public officials and the potential ramifications of dishonesty in high office.

Trump's tendency to distort the truth is not just a matter of political rhetoric; it poses a tangible danger to national safety. When a leader is willing to manipulate facts for personal gain or to evade accountability, the integrity of the political system is compromised. The potential for misinformation to influence policy decisions and public perception is a serious concern that cannot be overlooked.

To further illustrate the discrepancies in Trump's statements, the article includes transcripts from both the 2015 debate and the 2007 deposition. In the debate, Trump stated, ""I never lobbied Jeb Bush for casino gambling. If I wanted it, I would have gotten it."" In contrast, the deposition reveals a different narrative, where Trump openly discussed his efforts to push for casino gambling in Florida, acknowledging the political landscape and his attempts to navigate it.

This juxtaposition of statements not only highlights Trump's inconsistent narrative but also raises ethical questions about his conduct. If a public figure is willing to lie about their past actions, what does that say about their commitment to transparency and accountability? The article argues that such behavior undermines the trust that is essential for effective governance.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the call for accountability grows louder. The article makes a compelling case for Congress to consider impeachment proceedings against Trump based on his alleged crimes and dishonesty. The precedent set by previous impeachments underscores the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that public officials are held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the discrepancies between Trump's statements during the 2015 debate and his earlier deposition raise serious questions about his integrity and honesty. The potential implications of his alleged dishonesty extend beyond the political arena, posing risks to national safety and the integrity of the democratic process. As the nation grapples with these issues, the call for accountability remains paramount, urging Congress to take action in the face of potential wrongdoing. The truth matters, and it is essential for the health of the nation that public officials are held to the highest standards of honesty and integrity.",-29.0,-16.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,681.0,-0.5517241379310345,-0.023494860499265784
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a drinking game during a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN.

- The Surgeon General cautioned that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related issues following the debate.
- Viewers were advised to drink responsibly during future debates, especially regarding Trump's tendency to lie.","**Surgeon General Warns Against Drinking Games During CNN Debate**

In a striking reminder of the potential dangers associated with drinking games, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a warning ahead of a recent 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN. Many viewers engaged in a drinking game, where participants consumed alcohol every time former President Donald Trump made a false statement. Murthy cautioned that such a practice could lead to serious health risks, including alcohol poisoning.

The Surgeon General's concerns are not unfounded. In 2012, there were approximately 70,000 incidents of alcohol poisoning linked to drinking games during political debates. With the current Republican candidates, Murthy emphasized the need for caution, particularly given Trump's history of making misleading statements. Prior to the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton on September 26, 2016, Murthy had already reiterated his warning about the dangers of drinking whenever Trump lied.

A recent study by Politico highlighted the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, revealing that he told 87 lies over a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, averaging a lie every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Based on this average, it is estimated that Trump likely made around 28 false statements during the CNN debate, raising concerns about the potential for viewers to overindulge in alcohol consumption.

In light of these statistics, Murthy urged viewers to drink responsibly during future debates, particularly in relation to Trump's tendency to mislead. The Surgeon General also noted that first responders were on alert for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate, underscoring the seriousness of the situation.

As political debates continue to draw large audiences, the intersection of entertainment and health remains a critical issue. The Surgeon General's warning serves as a reminder that while engaging in spirited political discussions can be enjoyable, it is essential to prioritize safety and moderation. Viewers are encouraged to consider the implications of their drinking habits during these events, especially in light of the potential for misinformation and the associated risks of excessive alcohol consumption.",-17.0,-20.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,374.0,-1.4285714285714286,-0.053475935828877004
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the aftermath of a recent debate, mainstream media outlets widely declared Hillary Clinton the victor, praising her performance and articulating a clear advantage over her opponent. However, a stark contrast emerged in the realm of social media, where online polls and Twitter trends suggested a different narrative. The hashtag #TrumpWon surged in popularity across the United States, indicating a significant portion of the public felt otherwise.

Interestingly, the hashtag #TrumpWon has its origins traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. This revelation raises concerns about the influence of foreign entities on American political discourse. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has been known to employ cyber-trolls as part of a broader strategy to promote his agenda through disinformation campaigns. These tactics are designed to create discord and amplify divisions among U.S. allies, further complicating the already polarized political landscape.

In addition to the online chatter, Russian state-controlled media has been actively promoting Donald Trump to European audiences, suggesting a concerted effort to sway public opinion in favor of the former president. Analysts believe that Putin's ultimate goal is to manipulate Trump into lifting the economic sanctions that were imposed following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. This manipulation could have far-reaching implications for U.S. foreign policy and international relations.

Reports from ex-bloggers who have worked in this disinformation sphere describe their working conditions as harsh, with strict oversight and penalties for performance. These accounts highlight the organized nature of these campaigns and the lengths to which foreign actors will go to influence American politics.

Given the complexities of online sentiment and the potential for foreign interference, experts caution against placing too much trust in online polls and engaging with accounts that may be linked to Russian trolls. The digital landscape is fraught with misinformation, making it increasingly difficult for the public to discern fact from fiction.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call to action for Congress to consider impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. Advocates argue that the potential for foreign manipulation and the implications of his actions warrant serious scrutiny. As the debate continues, the intersection of media narratives, online sentiment, and foreign influence remains a critical area of concern for the future of American democracy.",-9.0,7.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,418.0,0.4117647058823529,0.01674641148325359
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor. The lawsuit alleges that the company has engaged in systematic discrimination against Asian job applicants during its hiring process, raising significant concerns about the fairness and integrity of its employment practices.

As a contractor for the federal government, including agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA), Palantir is subject to strict regulations regarding hiring practices. The Department of Labor's lawsuit highlights a troubling pattern in the company's recruitment efforts, particularly for engineering intern positions. According to the allegations, out of 130 applicants for these roles, a staggering 73% were Asian. However, the hiring outcomes were starkly disproportionate, with only four Asian candidates being selected compared to 17 non-Asian candidates. This disparity has raised eyebrows, as the likelihood of such an outcome occurring by chance is estimated to be one in a billion, suggesting a potential bias in the hiring process.

The implications of this lawsuit are significant, not only for Palantir but also for the broader conversation about diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. The Department of Labor has emphasized that federal contractors are required to maintain non-discriminatory hiring practices, and any deviation from this standard can lead to serious legal repercussions. The allegations against Palantir could potentially impact its contracts with the federal government, as compliance with anti-discrimination laws is a critical component of maintaining such relationships.

Peter Thiel, who has been a controversial figure in both the tech world and politics, is at the helm of Palantir. A first-generation immigrant, Thiel is known for his support of former President Donald Trump, who has taken a hardline stance against immigration. This juxtaposition raises questions about the values and practices within Palantir, especially in light of the current allegations. Thiel's background as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook has made him a notable figure in Silicon Valley, but his political affiliations and actions have often sparked debate.

Thiel gained further notoriety for his involvement in funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, a case that ultimately led to the company's bankruptcy. His outspoken nature was also on display when he became the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention, where he advocated for individual identity and criticized government incompetence. Despite the positive reception of his speech, the Republican Party subsequently passed an anti-LGBT platform, highlighting a disconnect between Thiel's personal beliefs and the broader party agenda.

In response to the lawsuit, a spokeswoman for Palantir stated that the company intends to defend itself against the allegations of bias. The firm has expressed its commitment to fair hiring practices and has indicated that it will vigorously contest the claims made by the Department of Labor. As the case unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor how Palantir addresses these serious allegations and whether any changes will be implemented in its hiring processes.

The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications not only for Palantir but also for other tech companies that engage with federal contracts. As the industry grapples with issues of diversity and inclusion, the scrutiny on hiring practices is likely to intensify. The Department of Labor's actions serve as a reminder that compliance with non-discrimination laws is not just a legal obligation but also a moral imperative for companies operating in today's diverse society.

As the legal proceedings progress, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how Palantir navigates this challenging situation. The company's reputation, its relationship with the federal government, and the broader implications for the tech industry hang in the balance as the allegations of employment discrimination are examined in the court of public opinion and, ultimately, in a court of law.",-18.0,-20.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,712.0,-0.8,-0.028089887640449437

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Police are actively pursuing leads in connection with the Chelsea bombing that took place last Saturday, injuring 29 individuals. Fortunately, all those injured have since been discharged from the hospital, allowing them to return to their families and communities. However, the investigation into the incident remains a top priority for law enforcement as they work to uncover the motives and identities of those responsible.

In a significant development, a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster located just four blocks away from the site of the initial explosion. This discovery has raised concerns about the potential for further attacks and has prompted investigators to intensify their efforts to ensure public safety.

Three major leads have emerged in the ongoing investigation, each providing critical insights into the possible motivations behind the bombings. The first lead involves a hand-written letter that was found alongside the second bomb. This letter, which is partially written in Arabic, may offer clues about the identity of the bomber or the reasoning behind the attacks. Authorities are currently analyzing the contents of the letter to determine its significance.

The second lead comes from an alarming 911 call made by an unidentified male caller. The caller warned of further explosions, ominously stating, “There will be more.” This threat has heightened fears within the community and has prompted law enforcement to take the warning seriously as they work to prevent any additional incidents.

The third lead is particularly concerning, as it involves a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber.’ This page claims to be the bomber's manifesto, asserting that the author conducted the explosions as a form of protest against societal oppression of the LGBTQ+ community and other inequalities. The post expresses a desire to make a difference and suggests that the bombings were merely tests, with intentions for more serious actions in the future.

The disturbing nature of individuals claiming responsibility for acts of terror raises significant questions about their motives. The assertion that these bombings were intended as a form of protest against societal issues complicates the narrative surrounding the attacks. While the author of the Tumblr post claims to be advocating for change, the violent methods employed raise ethical concerns and challenge the legitimacy of their message.

As the investigation unfolds, law enforcement officials are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. The community's safety is paramount, and authorities are committed to ensuring that those responsible for the bombings are brought to justice. The police are also working closely with federal agencies to analyze the evidence and leads that have emerged thus far.

In the wake of the Chelsea bombing, community leaders are calling for unity and resilience. They emphasize the importance of coming together in the face of adversity and standing against violence in all its forms. The hope is that through collective action and awareness, the community can heal and prevent future acts of terror.

As investigators continue to piece together the puzzle surrounding the Chelsea bombing, the public remains on edge, grappling with the implications of such violence in their neighborhoods. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are determined to uncover the truth behind these troubling events. The coming days will be crucial as they work to decipher the motives of those involved and ensure the safety of the community.",-25.0,-13.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,616.0,-0.52,-0.021103896103896104
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on September 25, 2016

As the presidential campaign intensifies, Donald Trump, at 70 years old, finds himself in a whirlwind of activity, constantly on the campaign trail with little time for rest. With a crucial debate against seasoned politician Hillary Clinton looming, Trump is juggling last-minute rallies while attempting to prepare for what many consider a pivotal moment in his campaign.

However, signs of stress and incoherence have begun to surface in Trump's behavior, raising concerns about his mental state as he approaches the debate. His recent social media activity has drawn particular attention, with a tweet that covers three unrelated topics: a shooting in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina. This tweet has sparked discussions about the candidate's focus and mental clarity, suggesting a wandering mind that may not be fully prepared for the high-stakes confrontation ahead.

Critics argue that the combination of these disparate topics in a single tweet indicates a level of unhinged behavior that could undermine his readiness for the debate. As Trump continues to campaign vigorously, the pressure appears to be mounting, leading to questions about his fitness to engage in a critical discussion with Clinton, who is known for her political acumen and experience.

The implications of Trump's current state could signify a turning point for his campaign. With the debate set to be a defining moment, the ability to present coherent and focused arguments will be essential. Observers are left wondering whether Trump's frenetic schedule and apparent lack of focus will hinder his performance against Clinton, who is expected to come prepared and poised.

As the nation watches closely, the upcoming debate may not only impact the trajectory of Trump's campaign but also shape the perceptions of voters regarding his capability to lead. With the stakes higher than ever, the question remains: can Trump regain his focus and present himself as a viable candidate, or will the signs of stress continue to overshadow his campaign efforts?",-22.0,-3.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,383.0,-0.25,-0.007832898172323759

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio – In a stark contrast to the vibrant rallies of her opponent, Hillary Clinton's door-knocking event held at 1 pm on a recent afternoon attracted an unexpectedly low turnout, raising eyebrows about the effectiveness of her campaign strategy as the election season heats up.

The event, which was anticipated to draw a significant number of volunteers eager to support Clinton's candidacy, ended up being a solitary affair. Only one individual, a supporter of Donald Trump, showed up to document the proceedings. Upon realizing the identity of the lone attendee, Clinton's staff promptly asked him to leave, highlighting the tension that often accompanies political events in a polarized environment.

The absence of enthusiastic supporters at Clinton's event stands in stark contrast to the large crowds that have been a hallmark of Trump rallies. While Trump has consistently drawn thousands of supporters, Clinton's empty turnout raises questions about her campaign's ground game and overall appeal. The lack of volunteers at such a pivotal moment in the campaign suggests potential issues that could hinder her efforts as the election approaches.

Political analysts are beginning to express concerns regarding Clinton's campaign effectiveness. The enthusiasm gap between the two candidates is becoming increasingly apparent, with Trump’s rallies often filled to capacity, showcasing a fervent base ready to rally behind their candidate. In comparison, Clinton's event in Delaware serves as a troubling indicator of her campaign's current state, as it appears to struggle to mobilize supporters.

The implications of this disparity in support could be significant as the election draws nearer. With Trump gaining momentum and enthusiasm among his base, Clinton's campaign may need to reassess its strategies to engage and energize her supporters. The empty chairs at her door-knocking event could symbolize a larger issue within her campaign, one that may ultimately affect her chances in the upcoming election.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the enthusiasm of the electorate will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the race. Clinton's team will need to address these concerns head-on if they hope to compete effectively against a candidate who has demonstrated an ability to galvanize large crowds and maintain a strong presence in the public eye.

In the coming weeks, it will be essential for Clinton's campaign to find ways to connect with voters and inspire a sense of urgency among her supporters. The stark contrast between her event and the vibrant atmosphere of Trump rallies serves as a reminder of the challenges she faces in rallying her base and building momentum as the election approaches.

As the political climate intensifies, the question remains: can Clinton turn the tide and generate the enthusiasm needed to compete effectively against Trump? The outcome of her campaign may hinge on her ability to engage with voters and inspire a renewed sense of commitment among her supporters. With the election looming, the stakes have never been higher, and the need for a robust ground game has never been more critical.",-7.0,45.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,571.0,2.25,0.07880910683012259

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a recent bombing in New York City, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his immediate reactions, which have sparked a wave of controversy and debate. Trump, who accurately described the incident as a ""bombing,"" faced criticism from CNN for his choice of terminology, despite the fact that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used the same description in her own remarks.

CNN's coverage of the event drew scrutiny when it was revealed that the network edited out Clinton's reference to the attack as a bombing. This decision has raised questions about media bias and the integrity of reporting, particularly in the context of a politically charged environment. Trump's response to CNN's actions came during an appearance on the popular morning show, Fox and Friends, where he did not hold back in his criticism of the network.

Calling CNN ""disgusting and disgraceful,"" Trump accused the network of dishonesty for failing to include Clinton's wording in their coverage. He emphasized that his description of the event was not only accurate but also necessary in the context of the ongoing discussions about terrorism and national security. Trump's remarks reflect a broader concern about how media outlets report on sensitive issues, particularly those involving terrorism and public safety.

In addition to his criticism of CNN, Trump took the opportunity to address what he perceives as a failure of leadership in the fight against terrorism. He condemned ""stupid"" leaders for being lenient on the issue, suggesting that a more aggressive approach is needed to combat the threat posed by extremist groups. Trump's comments resonate with a segment of the population that feels that current policies are insufficient to protect American citizens from potential attacks.

The former president also expressed his concerns regarding the influx of refugees into the United States, particularly in light of the ongoing crisis in Syria. He criticized former President Barack Obama's plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees, arguing that such a move poses significant risks to national security. Trump further claimed that Clinton, his political rival, wants to increase that number even more, raising alarms about the implications of such policies.

Trump's argument centers around the inadequacy of the current vetting process for incoming refugees. He has consistently maintained that the system is flawed and that it fails to adequately screen individuals who may pose a threat to the United States. By labeling the leadership as ""stupid,"" Trump is tapping into a narrative that suggests a need for a reevaluation of how the country approaches immigration and refugee resettlement.

The discourse surrounding the bombing and the subsequent reactions from Trump and the media highlights the deep divisions in American society regarding issues of terrorism, immigration, and national security. As the nation grapples with these complex challenges, the responses from political figures and media outlets will continue to shape public perception and policy discussions.

In conclusion, Trump's immediate reaction to the New York City bombing has ignited a firestorm of debate, particularly regarding media coverage and the handling of terrorism and refugee policies. His criticisms of CNN and the current leadership reflect a broader sentiment among those who advocate for tougher measures in the face of growing security concerns. As the situation evolves, it remains to be seen how these discussions will influence the political landscape and the future of U.S. policy on immigration and national security.",-45.0,-36.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,642.0,-1.6363636363636365,-0.056074766355140186

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

In a surprising turn of events, Ahmad Rahami, a convicted terrorist and murderer, has filed a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey, claiming discrimination against his family based on their cultural background. The lawsuit, which has drawn significant attention, alleges a pattern of harassment directed at his family, who have operated a chicken restaurant in the area since 2002.

Rahami's family, originally from Afghanistan, includes Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad. They contend that local officials have subjected them to unjust treatment, including numerous tickets and court summons that they believe are unwarranted. The family claims that their restaurant has been unfairly targeted, particularly for remaining open past 10 PM, despite having the necessary permissions to do so.

The lawsuit further alleges that the Rahami family has faced racial abuse from local residents, including derogatory comments aimed at their Muslim faith. These claims highlight a broader issue of discrimination that the family asserts they have endured since establishing their business in the community.

According to the lawsuit, the police have cited high crime rates in the area as a justification for their actions against the Rahami family. However, the family argues that this rationale is unfounded and that the police have violated their constitutional rights in an attempt to force the restaurant to close earlier than permitted.

The allegations of discrimination and harassment come in stark contrast to Ahmad Rahami's criminal history. Five years after the family began facing these challenges, Ahmad was arrested for planting bombs in New York City, an act that raised serious questions about his motivations and actions. This irony has not gone unnoticed, as it complicates the narrative surrounding the family's claims of discrimination.

The lawsuit has sparked discussions about the treatment of minority-owned businesses and the potential for systemic bias within law enforcement. Advocates for civil rights have expressed concern over the implications of the Rahami family's allegations, emphasizing the need for fair treatment and protection under the law for all citizens, regardless of their cultural background.

As the case unfolds, it remains to be seen how the courts will address the claims made by Ahmad Rahami and his family. The outcome could have significant ramifications not only for the Rahami family but also for the broader community in Elizabeth, as it grapples with issues of race, discrimination, and the role of law enforcement in minority neighborhoods.

The lawsuit serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding cultural identity and the challenges faced by immigrant families in America, particularly in the wake of high-profile criminal cases that can overshadow their experiences. As the legal proceedings progress, the Rahami family's story will likely continue to resonate within discussions about justice and equality in the United States.",-49.0,-42.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,529.0,-2.3333333333333335,-0.07939508506616257
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Allegations of pay-to-play corruption have emerged surrounding Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the foundation's financial practices and its true purpose. In response to these allegations, the Clinton campaign has initially focused on highlighting the foundation's charitable work, attempting to distance itself from the growing scrutiny.

Critics, however, argue that the Clinton Foundation has primarily functioned as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates rather than a genuine charitable organization. This perspective is bolstered by troubling financial data from the foundation's 2014 IRS filings, which reveal a stark contrast between its reported charitable contributions and its overall spending.

In 2014, the Clinton Foundation allocated a mere 5.7% of its budget to charitable grants, a figure that has raised eyebrows among watchdog groups and political opponents alike. The foundation's total expenditures for that year reached nearly $91.3 million, yet less than $5.2 million was directed toward charitable causes. This raises significant concerns about the foundation's priorities and its commitment to philanthropy.

A closer examination of the foundation's financial breakdown reveals that a substantial portion of its budget was devoted to salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, totaling $34.8 million. Additionally, the foundation incurred $50.4 million in ""other expenses,"" further complicating the narrative of a charity focused on altruism. Notably, charitable spending saw a dramatic decrease of 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite the foundation receiving an additional $30 million in revenue.

The increase in salaries and other expenses, which rose by $5 million in 2014, has led to further criticism. Detractors argue that this trend indicates a prioritization of personal financial gain over charitable endeavors. The allegations suggest that Hillary Clinton may have leveraged her position as Secretary of State to benefit financially, casting a shadow over her public service record.

As the controversy continues to unfold, the implications of these allegations are significant. The foundation's financial practices and the Clintons' involvement raise critical questions about the intersection of politics and philanthropy. Critics assert that the foundation has primarily served as a means for the Clintons to generate wealth, challenging the narrative of a charitable organization dedicated to making a positive impact in the world. The ongoing scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation may have lasting repercussions for Hillary Clinton and her political legacy.",25.0,20.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,447.0,1.1764705882352942,0.0447427293064877

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York, former President Barack Obama has left many Americans in shock, drawing sharp criticism for his perceived indifference to recent acts of violence that have shaken the nation. The speech, which took place at a high-dollar fundraiser, has been labeled by some as a display of arrogance and ineffectiveness in the face of pressing national concerns.

Over the weekend, the nation was rocked by a series of violent incidents, including bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing in St. Cloud, Minnesota. These acts of terrorism have left communities on edge and have raised urgent questions about national security and the safety of citizens. However, instead of addressing these grave matters, Obama chose to focus his remarks on issues such as sexism in the media and his support for Hillary Clinton.

Critics have been quick to point out that the former president's decision to prioritize a political fundraiser over addressing the victims of these attacks is both troubling and disappointing. Many feel that elected officials have a responsibility to respond to acts of terrorism with urgency and compassion, yet Obama’s speech seemed to sidestep these critical issues entirely.

The author of a recent article expressed profound disappointment in Obama’s response, arguing that it was not only inappropriate but also indicative of a broader failure among leaders to confront the realities of violence in America. The author described the former president's remarks as ""useless"" and ""arrogant,"" suggesting that they reflect a disconnect from the concerns of ordinary citizens who are grappling with the aftermath of these violent events.

While some defenders of Obama argue that he may not have had sufficient information to comment on the bombings and stabbing, the author contends that a basic acknowledgment of the incidents was warranted. In times of crisis, the public looks to its leaders for guidance and reassurance, and failing to address such significant events can be seen as a dereliction of duty.

The author’s frustration culminated in a strong condemnation of Obama’s approach, labeling it ""disgusting."" This sentiment resonates with many who feel that the former president missed an opportunity to provide comfort and solidarity to those affected by the recent violence. Instead, his focus on political issues and fundraising has left a bitter taste in the mouths of those who expected more from a leader in such tumultuous times.

As the nation continues to grapple with the implications of these attacks, the call for accountability and responsiveness from elected officials remains louder than ever. The expectation is that leaders will prioritize the safety and well-being of their constituents over political ambitions and fundraising efforts. In the wake of violence, the need for compassion and leadership is paramount, and many are left wondering if those in power are truly listening to the concerns of the people they serve.

In conclusion, Obama’s recent speech has ignited a firestorm of criticism, highlighting the tension between political priorities and the urgent need for leaders to address the realities of violence in America. As the nation reflects on the events of the weekend, the hope is that future responses from elected officials will be more attuned to the needs and fears of the public, fostering a sense of unity and resilience in the face of adversity.",-25.0,-53.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,628.0,-2.65,-0.08439490445859872
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

A recent surge in public awareness regarding corruption at the Clinton Foundation has emerged since Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A new report has unveiled serious issues facing the foundation, raising concerns about its operations and practices.

The Daily Caller has reported alarming findings related to the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a prominent arm of the Clinton Foundation. According to the report, CHAI distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa, a practice that a draft congressional report suggests ""likely increased"" risks of morbidity and mortality among patients. This revelation has sparked outrage and could lead to intensified scrutiny of the Clinton charity, particularly as Hillary Clinton gears up for her presidential campaign.

The congressional study also delves into connections between Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-American figures currently under investigation by the FDA and SEC. Notably, the report highlights the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company notorious for its history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the FDA. These associations further complicate the foundation's reputation and raise questions about its commitment to ethical practices.

While the report does not specify how many AIDS patients may have received the compromised drugs, the implications are dire. The potential harm caused by the distribution of diluted medications has prompted calls for immediate action. The report advocates for the shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further damage to public health and trust.

As the situation unfolds, the Clinton Foundation finds itself at a critical juncture, facing mounting pressure from both the public and lawmakers. The implications of these findings could have significant repercussions for Hillary Clinton's political aspirations and the foundation's future operations. The call for accountability and transparency has never been more urgent as the foundation navigates this challenging landscape.",-14.0,-19.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,342.0,-1.3571428571428572,-0.05555555555555555
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for enacting poorly worded laws that have significant implications for parenting activities. A particular law, which criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals, has raised alarm among parents and legal experts alike. Critics argue that this legislation could inadvertently turn parents into felons for engaging in normal, everyday activities such as diaper changes or baths.

The law was ostensibly designed to protect children from molesters, but its vague language fails to account for innocent parental actions that are essential to child-rearing. This oversight has led to widespread concern about the potential consequences for parents who are simply caring for their children.

Adding to the controversy, the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled that defendants accused under this law must prove a lack of sexual intent. This ruling has sparked outrage as it undermines the fundamental presumption of innocence that is a cornerstone of the American legal system. Legal experts argue that this shift places an undue burden on defendants, particularly parents who may find themselves facing serious charges for actions that are not intended to be harmful.

The court's decision has also raised eyebrows due to its suggestion that the public should trust prosecutors to exercise common sense in applying the law. Critics contend that this reliance on prosecutorial discretion is insufficient and that the law itself requires urgent revision to prevent potential misuse.

John Pfaff, a legal expert, has pointed out the troubling implications of plea bargaining in this context. He notes that defendants may feel pressured to accept guilty pleas due to the threat of facing severe charges, even when they are innocent. This coercive environment could lead to wrongful convictions and further erode the rights of parents and caregivers.

The ramifications of this law extend beyond individual cases; it opens the door for potential prosecutorial harassment of parents and caregivers. The fear of being criminalized for routine parenting activities could create a chilling effect, discouraging parents from engaging in necessary care for their children. This situation raises significant concerns about the erosion of constitutional rights for Arizona's families.

Moreover, there are growing worries about due process being suspended for parents and caregivers in Arizona. Without intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court, the legal landscape for parenting in the state may remain precarious, leaving many to navigate a system that seems increasingly hostile to innocent actions.

As the debate continues, advocates for parents' rights are calling for immediate legislative action to amend the law and restore clarity and fairness to the legal framework governing parenting activities. The current situation highlights the urgent need for lawmakers to carefully consider the implications of their legislation, ensuring that laws designed to protect children do not inadvertently criminalize loving and necessary parental care. 

The Arizona state legislature's handling of this issue will be closely watched, as the stakes are high for families across the state. The outcome of this controversy could set a precedent for how similar laws are crafted and enforced in the future, making it imperative that lawmakers act swiftly to address these critical concerns.",-12.0,-35.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,571.0,-1.5909090909090908,-0.06129597197898424
Fake_73-Webpage,Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?,"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts with the possibility of Hillary Clinton assuming the presidency, speculation is rife regarding the future of Michelle Obama. The former First Lady, who has become a prominent figure in American public life, may find herself in a position of influence once again. However, the prospect of covering the Obamas for another four years raises discomfort for some observers, who question the implications of such a scenario.

Critics have begun to scrutinize Michelle Obama’s legacy, particularly her initiatives during her time in the White House. One of the most notable programs she championed was the school lunch initiative, aimed at improving the nutritional quality of meals served to children. While the program garnered support from health advocates, it also faced backlash from parents and students who felt that the changes were impractical and unappetizing. This criticism has led some to question the effectiveness of her efforts and whether they truly addressed the needs of American families.

In addition to her school lunch program, Michelle Obama’s public statements have also come under fire. Detractors argue that her views on health and wellness, while well-intentioned, may not resonate with all segments of the population. This has prompted a broader discussion about her qualifications for a potential role in a Clinton administration. Would her experience as First Lady translate into effective governance, or would it merely serve as a continuation of a legacy that some view as controversial?

Hillary Clinton’s own beliefs about government involvement in child-rearing further complicate the conversation. Clinton has long advocated for a more active role for the government in supporting families and children, a stance that aligns with progressive ideals. This raises concerns among critics who fear that such an approach could lead to increased government control over education and child upbringing. The idea of government dictating how children are raised and educated is a contentious topic, with many viewing it as a dangerous concept that undermines parental authority.

Michelle Obama has made it clear that she intends to continue her campaign for healthy living for children indefinitely. Her commitment to promoting wellness and nutrition is commendable, but it also raises questions about the extent to which government should intervene in personal choices. As she seeks to influence public health policy, the implications of her initiatives on individual freedoms and parental rights cannot be overlooked.

The progressive influence on education and child upbringing is a growing concern for many. Critics argue that an increased government role could stifle creativity and independence in children, leading to a one-size-fits-all approach to education. This perspective highlights the tension between the desire for improved public health and the need to respect the autonomy of families in making decisions for their children.

As the possibility of a Clinton presidency looms, the role of Michelle Obama remains uncertain. While her dedication to health and wellness is admirable, the broader implications of her potential involvement in government raise important questions about the balance between public policy and personal freedom. The discourse surrounding her legacy and qualifications will likely continue to evolve as the political climate shifts, prompting further examination of the role of government in the lives of American families.

In conclusion, the speculation surrounding Michelle Obama’s future in a Clinton administration is fraught with complexities. As discussions about her legacy and qualifications unfold, the concerns about government influence on education and child-rearing will remain at the forefront of public debate. The intersection of health initiatives and personal freedoms will be a critical area of focus as the nation navigates the potential implications of a new political era.",6.0,21.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,671.0,0.7777777777777778,0.03129657228017884

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has emerged involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), raising serious concerns about the distribution of ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This alarming development has drawn attention to the Clinton Foundation's relationship with Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has a troubled history of legal and ethical violations.

The controversy is rooted in a draft congressional report that suggests the distribution of substandard drugs may have significantly increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these medications for their health. The report, initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, highlights the potential consequences of the Clinton Foundation's partnership with Ranbaxy, a company that was found guilty of fraud in 2013 for introducing adulterated drugs into commerce. This legal battle culminated in a staggering $500 million fine for the company, underscoring the severity of its actions.

Dinesh Thakur, a former employee of Ranbaxy, has emerged as a whistleblower in this scandal, bringing to light the company's questionable practices and leading to a significant lawsuit against it. Thakur's revelations have raised critical questions about the integrity of the drugs produced by Ranbaxy and the implications for patients who depend on these treatments.

Rep. Blackburn has been vocal in her concerns, questioning the number of lives that may have been lost due to the distribution of ineffective drugs. She emphasized the potential false promises made to patients, who may have been led to believe they were receiving effective treatment when, in reality, they were not. This situation has sparked outrage among advocates for public health and patient safety, who argue that the distribution of substandard medications is a betrayal of trust.

The Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy has come under intense scrutiny, particularly in light of evidence indicating the company's poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Critics argue that the foundation's continued association with Ranbaxy raises ethical questions about its commitment to patient welfare, especially in vulnerable communities in Africa.

In 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, which resulted in the distribution of over 1.8 million packages of their drugs. Despite the company's generic drugs being banned in the U.S. due to safety concerns, they continue to be sold and distributed globally, raising alarms about the potential risks to patients in regions where access to quality healthcare is already limited.

The implications of this scandal extend beyond the immediate health risks posed to patients. The article suggests a pattern of rampant corruption within the Clinton Foundation, implying that the Clintons may prioritize financial gain over the well-being of individuals, particularly in the African community. This assertion has fueled ongoing debates about the ethical responsibilities of philanthropic organizations and their partnerships with for-profit entities.

As the investigation unfolds, the potential fallout from this scandal could have far-reaching consequences for the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives. The allegations of distributing substandard HIV/AIDS drugs not only threaten the foundation's reputation but also raise critical questions about the accountability of organizations involved in global health efforts.

The draft congressional report serves as a call to action for lawmakers and public health advocates to scrutinize the practices of organizations like the Clinton Foundation and their partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. The health and safety of patients should be the paramount concern, and any evidence of negligence or corruption must be addressed to prevent further harm.

In conclusion, the allegations surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its relationship with Ranbaxy highlight the complexities and challenges of global health initiatives. As the investigation continues, it is imperative that stakeholders prioritize transparency, accountability, and the well-being of patients above all else. The potential consequences of distributing ineffective medications are dire, and the need for rigorous oversight in the pharmaceutical industry has never been more critical.",-63.0,-41.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,725.0,-1.7083333333333333,-0.05655172413793103

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated the State Department to release documents related to Hillary Clinton and her aides' completion of mandatory security training within a five-day timeframe. The decision comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which has been seeking transparency regarding the handling of classified materials by Clinton and her team.

Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, ruled in favor of TheDCNF, rejecting the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. This ruling underscores the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State and the protocols in place for handling sensitive information.

The judge's order requires the State Department to release one-third of the approximately 400 documents requested by TheDCNF by September 26, with the remaining documents due by October 10. This timeline reflects Judge Leon's frustration with the State Department's delays in producing the requested records, which have raised questions about compliance with security training requirements.

Despite the favorable ruling for TheDCNF, Judge Leon denied the organization's request to depose State Department officials. This aspect of the ruling may limit the extent to which TheDCNF can further investigate the circumstances surrounding the alleged failure to complete security training.

The State Department has faced criticism for its handling of the FOIA request, particularly in light of its admission that the absence of produced records suggests that Clinton and her aides did not complete the required security briefings. This revelation has intensified concerns about the protocols followed by high-ranking officials when dealing with classified materials.

TheDCNF's request specifically targets records related to Clinton, her Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The organization aims to clarify whether these key figures received the necessary training to handle classified information appropriately during their time in office.

Attorney Bradley Moss, who has been following the case, noted the judge's evident frustration with the State Department's obstruction of the FOIA process. The ruling highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in government operations, particularly concerning national security matters.

As the deadline for the release of documents approaches, the implications of this ruling could extend beyond the immediate case. The outcome may influence future FOIA requests and the government's obligation to provide timely access to information, especially in cases involving high-profile individuals and sensitive topics.

The ongoing legal battle reflects broader concerns about the handling of classified information within the government and the accountability of officials in positions of power. As the public awaits the release of the ordered documents, the case serves as a reminder of the critical need for oversight and transparency in government operations.

In conclusion, the federal judge's ruling represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing scrutiny of Hillary Clinton and her aides' compliance with security training requirements. With the State Department now under a court order to release the requested documents, the public may soon gain insight into the training protocols followed by Clinton and her team during her tenure as Secretary of State. The outcome of this case could have lasting implications for the handling of classified information and the accountability of government officials in the future.",-5.0,-5.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,607.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.008237232289950576
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the first presidential debate approaches, the role of moderator Lester Holt has come under scrutiny, particularly regarding the absence of fact-checking during the event. Holt will lead the discussion between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but he has confirmed that he will not fact-check the candidates in real-time. This decision raises significant concerns about accountability, especially given Trump's history of making unverified claims.

The lack of on-screen fact-checking is not limited to Holt; major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, have also opted against providing immediate verification of statements made during the debate. This means that while Clinton may respond to Trump's assertions, the responsibility for maintaining honesty and accuracy falls primarily on Holt. Critics argue that this places an undue burden on the moderator, especially in light of Trump's documented tendency to misrepresent facts, reportedly lying every three-and-a-half minutes.

The media's reluctance to engage in fact-checking during the debate is seen as a reflection of broader concerns over ratings and a desire to avoid confrontation with Trump. This approach has sparked debate about the integrity of journalism in the current political climate. Clinton's campaign has highlighted the necessity for the moderator to challenge false statements, arguing that such interventions are crucial for ensuring a fair and balanced debate.

As the debate unfolds, expectations for Clinton are particularly high. Analysts suggest that she must perform exceptionally well to counteract Trump's unchallenged claims, which could resonate with viewers without immediate correction. This dynamic has led to a perception of a double standard in the treatment of the candidates, where Clinton is expected to exceed expectations while Trump may benefit from a lack of scrutiny.

The implications of this debate structure extend beyond the candidates themselves; they raise critical questions about the state of journalism and its role in the electoral process. The absence of fact-checking during such a pivotal event could undermine the public's ability to make informed decisions, as unverified claims may go unchallenged in the moment.

As the nation prepares for this significant political event, the focus remains on how Holt will navigate the complexities of moderation without the support of real-time fact-checking. The outcome of the debate may not only influence the candidates' standings but also reflect the evolving landscape of political discourse and media responsibility in the age of misinformation.",-6.0,0.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,441.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

In a striking revelation, Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has voiced serious concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In her recent statements, Kyle claims that Clinton is driven by ""anger and rage,"" which she believes could lead to a physical breakdown if left unaddressed.

Kyle's assertions extend beyond mere emotional observations; she contends that Clinton is experiencing cognitive impairment that raises questions about her ability to fulfill the demanding role of president. According to Kyle, symptoms such as emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty with tasks are indicative of a deeper issue that could hinder Clinton's effectiveness as a leader.

Moreover, Kyle warns that Clinton's paranoia and controlling nature could culminate in what she describes as a ""psychological disaster."" This alarming perspective sheds light on the potential ramifications of Clinton's mental state, suggesting that her personal struggles could have broader implications for her political ambitions and the Democratic Party as a whole.

In an effort to bring these concerns to light, Kyle authored the book ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" which aims to reveal the truth about Clinton, including her health issues. Through her writing, Kyle seeks to provide a candid examination of Clinton's character and the challenges she faces, both personally and politically.

Kyle's portrayal of Clinton paints a picture of a woman who is ""addicted to power"" and willing to jeopardize her health and the integrity of the Democratic Party in pursuit of her ambitions. This characterization raises critical questions about the motivations driving Clinton's political career and the potential consequences of her actions on the party's future.

The article also notes that Hillary Clinton has faced significant challenges in maintaining a positive public image, particularly in light of ongoing health and character scandals. These issues have cast a shadow over her political aspirations, leading to increased scrutiny from both supporters and critics alike.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Kyle's revelations serve as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding Hillary Clinton's candidacy. With concerns about her mental and physical fitness for the presidency now in the spotlight, the implications for her future in politics remain uncertain. The discourse surrounding Clinton's health and character is likely to persist as the nation approaches the next election cycle, leaving many to ponder the true state of her readiness for leadership.",-13.0,-3.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,459.0,-0.2,-0.006535947712418301

In a world increasingly characterized by migration and cultural exchange, the United States has long been celebrated as a ""nation of immigrants."" However, recent discussions have highlighted a growing sentiment that emphasizes the need for unity and cultural integration among newcomers. This perspective advocates for immigrants to adapt to American customs and traditions, rather than maintaining their own, in order to foster a cohesive national identity.

The conversation surrounding cultural integration has gained traction, particularly in light of statements made by a Quebec mayor regarding the integration of Muslims into Canadian society. The mayor asserted that it is essential for immigrants, particularly those from Muslim backgrounds, to embrace Canadian culture rather than expecting the culture to adapt to them. This assertion reflects a broader belief that while Canada is a nation that prides itself on its acceptance of diverse cultures, the core identity and values of the country should remain intact.

The mayor emphasized that Canadians are not inherently racist or xenophobic; rather, they are open to a variety of cultural expressions. However, he firmly believes that the Canadian identity and culture should not be compromised for the sake of accommodating immigrants. This sentiment resonates with many who argue that the preservation of national identity is crucial in a multicultural society.

In a further assertion of this stance, the mayor stated that religion should remain a private matter and that municipalities have the right to refuse concessions to Islam and Sharia law. This position underscores a growing concern among some citizens that foreign laws and customs could potentially influence local governance and legal systems. The mayor's comments reflect a desire to maintain a clear separation between religious practices and the secular laws that govern Canadian society.

Moreover, the mayor suggested that Muslims who find themselves uncomfortable with Canadian culture should consider returning to Muslim-majority countries. This provocative statement has sparked debate about the responsibilities of immigrants to adapt to their new home. It raises questions about the balance between cultural preservation and the necessity of integration in a diverse society.

In the United States, similar sentiments are echoed, with calls for Americans to reject any foreign laws, including Sharia, from influencing the U.S. legal system. This perspective advocates for a clear delineation between American legal principles and foreign customs, reinforcing the idea that the majority should not be overshadowed by the minority. The argument posits that immigrants should either adopt the local culture or leave, a stance that has garnered both support and criticism.

The discussion surrounding cultural integration is not merely about the acceptance of diverse backgrounds; it is also about the preservation of a shared national identity. Advocates for this viewpoint argue that a cohesive society is built on common values and traditions, which can be diluted if immigrants do not actively engage in the cultural fabric of their new home.

As North America continues to grapple with the complexities of immigration and cultural diversity, the call for unity and integration remains a contentious issue. While the contributions of immigrants are invaluable to the social and economic landscape, the expectation for them to adapt to the prevailing customs and traditions is increasingly seen as a necessary step toward fostering a harmonious society.

In conclusion, the dialogue surrounding cultural integration in both the United States and Canada highlights the delicate balance between embracing diversity and maintaining a cohesive national identity. As the conversation evolves, it will be essential for both immigrants and native citizens to engage in meaningful discussions about the values that bind them together in a shared future.",12.0,20.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,659.0,0.8333333333333334,0.030349013657056147

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

In a striking incident in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through a demonstration. Eyewitnesses initially feared for the man's safety, speculating that he might be the target of a mugging. However, in a surprising turn of events, the protesters allowed him to pass without incident.

The situation was particularly unusual, especially in light of recent reports of rioters stopping and looting vehicles during protests across the country. As tensions often run high in such scenarios, the man's calm demeanor stood out. Instead of panicking, he rolled down his window and displayed a handgun to the crowd. This action prompted a swift response from the protesters, who quickly dispersed, allowing him to continue on his way.

The incident has ignited a debate about the appropriateness of the man's response. Some argue that displaying a firearm in such a tense situation could have escalated the conflict, potentially leading to violence. Others contend that his actions were a necessary measure to ensure his safety in an unpredictable environment.

Critics of the man's decision question whether he should have simply driven through the crowd instead of resorting to showing a weapon. They argue that maintaining composure and avoiding confrontation could have been a more peaceful resolution to the situation. On the other hand, supporters of the man's actions believe that he had every right to protect himself when faced with an unexpected and potentially threatening scenario.

As discussions continue, the incident serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding protests and the varied responses they can elicit. The balance between self-defense and escalation remains a contentious topic, particularly in the context of ongoing social movements. 

While the man was ultimately able to drive away unharmed, the implications of his actions linger, prompting a broader conversation about safety, protest dynamics, and the responsibilities of individuals in such charged environments. As communities grapple with these issues, the incident in North Carolina stands as a notable example of the challenges faced during times of social unrest.",-18.0,-14.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,393.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.035623409669211195

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago's environmentalists are under fire for what critics describe as blatant hypocrisy regarding their support for local development projects. The controversy centers around the contrasting stances taken by these groups on two high-profile initiatives: the proposed George Lucas Museum and the Obama Presidential Center.

In a striking turn of events, environmentalists who previously opposed Lucas's museum, citing concerns over environmental impact, have now expressed enthusiastic support for the Obama Presidential Center, which is set to be built in a public park. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly celebrated the Obama center, raising eyebrows among those who recall the fierce opposition to Lucas's project.

Critics argue that this shift in support reveals a troubling inconsistency in the environmentalists' principles. The Obama center's construction will necessitate the removal of trees and grass, a stark contrast to the Lucas project, which was slated to occupy a parking lot. This apparent contradiction has led to accusations that the environmentalists are willing to compromise their own charter when it suits their interests.

Moreover, some observers have pointed to a racial double standard in the environmentalists' decisions. The support for the Obama center, a project associated with the first Black president, juxtaposed with the rejection of Lucas's museum, has raised questions about the motivations behind these environmentalists' actions.

As the debate continues, the actions of Chicago's environmentalists serve as a reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in balancing community development with environmental stewardship.

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

In a dramatic turn of events, General Stanley McChrystal, the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has resigned following a tense meeting with President Barack Obama. The two leaders have had frequent disagreements regarding the conduct of the war, culminating in a confrontation that many anticipated would mark the end of McChrystal's Army career.

During the Oval Office meeting, President Obama accused McChrystal of failing to support him politically. In a firm response, McChrystal clarified that his duty was to support Obama as Commander-in-Chief, not as a politician. This assertion led to McChrystal submitting his resignation, a move that underscores the deepening rift between military leadership and the Obama administration.

The relationship between Obama and the military has been fraught with tension, with the President reportedly harboring negative sentiments towards military personnel. This backdrop adds weight to the significance of McChrystal's resignation, as it reflects broader issues within the military-political dynamic.

As McChrystal resigned, Obama made a dismissive remark, suggesting he would be happy to disrespect the General after his death. In a display of honor and integrity, McChrystal saluted and responded that he would not stand in line to disrespect anyone, emphasizing his commitment to the values of the military.

This incident not only marks a pivotal moment in McChrystal's career but also raises questions about the future of military leadership under the Obama administration. The implications of this resignation will likely resonate throughout the military and political spheres for years to come.",7.0,-2.0,294.0,0.4666666666666667,0.023809523809523808,284.0,-0.18181818181818182,-0.007042253521126761
Fake_81-Webpage,SURPRISE! 70% Of Charlotte RIOTERS Are Not From There – Guess What That Means… [VIDEO],"SURPRISE! 70% Of Charlotte RIOTERS Are Not From There – Guess What That Means… [VIDEO]

Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has become the epicenter of unrest, with reports indicating that a significant majority of the rioters involved in the recent disturbances were not local residents. At least 70% of those participating in the riots were found to possess out-of-state identification, raising concerns about the nature and intent behind the chaos that unfolded in the city.

The head of the local police union has characterized these individuals as ""professional criminals,"" suggesting that their presence in Charlotte was not coincidental but rather part of a coordinated effort to incite violence and disorder. This assertion aligns with claims circulating in various circles that outside radicals are being strategically deployed to escalate tensions during protests, undermining the peaceful intentions of local demonstrators.

The unrest in Charlotte appears to have been exacerbated by a strong presence of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has been vocal in its opposition to systemic racism and police brutality. The recent events in the city have drawn attention to the broader national conversation surrounding these issues, with many activists asserting that the riots are a manifestation of deep-seated frustrations. However, the involvement of out-of-state rioters has led to questions about the authenticity of the protests and the motivations behind the violence.

In stark contrast to the turmoil in Charlotte, protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have remained largely peaceful. Observers suggest that this difference may be attributed to local sentiment and recent developments in a police shooting case that has garnered significant attention. The community's response in Tulsa reflects a more unified approach to addressing grievances, potentially mitigating the risk of violence that has plagued other cities.

The narrative surrounding the unrest in Charlotte implies that the actions of the rioters are not merely spontaneous reactions to local events but rather part of a larger revolutionary agenda aimed at creating chaos. This perspective raises critical questions about the role of organized groups in shaping the dynamics of protests across the nation. As tensions continue to rise, the implications of these actions could have lasting effects on community relations and the broader movement for social justice.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in contemporary protests, where the lines between peaceful demonstration and violent confrontation can become blurred. The involvement of out-of-state individuals, described as ""professional criminals,"" complicates the narrative and challenges the legitimacy of the protests. As communities grapple with these issues, the need for dialogue and understanding becomes increasingly urgent.

In the wake of the unrest, local leaders and activists are calling for a reassessment of strategies to address the underlying issues that fuel such violence. The focus is shifting towards fostering a more inclusive environment that prioritizes community engagement and constructive dialogue. By addressing the root causes of discontent, there is hope that future protests can remain peaceful and focused on meaningful change.

As the nation watches the developments in Charlotte and other cities, the importance of local voices in shaping the narrative cannot be overstated. The contrast between the violent riots in Charlotte and the peaceful protests in Tulsa highlights the significance of community involvement and the potential for positive outcomes when local sentiments are prioritized.

In conclusion, the unrest in Charlotte, driven by a significant presence of out-of-state rioters, raises critical questions about the motivations behind the violence and the role of organized groups in shaping protest dynamics. As communities across the nation continue to navigate these challenges, the need for unity and understanding remains paramount in the pursuit of justice and equality.",-17.0,-41.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,651.0,-1.7826086956521738,-0.0629800307219662
Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

As the Presidential campaign heats up, Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a significant concern. Claims regarding her serious health issues, including potential neurological diseases, have gained considerable traction among the public and media alike. Following her collapse on September 11th, even her supportive media outlets can no longer overlook the implications of her health status.

Adding to the intrigue, expert Clif Hite has put forth a controversial theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and is now being replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this theory would represent one of the most significant coverups in American political history.

Compounding the situation, reports indicate that Russian intelligence is leveraging video evidence to bolster claims that Clinton is utilizing doubles and has not been seen outside Chelsea's apartment. This narrative has raised eyebrows and fueled speculation about the authenticity of her public appearances.

Additionally, there are allegations surrounding a secret plane crash that purportedly injured Clinton. While some sources were initially skeptical of this report, many have since acknowledged its credibility, further complicating the narrative surrounding her health.

As the campaign progresses, the public is left to ponder the veracity of these claims. Readers are invited to share their opinions: Do you believe Hillary Clinton was injured or killed in a crash and subsequently replaced by CGI?

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC. With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros, do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/exposed-soros-funding-fake-veterans-pac-to-take-trump-down/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soros-trump.jpg,Tiffiny Ruegner,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474871998000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soros-trump.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soros-trump-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/145.thumbnail-144x144.png,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/exposed-soros-funding-fake-veterans-pac-to-take-trump-down/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros.

In a political landscape increasingly influenced by financial backing from high-profile donors, the Common Defense PAC has emerged as a significant force opposing former President Donald Trump. This organization is part of a broader network identified by Discover the Networks, which has pinpointed 187 groups funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, all targeting presidential candidates whose values clash with their own.

Common Defense PAC positions itself as a defender of the rights of all Americans, explicitly stating its opposition to Trump. The organization claims to advocate for the interests of veterans and the broader public, yet its leadership page raises eyebrows due to the absence of contact information for the military veterans listed. This lack of transparency has led to questions about the authenticity of its claims to represent veteran interests.

The PAC has been active in disseminating anti-Trump content across various platforms, collaborating with other organizations that share similar funding sources. Notably, Common Defense PAC promotes the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, a campaign that has garnered support from MoveOn.org, a progressive advocacy group known for its grassroots mobilization efforts.

One of the PAC's notable initiatives was its participation in a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump, which successfully reached over 4.5 million people. This campaign exemplifies the PAC's strategy of leveraging social media to amplify its message and rally support against Trump.

In a related effort, MoveOn.org organized a protest aimed at urging Senator John McCain to disavow Trump, collaborating closely with Common Defense PAC. This partnership highlights the interconnectedness of various left-leaning organizations in their quest to challenge Trump's influence and policies.

Financially, Common Defense PAC's July Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing reveals a striking detail: the organization reported only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This singular source of funding raises questions about the PAC's financial sustainability and its ability to represent a broad coalition of veterans and concerned citizens.

At the helm of Common Defense PAC is Director Perry O’Brien, a left-wing activist and conscientious objector. O’Brien's background includes involvement with Iraq Veterans Against the War, which further emphasizes his anti-war stance. However, critics have pointed out that the PAC's leadership, primarily represented by O’Brien, may not adequately reflect the diverse views and experiences of the veteran community. This has led to skepticism regarding the organization's claims of veteran representation.

O’Brien's activism extends beyond the PAC, as he initiated a MoveOn.org petition against Trump, suggesting a potential link between the PAC's funding and Soros's financial influence. This connection has fueled further scrutiny of the PAC's motives and its alignment with broader progressive agendas.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the role of organizations like Common Defense PAC will likely become increasingly prominent. With substantial backing from Soros and a clear anti-Trump agenda, the PAC is poised to play a significant role in shaping the narrative around Trump and his policies. However, the questions surrounding its leadership, funding, and representation of veterans may continue to challenge its credibility and effectiveness in the political arena.

In conclusion, Common Defense PAC exemplifies the complex interplay of funding, activism, and political strategy in contemporary American politics. As it seeks to mobilize opposition against Trump, the organization must navigate the challenges of transparency and representation to maintain its legitimacy and influence among voters. The coming months will reveal whether Common Defense PAC can effectively leverage its resources and connections to make a meaningful impact in the electoral landscape.",8.0,18.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,667.0,0.72,0.026986506746626688

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has brought to light a controversial decision made by the Obama administration in 2015, which allocated a staggering $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas. This revelation, which initially garnered little media attention, has resurfaced and continues to provoke significant outrage among various segments of the American public.

Critics of the funding argue that it raises serious concerns about U.S. foreign aid, particularly regarding the potential support of Islamic terrorists. Many believe that the allocation of such a substantial amount of taxpayer dollars to refurbish religious buildings abroad is not only misguided but also dangerous. The fear is that this funding could inadvertently bolster groups that may have ties to extremist activities, thereby undermining U.S. national security interests.

Taxpayer advocates have expressed their frustration over what they perceive as reckless spending of money that the U.S. does not possess. They liken the situation to being on a ""gigantic credit card,"" where the government is accruing debt without a clear plan for repayment. This sentiment resonates with many Americans who are currently grappling with economic hardships, as reports indicate that one-third of the workforce is out of work. The allocation of funds for foreign mosque renovations, in the eyes of these advocates, is an egregious misallocation of resources that could be better spent addressing domestic issues.

In defense of the funding, the State Department has stated that the financial support is part of broader efforts to build relationships with Islamic leaders in an attempt to combat extremism. Officials argue that fostering these relationships is crucial for promoting stability and peace in regions where extremism is prevalent. However, this rationale has done little to quell the anger among those who feel that the government should prioritize the needs of its citizens over foreign religious institutions.

The discontent surrounding this funding is further exacerbated by the current economic climate in the United States. With many Americans struggling to make ends meet, the idea of spending taxpayer dollars on refurbishing mosques overseas has struck a nerve. Critics argue that the government should focus on domestic issues, such as job creation and economic recovery, rather than investing in foreign religious buildings.

Moreover, some observers suggest that this funding is indicative of a broader agenda to redistribute wealth to Islamic countries. They contend that such initiatives are part of a strategy to influence U.S. demographics through the resettlement of Muslim refugees. This perspective has fueled fears among certain groups that the government is prioritizing foreign interests over the welfare of American citizens.

As the investigation continues to unfold, the implications of the Obama administration's decision to allocate $770 million for mosque renovations remain a contentious topic. The backlash from taxpayers and critics alike highlights a growing divide in public opinion regarding U.S. foreign aid and its impact on national security. 

In conclusion, the CBS investigation has reignited a debate that many believed had been settled years ago. The allocation of taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas raises critical questions about government spending priorities, national security, and the responsibilities of the U.S. government to its citizens. As the economic struggles persist and public sentiment grows increasingly frustrated, the call for accountability and transparency in government spending is louder than ever. The future of U.S. foreign aid and its alignment with the interests of American taxpayers remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the controversy surrounding this funding is far from over.",-13.0,-30.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,641.0,-1.25,-0.046801872074883

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

In a bold response to the rising threat of terrorism, the United States Marine Corps has unveiled a series of billboards across the nation, aimed at conveying a powerful message of resilience and readiness to confront terrorist groups like ISIS. These groups have long relied on fear and propaganda to intimidate individuals into submission, particularly targeting non-believers whom they label as infidels, often issuing threats of death.

The timing of this campaign is particularly significant, as it comes in the wake of a troubling increase in terrorist attacks within the United States. The Marine Corps seeks to counteract the agenda of these terrorists, which is fundamentally rooted in instilling fear among the populace. By showcasing their unwavering commitment to national defense, the Marines aim to reassure citizens that they are prepared to confront any threats that may arise.

The billboards serve as a visual declaration of the Marines' readiness to fight back against terrorism. They symbolize a collective stance of fearlessness, which the Marines believe undermines the power that terrorists seek to wield through intimidation. In a world where fear can often dictate actions and responses, the Marines are determined to stand firm and challenge the narrative propagated by these extremist groups.

Despite the positive reception from many, the campaign has not been without controversy. Some liberal groups have expressed anger over the billboards, arguing that they may further escalate tensions or contribute to a culture of fear. However, the Marine Corps has made it clear that their priority lies in national defense and the safety of the American people, rather than catering to the opinions of dissenters.

Marines, who have been placed on terrorist hit lists, remain undeterred by these threats. Instead, they welcome the challenge, viewing it as an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to protecting the nation. This fearless attitude is a cornerstone of the Marine Corps ethos, and the billboard campaign is a testament to their resolve.

As the nation grapples with the realities of terrorism, the Marine Corps' message is clear: they are ready and willing to confront those who seek to instill fear and chaos. The billboards not only serve as a reminder of the Marines' dedication but also as a rallying cry for citizens to stand strong in the face of adversity. In a time when fear can easily take hold, the Marines are committed to ensuring that courage prevails.",-53.0,-17.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,452.0,-1.0,-0.03761061946902655

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has been rocked by severe rioting that has left the city grappling with widespread violence and significant damage to local businesses. The unrest has prompted North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency, a move aimed at restoring order and ensuring the safety of residents.

The rioting, which has seen businesses looted and public spaces turned chaotic, has raised serious concerns among city officials and law enforcement. In response to the escalating violence, Governor McCrory has deployed the National Guard to assist local authorities in managing the situation and maintaining peace in the community.

In a bid to deter further unrest, officials have announced stringent measures for those caught participating in rioting, looting, or any form of violence. Individuals found guilty of such actions will face the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This decision underscores the seriousness with which local authorities are treating the disturbances and aims to discourage further illegal activities.

The consequences extend beyond adults, as minor children involved in these activities will also face repercussions. Officials have stated that minors caught engaging in rioting will have their parents affected as well, potentially leading to the loss of state benefits for families. This approach highlights the interconnectedness of family responsibility and community behavior, as officials seek to hold parents accountable for their children's actions.

City official Wilson Stewart has been vocal about the need for parental oversight, emphasizing that parents must closely monitor their children to prevent them from becoming involved in the ongoing unrest. Stewart's comments reflect a growing concern that without proper guidance, young individuals may be drawn into the chaos, further complicating the city's efforts to restore order.

In addition to these measures, a mandatory curfew has been implemented in Charlotte. The curfew is designed to help quell the violence and provide law enforcement with the necessary tools to manage the situation effectively. By limiting movement during certain hours, officials hope to reduce the likelihood of further incidents and allow the community to begin the process of healing.

As Charlotte continues to navigate the aftermath of the riots, the focus remains on restoring peace and ensuring the safety of all residents. The combination of a state of emergency, the deployment of the National Guard, and strict consequences for those involved in the unrest reflects a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges facing the city.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of community stability and the importance of collective responsibility. As officials work to implement these measures, the hope is that the city can emerge from this turmoil stronger and more united, with a renewed commitment to fostering a safe and supportive environment for all its residents.",-33.0,-2.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,515.0,-0.10526315789473684,-0.003883495145631068

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey is under increasing scrutiny and may be facing resignation as criticism mounts over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. The controversy intensified following revelations that Comey granted immunity to several of Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills. Reports indicate that Mills allegedly did not fully cooperate with the investigation, raising questions about the integrity of the inquiry.

The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28, where Comey will be called to account for his actions during the investigation. This hearing comes at a time when the political climate is charged, with many lawmakers demanding answers regarding the FBI's approach to the high-profile case.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has been particularly vocal in his criticism of Comey, calling for his resignation and questioning his fitness for office. DiGenova has characterized the investigation as inadequate, suggesting that it was structured to appear legitimate while ultimately protecting certain individuals involved in the scandal. His comments reflect a growing sentiment among some lawmakers and legal experts who believe that the investigation may not have been conducted with the necessary rigor.

As Congress continues to hold hearings to investigate the handling of the email scandal, Comey is expected to face tough questions about his decisions and the rationale behind granting immunity to key figures in the case. The implications of his actions are significant, not only for the investigation itself but also for Comey's career and reputation as the head of the FBI.

Adding to the pressure, Comey has been issued a subpoena by Congress for failing to provide requested documents related to the investigation. This development underscores the seriousness of the situation and the determination of lawmakers to get to the bottom of the controversy surrounding Clinton's emails.

As the investigation unfolds, questions about Comey's loyalty to Clinton have also emerged. Critics argue that his decisions may have been influenced by political considerations, which could undermine public trust in the FBI's impartiality. The potential fallout from this situation could have lasting effects on Comey's leadership and the agency's credibility.

With the September 28 hearing approaching, all eyes will be on Comey as he prepares to defend his actions and the decisions made during the investigation. The outcome of this inquiry could determine not only his future as FBI Director but also the broader implications for the agency's role in politically sensitive investigations.

As the nation watches, the stakes are high for Comey, who must navigate a complex landscape of political pressure, public scrutiny, and the expectations of Congress. The coming weeks will be critical in shaping the narrative surrounding the Clinton email investigation and Comey's legacy as the head of the FBI.",-17.0,-19.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,515.0,-1.0,-0.036893203883495145

In a shocking revelation, Saudi Arabia, a significant donor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, has been implicated in the horrific practice of selling ISIS sex slaves at public auctions. This alarming connection raises serious ethical questions about the United States' longstanding support for the Kingdom, especially in light of the fact that the majority of the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks were from Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi deputy crown prince has publicly acknowledged that the Kingdom funded 20% of Clinton's campaign, a fact that has drawn scrutiny from various quarters. Critics argue that accepting financial support from nations perceived as adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, undermines the moral integrity of political candidates and their platforms.

Reports have surfaced detailing the trafficking of women, particularly Yazidis and Christians, who are being sold as sex slaves in Saudi Arabia. Eyewitness accounts describe harrowing scenes at auctions where individuals from Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and even Western nations bid on enslaved women. These accounts paint a grim picture of the ongoing human rights abuses that are being perpetuated under the guise of political and economic alliances.

The article calls for an immediate cessation of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, urging politicians to distance themselves from a country that is complicit in such egregious violations of human rights. The ongoing human trafficking and abuse of women by ISIS, coupled with the complicity of various nations, including the United States and Russia, highlight a troubling moral landscape that demands urgent attention.

The author expresses deep concern over the implications of political alliances with countries involved in such atrocities. The moral fabric of a nation is often reflected in its foreign policy decisions, and the United States' support for Saudi Arabia raises significant ethical dilemmas. As the world grapples with the consequences of these alliances, it is imperative for political leaders to reassess their relationships with nations that engage in human trafficking and other forms of systemic abuse.

In light of these revelations, the call for a reevaluation of U.S. foreign policy towards Saudi Arabia has never been more urgent. The implications of continuing to support a regime implicated in such heinous acts are profound, not only for the victims of these crimes but also for the integrity of the United States on the global stage. The moral responsibility to protect human rights must take precedence over political and economic interests.

As the international community watches closely, it is crucial for politicians to take a stand against the atrocities being committed in Saudi Arabia and to advocate for the rights of those who are being victimized. The time has come for a collective effort to end the complicity of nations in human trafficking and to hold accountable those who profit from such inhumane practices.

In conclusion, the troubling ties between Saudi Arabia and U.S. political campaigns underscore the need for a more ethical approach to foreign policy. The ongoing human rights abuses, particularly against women, cannot be ignored, and it is the responsibility of political leaders to ensure that their alliances reflect a commitment to justice and human dignity. The fight against human trafficking and the protection of vulnerable populations must be at the forefront of any political agenda, and it is time for the United States to lead by example in the pursuit of a more just and humane world.",-30.0,-11.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,636.0,-0.55,-0.01729559748427673
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle unfolded with intense exchanges between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump. The event, which was highly anticipated, showcased the stark contrasts between the two candidates as they addressed key issues facing the nation.

NBC moderator Lester Holt found himself at the center of controversy during the debate, facing criticism for his approach to fact-checking Trump. Many observers noted that Holt interrupted Trump multiple times to challenge his statements, with several of these fact-checks later deemed inaccurate. This led to questions about the fairness of Holt's moderation and whether he was applying the same scrutiny to both candidates.

A particularly contentious moment arose when Holt pressed Trump on his alleged support for the Iraq War. Trump vehemently denied having supported the invasion, a claim that Holt insisted was true. However, Holt did not extend the same line of questioning to Clinton regarding her vote in favor of the war, which many viewed as a significant oversight in the debate's structure.

In a post-debate interview, Trump further clarified his stance on the Iraq War, expressing reservations about the invasion and contradicting Holt's assertions. He questioned the decision-making of former President George W. Bush, suggesting that a more cautious approach should have been taken. This revelation added another layer to the debate, highlighting the complexities of Trump's position on foreign policy.

The debate also sparked discussions about the role of the mainstream media in shaping public perception of the candidates. Critics argued that the media's attempts to undermine Trump during the debate were evident, raising concerns about bias in political reporting. Supporters of Trump pointed to his ability to effectively stand up to both Clinton and the media, asserting that he demonstrated resilience in the face of challenging questions and interruptions.

As the debate concluded, it was clear that both candidates had made their marks, but the dynamics of the evening left many viewers questioning the fairness of the discourse. The exchanges between Clinton and Trump not only highlighted their differing visions for America but also underscored the contentious nature of the current political landscape.

With the election approaching, the implications of this debate will likely resonate throughout the campaign, influencing voter perceptions and media narratives. As both candidates prepare for future debates, the scrutiny of their performances and the role of moderators will remain a focal point in the ongoing dialogue surrounding the 2016 presidential race.",-9.0,-9.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,462.0,-0.5,-0.01948051948051948
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The Birther movement, which gained traction during Barack Obama's presidency, has sparked intense debate regarding its implications and whether it reflects a deeper bias against the former president. Central to this discussion are claims about Obama's birthplace, which have been fueled by various articles and documents over the years.

A notable reference comes from a 2004 article published by Breitbart, which controversially stated, ""Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate."" This assertion emerged as Obama was preparing to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his rival, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a scandal. The timing of this article raises questions about the motivations behind such claims, especially as Obama was on the cusp of a significant political milestone.

Interestingly, Obama never publicly refuted the claims made in the Breitbart article, leaving room for speculation about the authenticity of his birthplace. Adding to the intrigue is a 1991 promotional booklet from Obama’s literary agency, which described him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” This booklet was distributed to colleagues in the publishing industry and included a biography that has since been scrutinized for its implications.

The existence of this promotional material has led to further questions about the consistency of Obama's narrative regarding his origins. Critics argue that the description in the booklet contradicts his later assertions of being born in the United States. This inconsistency has fueled speculation about whether Obama may have manipulated his background for personal gain, particularly in relation to educational opportunities.

As the Birther movement gained momentum, it became a focal point for those questioning Obama's legitimacy as a U.S. citizen. The movement's proponents have often pointed to the aforementioned claims and documents as evidence of a broader conspiracy regarding Obama's American birth. This has led to a polarized discourse, with some viewing the movement as a legitimate inquiry into Obama's background, while others see it as a manifestation of racial bias and political animus.

In conclusion, the implications of the Birther movement extend beyond mere questions of birthplace. They touch upon issues of identity, race, and the political landscape of the United States. As the debate continues, the validity of Obama's American birth and citizenship remains a contentious topic, with the claims made over the years serving as a reminder of the complexities surrounding his legacy. The movement not only challenges the narrative of Obama's origins but also reflects the broader societal tensions that persist in American politics today.",-18.0,-3.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,476.0,-0.17647058823529413,-0.0063025210084033615

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

I think we all know why #TrumpWon pic.twitter.com/nwZRxvkX81 — USA For Trump 2016 (@USAforTrump2016) September 27, 2016

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In a recent debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took the stage with an air of confidence that many observers noted was markedly different from her previous performances. Clinton appeared unusually prepared, managing to avoid her characteristic coughs and refraining from reaching for water throughout the event. This composure sparked a wave of discussion among viewers and commentators alike, particularly on social media.

As the debate unfolded, social media users quickly pointed out what appeared to be a flesh-colored device in Clinton's ear. This observation ignited speculation regarding the nature of the device, with some suggesting it could be an earpiece used for receiving assistance during the debate. Theories ranged from the plausible to the absurd, with some users questioning whether the device was merely a trick of light, a fashion accessory, or even a ""Cough prevention machine.""

In response to the swirling rumors, Clinton's campaign swiftly denied the claims regarding the earpiece. They attributed the appearance of the device to reflections caused by the bright television lights used during the broadcast. This explanation, however, did little to quell the speculation, as many continued to dissect the footage and share their theories online.

Adding fuel to the fire, an email from the WikiLeaks archive resurfaced, revealing a discussion between Clinton and her close aide, Huma Abedin, that mentioned an earpiece. This revelation led to further questions about the nature of their conversation and whether it had any bearing on Clinton's debate performance.

Commentator Woods added a humorous twist to the debate surrounding the device, suggesting that Clinton might need assistance to effectively convey her messages. This comment resonated with some viewers, who felt that the former First Lady's polished performance could not be entirely attributed to her own efforts.

Despite the rampant speculation, there remains no concrete evidence to support the claim that Clinton was using an earpiece during the debate. Some observers have posited that the device could simply be a hearing aid or, as Clinton's campaign suggested, a mere reflection of the studio lights. The lack of definitive proof has left the debate open to interpretation, with opinions divided among supporters and critics alike.

As the conversation continues, it is clear that Clinton's debate performance has sparked a renewed interest in her candidacy and the strategies employed by political figures in high-stakes situations. Whether the device in question was an earpiece or not, the incident has highlighted the intense scrutiny that candidates face during public appearances and the lengths to which supporters and detractors will go to analyze every detail.

In the end, the debate served not only as a platform for policy discussion but also as a reminder of the ever-watchful eye of the public and the media, eager to dissect the actions and appearances of those in the political arena. As the election season progresses, it remains to be seen how this incident will impact Clinton's campaign and the broader political landscape.",-5.0,12.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,554.0,0.6,0.021660649819494584
