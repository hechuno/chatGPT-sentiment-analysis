Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Former President Bill Clinton's recent remarks regarding donors to the Clinton Foundation have ignited a firestorm of negative headlines, drawing parallels to accusations made by Donald Trump. The controversy centers around Clinton's acknowledgment that while foundation donors may seek favors, it does not imply that those favors will be granted. This statement has been interpreted by some as a suggestion of a pay-to-play scenario, echoing Trump's long-standing claims about the Clinton Foundation's operations.

In an interview with NPR, Clinton sought to clarify his position, emphasizing that the mere act of asking for favors does not equate to receiving them. This distinction, however, has not quelled the backlash. Critics have seized upon the implications of his comments, framing them within the context of Trump's accusations that the Clinton Foundation operates as a vehicle for political favors. The narrative has been further fueled by leaked emails that suggest some donors to the foundation were granted meetings with Clinton and other officials. While these revelations have raised eyebrows, they have not produced concrete evidence of a pay-to-play arrangement.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump's own charitable foundation has come under intense scrutiny. Reports indicate that Trump has not personally donated to his foundation since 2008, raising questions about his commitment to charitable giving. Furthermore, allegations have surfaced that Trump misused charity funds for personal purchases, including a lavish $20,000 oil painting of himself. These revelations have prompted New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to launch an investigation into Trump's foundation for potential improprieties.

The media landscape surrounding these two figures has become a focal point of discussion, particularly regarding perceived biases in coverage. Media Matters, a progressive research organization, has highlighted what it sees as a double standard in how the media reports on Trump and Clinton. According to their analysis, recent coverage has disproportionately favored minor issues related to Clinton while downplaying significant reports concerning Trump's foundation. This imbalance in media attention has had tangible effects on Clinton's campaign, potentially undermining her efforts to distance herself from the controversies surrounding her foundation.

As the 2024 election cycle approaches, the implications of these controversies are significant. Clinton's comments have provided ammunition for her opponents, who are eager to paint her foundation as a corrupt enterprise. Meanwhile, Trump's own charitable practices are under a microscope, raising questions about his integrity and commitment to philanthropy. The juxtaposition of these two narratives presents a complex landscape for voters, who must navigate the competing claims and counterclaims of both candidates.

The ongoing investigations into Trump's foundation could further complicate his campaign, especially if new evidence of wrongdoing emerges. For Clinton, the challenge lies in reframing the narrative surrounding her foundation and countering the perception of impropriety. As both candidates vie for public support, the interplay between their respective controversies will likely shape the political discourse in the months to come.

In conclusion, Bill Clinton's recent statements about foundation donors have reignited discussions about the ethics of political fundraising and charitable giving. While Clinton seeks to clarify his position, the implications of his comments resonate within a broader narrative of accountability and transparency in politics. As the media continues to scrutinize both Clinton and Trump, the outcomes of these investigations and the public's perception of each candidate will play a crucial role in the upcoming election. The stakes are high, and the political landscape remains as contentious as ever.",6.0,3.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,647.0,0.1111111111111111,0.00463678516228748
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, alleging that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially increasing the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients. The report, titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, and it scrutinizes the implications of CHAI's actions in the context of its mission to aid AIDS victims.

CHAI, widely recognized as one of the Clinton Foundation's most significant initiatives, was established to improve access to HIV/AIDS treatment and care, particularly in developing countries. However, the new report raises serious concerns about the quality of the drugs distributed under its auspices, particularly those sourced from Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, a key distributor for CHAI.

The report delves into the relationship between Bill Clinton and Ranbaxy, which has been under intense scrutiny for its manufacturing practices. Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower and former employee of Ranbaxy, played a pivotal role in exposing the company's questionable practices, which ultimately led to a landmark lawsuit. In 2013, Ranbaxy pleaded guilty to multiple criminal counts related to fraud and the distribution of adulterated drugs, resulting in a hefty $500 million fine. The Department of Justice stated that the diluted drugs posed increased risks to patients, raising alarms about the potential consequences for those relying on these medications.

Rep. Blackburn has expressed deep concern over the implications of CHAI's actions, questioning how many lives may have been lost due to the distribution of substandard drugs. The report highlights the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, despite the company's known quality control issues, and raises critical questions about the oversight and accountability of CHAI in its drug distribution practices.

One of the most troubling aspects of the report is the uncertainty surrounding the number of AIDS patients who may have received compromised drugs. In 2007, ProPublica reported that the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, further complicating the narrative of accountability and responsibility in the distribution of HIV/AIDS medications.

Thakur, in his whistleblower role, emphasized that the effectiveness of anti-retroviral drugs could be severely compromised if the actual content did not match what was indicated on the label. This revelation underscores the potential dangers faced by patients who were prescribed these medications, as they may have been led to believe they were receiving effective treatment when, in fact, they were not.

Ranbaxy's practices did not go unnoticed by regulatory bodies. The World Health Organization scrutinized the company, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning letter regarding its quality control issues. Despite these significant concerns, CHAI continued to distribute Ranbaxy's drugs abroad, raising further questions about the initiative's commitment to patient safety and drug efficacy.

In a striking contradiction, Bill Clinton praised Ranbaxy in 2013, claiming that their drugs had saved millions of lives. This statement stands in stark contrast to the allegations presented in the congressional report, which suggests a troubling disconnect between the foundation's public messaging and the realities of drug quality and patient safety.

Thakur's attempts to engage with CHAI and the Clinton Foundation regarding these issues were met with silence, raising concerns about transparency and accountability within the organization. Although CHAI became a separate entity from the Clinton Foundation in 2010, it maintains close ties with overlapping board members and staff, further complicating the narrative of independence and oversight.

The report also suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards through a 2000 executive order that altered intellectual property policies for HIV/AIDS medicines. This executive order is posited as a potential catalyst for the distribution of generic HIV drugs from multiple foreign manufacturers, including Ranbaxy, beginning in 2003.

As the report unfolds, it highlights potential corruption and the financial benefits that the Clinton Foundation may have reaped from its partnerships with drug manufacturers. Rep. Blackburn has voiced her concerns not only about the health implications for patients but also about the emotional toll on healthcare workers who may have been misled by the false hopes created by the Clinton Foundation's initiatives.

The implications of this report are profound, as it raises critical questions about the integrity of health initiatives aimed at combating one of the most devastating epidemics of our time. The potential distribution of substandard drugs under the auspices of a well-respected foundation calls into question the accountability mechanisms in place for organizations that operate in the complex landscape of global health.

As the congressional investigation continues, the findings of this report may have far-reaching consequences for the Clinton Foundation, CHAI, and the broader landscape of global health initiatives. The need for transparency, accountability, and rigorous quality control in the distribution of life-saving medications has never been more urgent, and the revelations contained within this report serve as a stark reminder of the potential risks faced by vulnerable populations in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn raises significant concerns about the practices of the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its relationship with Ranbaxy. As the investigation unfolds, the implications for public health, patient safety, and the integrity of global health initiatives will be closely scrutinized. The potential impact on the lives of those affected by HIV/AIDS cannot be overstated, and the call for accountability and reform in the distribution of medications is more pressing than ever.",-6.0,4.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1019.0,0.125,0.003925417075564278
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The incident raised immediate concerns about her health and well-being, but what transpired later that day has ignited a wave of speculation and intrigue.

Shortly after her collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her demeanor and appearance. Witnesses described her as looking noticeably different—more energetic and lighter than before. However, it was not just her energy that caught the attention of onlookers; many remarked on a significant alteration in her facial features, particularly her nose. This has led to rampant speculation that she may have undergone rhinoplasty, a cosmetic procedure that reshapes the nose.

The discussion surrounding Clinton's appearance has taken a peculiar turn, with some observers suggesting that what they saw was not the real Hillary Clinton but rather a ""clone."" This theory posits that the ""clone"" possesses a Roman-type nose, contrasting sharply with the real Hillary's Nordic nose. Additionally, the clone appears younger and notably lacks a mole above the right lip that has long been a characteristic feature of the real Hillary Clinton.

As the political landscape heats up, questions arise about the implications of this transformation. With the upcoming debates against Donald Trump on the horizon, speculation is mounting regarding whether the real Hillary will be able to participate. Observers are advised to look for signs of change in her appearance, such as being thinner or younger, which may indicate the presence of the alleged clone.

The ramifications of this situation extend beyond mere appearance. Concerns have been voiced about the possibility of the real Hillary Clinton not being involved in her administration if elected. The notion that her clone could conduct public appearances raises significant questions about the authenticity of leadership in a potential Clinton administration. If Hillary were to win the presidency, it is suggested that her clone might handle all aspects of the inauguration and subsequent administration, leading to an unprecedented scenario in U.S. history.

This situation could result in a unique dynamic where a president serves merely as a figurehead, with the true decision-making power potentially resting elsewhere. The implications of such a development are profound, as it challenges the very foundation of democratic governance and the expectations of the electorate.

While these theories may seem far-fetched to some, they reflect a growing unease among certain segments of the population regarding transparency and authenticity in political leadership. The idea of a ""clone"" raises questions about identity, representation, and the nature of political engagement in the modern era.

As the political climate continues to evolve, the public will undoubtedly be watching closely for any further developments regarding Hillary Clinton's health and appearance. The upcoming debates and campaign events will serve as critical moments for the former Secretary of State, as observers seek to discern the reality behind the speculation.

In conclusion, the events surrounding Hillary Clinton's collapse and subsequent appearance have sparked a whirlwind of theories and concerns. Whether one subscribes to the notion of a ""clone"" or views the situation through a more conventional lens, the implications for the upcoming election and the future of American politics are significant. As the nation prepares for what could be a historic election, the questions surrounding Clinton's health and authenticity will likely remain at the forefront of public discourse.

Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, former President Donald Trump’s controversial statements regarding immigration and terrorism have reignited debates about his suitability for office. His rhetoric has raised alarms among various communities, particularly regarding his views on Muslims and immigrants, which many critics argue could have severe implications for civil rights and national unity.

Trump has made headlines with his inflammatory remarks about immigrants, labeling many as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" This characterization has not only polarized public opinion but has also contributed to a growing atmosphere of fear and mistrust towards immigrant communities. His proposal to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border was framed as a necessary measure to protect American citizens from what he describes as dangerous individuals entering the country.

In addition to his comments on immigration, Trump has suggested the creation of a national registry for Muslims, a proposal that has drawn comparisons to the historical actions taken against Jews in Nazi Germany. This alarming analogy has raised concerns about the potential for discrimination and the erosion of civil liberties under his leadership. Critics argue that such a registry would not only violate constitutional rights but also further alienate a community that already faces significant scrutiny and prejudice.

Trump's approach to combating terrorism has also been marked by extreme rhetoric. He has advocated for measures that many consider inhumane, including the idea of killing the families of terrorists. This stance raises ethical questions about the implications of collective punishment and the potential for further radicalization of individuals who may feel targeted by such policies.

His Senior Communications Advisor has indicated that Trump’s focus is less on addressing the root causes of terrorism and more on countering the narratives put forth by former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This approach suggests a prioritization of political posturing over substantive policy discussions aimed at effectively combating terrorism.

Criticism of the Obama administration has been a recurring theme in Trump’s rhetoric. He has accused the previous administration of allowing immigrants from dangerous countries to gain U.S. citizenship and of increasing the number of Syrian refugees. Trump claims that the threat of radical Islamic terrorism has escalated under the leadership of Obama and Clinton, advocating for a more aggressive stance to eliminate this perceived threat.

However, Trump's accusations extend beyond policy critiques; he has previously suggested that Muslims are not doing enough to report terrorist activities. This assertion raises significant concerns about his views on the Muslim community and the potential for fostering an environment of suspicion and division. The implications of such rhetoric could lead to increased discrimination and a chilling effect on the rights of Muslim Americans.

The recent attacks in New York and New Jersey, which were perpetrated by an American citizen, underscore the complexity of the terrorism issue. These incidents highlight the importance of recognizing that threats can emerge from within the country, challenging the simplistic narrative that often associates terrorism solely with foreign nationals or specific religious groups. The focus on constitutional rights becomes paramount in this context, as it serves as a reminder that all individuals, regardless of their background, are entitled to protection under the law.

As the election draws near, the potential consequences of a Trump presidency loom large. The author warns that his controversial stances on immigration and terrorism could lead to severe repercussions for the nation, including the erosion of civil liberties and the exacerbation of societal divisions. The fear is that a Trump-led administration could institutionalize discrimination and undermine the foundational principles of equality and justice that the country was built upon.

In light of these concerns, there is a pressing call to action for voters. The upcoming election presents an opportunity for citizens to voice their opposition to Trump’s divisive rhetoric and policies. Engaging in the electoral process is crucial for those who believe in upholding the values of inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background.

The stakes are high, and the implications of the election outcome could shape the future of the nation for years to come. Voters are urged to participate actively in the democratic process, ensuring that their voices are heard and that they stand against the normalization of hate and division. The time to act is now, as the future of the country hangs in the balance.

In conclusion, Donald Trump’s controversial statements regarding immigration and terrorism raise significant questions about his approach to governance and the potential consequences for various communities.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, promoting the concept of One World Government and globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

In recent discussions surrounding pay-to-play corruption, the spotlight has turned to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the integrity of the organization and its financial practices. While the Clinton campaign has sought to highlight the foundation's positive contributions to global health and development, critics argue that the foundation primarily functions as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates.

According to IRS filings, the Clinton Foundation's financial allocations paint a troubling picture. In 2014, the foundation's budget totaled nearly $91.3 million, yet only a mere 5.7% of that amount—less than $5.2 million—was directed toward charitable grants. This stark contrast raises concerns about the foundation's commitment to its stated mission of philanthropy.

The financial breakdown reveals that a significant portion of the foundation's budget was spent on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, totaling $34.8 million. Additionally, the foundation allocated $50.4 million to ""other expenses,"" which further complicates the narrative of a charity focused on altruism. Notably, charitable spending saw a dramatic decrease of 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite the foundation receiving an additional $30 million in revenue.

The increase in salaries and other expenses by $5 million in 2014 has led to further scrutiny of the foundation's financial priorities. Critics argue that these expenditures suggest a focus on enriching the Clintons and their associates rather than fulfilling the foundation's charitable objectives.

The author of the analysis concludes that the Clinton Foundation has primarily served as a means for the Clintons to generate wealth. This assertion is bolstered by the claim that Hillary Clinton leveraged her position as Secretary of State to facilitate financial gain for herself and the foundation. The implications of these allegations are significant, as they challenge the integrity of both the foundation and its founders.

As the debate over the Clinton Foundation continues, the juxtaposition of its purported charitable mission against its financial practices raises critical questions about accountability and transparency in philanthropic organizations. The ongoing scrutiny may have lasting implications for the Clintons and their legacy, as the public grapples with the complexities of pay-to-play politics and the ethical responsibilities of those in power.",25.0,15.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,418.0,1.0,0.03588516746411483
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

The incident, which involved Clinton convulsing and being assisted into her van, initially drew an explanation from her campaign attributing it to the heat. However, it was later revealed that the temperature in New York City that day was a mild 74 degrees, raising eyebrows about the official narrative.

Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea's apartment, passing multiple hospitals en route, which further fueled speculation about her health. The Greensboro rally itself has come under scrutiny, with questions about its authenticity surfacing shortly after the event. Observers noted the presence of numerous cameras in the audience, leading to concerns that the rally may have been staged.

Additional analysis from various videos suggested that the audience at the rally was not genuine, prompting further doubts about the event's legitimacy. A C-Span video was referenced to confirm that the original footage had not been altered, adding to the ongoing debate surrounding the rally's authenticity. As Clinton continues her campaign, the implications of these incidents and the surrounding speculation remain a focal point for both supporters and critics alike.",4.0,0.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,237.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the film industry gears up for the release of the fictional movie ""Weekend at Chelsea's,"" anticipation is palpable among audiences eager to see how the narrative will unfold. The film, which centers around the health and media portrayal of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has sparked a wave of discussion regarding her well-being and the media's role in shaping public perception.

Critics have long pointed to what they perceive as the media's unwavering support for Clinton, suggesting that this allegiance may lead to a downplaying of serious health issues. This sentiment has been echoed by various commentators who argue that the media's portrayal of Clinton often glosses over significant concerns regarding her health, instead opting for a more favorable narrative that aligns with their political leanings.

Amidst this backdrop, claims have emerged suggesting that Clinton is severely ill, with detractors dismissing these concerns as mere ""conspiracy theories."" This dismissal has not quelled the speculation surrounding her health, particularly in light of a traveling physician and a so-called ""mystery man"" who has been present during Clinton's medical emergencies since 2003. The presence of these figures has only fueled the fire of speculation, leading many to question the true state of her health.

Speculation has intensified around the possibility that Clinton may be suffering from seizures and potentially Parkinson's disease, with observers pointing to her symptoms and medical history as evidence. These claims have raised alarms among her critics, who argue that such health issues could significantly impact her ability to serve in public office. The notion that Clinton may be grappling with serious health challenges has led to accusations of dishonesty regarding her health, further reinforcing public distrust in her character and fitness for the presidency.

Adding to the complexity of the situation are Clinton's declining poll numbers, which have been exacerbated by her controversial comments about Donald Trump's supporters. These remarks have not only alienated a segment of the electorate but have also contributed to a growing narrative that questions her political viability. As her approval ratings continue to wane, the intersection of her health struggles and political missteps has become a focal point for both supporters and detractors alike.

Moreover, Clinton's statements regarding racism have drawn scrutiny, with critics highlighting perceived hypocrisy in her remarks. Many have linked her comments to her past associations and actions, suggesting that her current stance may not align with her historical behavior. This perceived inconsistency has further complicated her public image, leading to a sense of disillusionment among some of her supporters.

Despite the political disagreements that have characterized her career, there is a palpable sense of mixed feelings regarding Clinton's health struggles. While many may oppose her policies or political ideology, there remains a level of compassion for her personal challenges. The acknowledgment of her health issues has prompted some to hope for her well-being, even as they grapple with their political differences.

As speculation mounts regarding the future of Clinton's political career, there is a growing sentiment that it may be nearing its end. While her supporters may wish for her continued involvement in public life, there is also a recognition that her health struggles could necessitate a retreat from the political arena. The hope for her well-being in private life resonates with many, as they grapple with the complexities of her legacy and the impact of her health on her future endeavors.

In conclusion, the anticipation surrounding ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" serves as a reflection of the broader discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and media portrayal. As the film approaches its release, the conversations it has sparked will likely continue to evolve, shedding light on the intricate relationship between health, politics, and public perception.

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant farewell address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama expressed deep concerns about the ongoing struggle against ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. His remarks underscored a sobering reality: despite the might of U.S. military power, the fight against these groups remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties.

Obama characterized ISIS and similar organizations as a ""JV team,"" a term he previously used to describe their capabilities in comparison to more established threats. This analogy served to highlight the limitations of military intervention in effectively dismantling such groups. He articulated a critical perspective on the efficacy of military force, suggesting that it alone cannot resolve the complex issues at play in regions plagued by extremism.

A significant theme of Obama's address was the recognition that no external power can compel disparate religious or ethnic communities to coexist peacefully. He stressed the importance of honesty in understanding the nature of these conflicts, advocating for a nuanced approach that goes beyond mere military solutions. The former president acknowledged that while military action may be necessary in certain contexts, particularly in dealing with ISIS, the situation in Syria exemplifies a scenario where ultimate military victory is unattainable.

In light of these challenges, Obama called for a renewed commitment to diplomacy, humanitarian aid, and political settlements that honor the dignity and diversity of affected communities. He emphasized that sustainable peace cannot be achieved through force alone; rather, it requires a concerted effort to address the underlying issues that fuel extremism.

However, the address also sparked criticism, particularly directed at liberal perspectives that downplay the connection between radical Islam and violence. The article accompanying Obama's speech argued that such denial has contributed to the current predicament, where the threat of radical Islam looms large. The author contended that ignoring this reality could lead to dire consequences, urging for decisive action against the forces of extremism.

The call for action resonated with those who believe that a proactive stance is essential in countering the rise of radical ideologies. The author posited that inaction could pave the way for a grim reality, where the consequences of neglecting the threat of radical Islam become increasingly severe.

As Obama concluded his address, the weight of his words lingered in the air, a reminder of the complexities surrounding the fight against extremism. His emphasis on diplomacy and the need for a multifaceted approach to conflict resolution serves as a crucial takeaway for global leaders grappling with similar challenges. The former president's candid acknowledgment of the limitations of military power and the necessity for honest dialogue underscores the ongoing struggle to foster peace in a world marked by division and strife.

In the end, Obama's final address to the U.N. Assembly encapsulated a critical moment in the discourse surrounding terrorism and extremism, urging a collective reevaluation of strategies to combat these persistent threats.",-5.0,-7.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,548.0,-0.35,-0.012773722627737226
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have shed light on the connections between the rise of ISIS and actions taken by U.S. intelligence agencies as early as 2012. The revelations suggest that the Obama Administration may have inadvertently created conditions that allowed ISIS to isolate the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad.

According to the documents, there was a clear prediction that support from Western nations, Turkey, and Gulf states for Takfiri militants would lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed has pointed out that the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad's regime, fully aware that such actions could pave the way for the emergence of an Islamic State.

The documents also highlight significant miscalculations made during the Obama Administration, particularly the characterization of ISIS as a ""JV"" team. This underestimation, coupled with the failure to maintain a residual U.S. military presence in Iraq, is viewed as a critical error that contributed to the rise of the terrorist organization.

In addition to insights on ISIS, the declassified documents provide information regarding weapons operations in Libya prior to the 2012 Benghazi attack. U.S. intelligence was reportedly aware of weapons being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports, raising questions about the extent of American involvement in the region's turmoil.

The report suggests that American servicemen and women may have been sacrificed due to a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that prioritized concealment over national security. This revelation has sparked renewed debate over the implications of U.S. foreign policy decisions in the region and their long-term consequences.

As the details of these documents continue to circulate, they underscore the complex interplay between U.S. intelligence operations and the rise of extremist groups in the Middle East, prompting calls for a reevaluation of past strategies and their impact on global security. The findings serve as a stark reminder of the unintended consequences that can arise from foreign intervention and the need for a more transparent approach to national security.",-27.0,-4.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,374.0,-0.3333333333333333,-0.0106951871657754
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The incident raised immediate concerns about her health, prompting a wave of speculation regarding her well-being and future public engagements.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her demeanor. Witnesses described her as appearing noticeably more energetic and lighter than before, leading to questions about the nature of her recovery. However, it was not just her energy that caught the attention of onlookers; her physical appearance seemed to have undergone a significant change as well.

Many observers remarked on what they perceived as a difference in Clinton's nose, with some suggesting that she may have undergone rhinoplasty. This observation has fueled a growing narrative that a ""clone"" of Hillary Clinton has emerged, characterized by a Roman-type nose, in stark contrast to the Nordic nose that has been a hallmark of her appearance. The implications of such a transformation have led to further speculation about the authenticity of the individual seen in public.

Adding to the intrigue, the clone reportedly appears younger and notably lacks a mole above the right lip, a distinguishing feature of the real Hillary Clinton. This discrepancy has led to a flurry of discussions among political analysts and the public alike, with many questioning the identity of the person representing Clinton in recent appearances.

As the political landscape heats up, particularly with the upcoming debates against Donald Trump, observers are left wondering whether the real Hillary Clinton will be able to participate. The potential absence of the former First Lady from critical political events raises concerns about her ability to engage in the electoral process fully. Analysts are advising the public to remain vigilant for signs that may indicate the presence of the real Hillary, such as changes in weight, age, and overall health indicators.

The situation has prompted deeper concerns regarding the implications of Clinton's health and appearance on her potential candidacy. Speculation has arisen about the possibility that if she were to become President, the real Hillary Clinton might not be seen or heard in the public sphere. This has led to theories suggesting that her double could conduct all public appearances and official duties, effectively serving as a stand-in for the former Secretary of State.

The notion that Hillary Clinton could become a figurehead in her administration has sparked discussions about the dynamics of leadership and decision-making. Some analysts propose that significant decisions could be made by her cabinet, with Clinton serving more as a symbolic leader rather than an active participant in governance. This scenario raises questions about the nature of political representation and the authenticity of leadership in contemporary politics.

The current discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and appearance has drawn comparisons to previous speculation regarding former President Barack Obama. Such discussions often delve into the mysteries surrounding leadership and the extent to which public figures may be perceived differently from their true selves. The parallels drawn between these two political figures suggest a broader narrative about the complexities of identity and representation in the political arena.

As the situation continues to unfold, the views expressed in this article reflect the author's perspective and do not necessarily align with the opinions of EagleRising.com. The ongoing speculation surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and appearance serves as a reminder of the intense scrutiny public figures face and the myriad interpretations that can arise from seemingly straightforward events. As the political landscape evolves, the public will undoubtedly remain watchful for any developments regarding Clinton's health and her role in the upcoming electoral process.",8.0,21.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,686.0,0.84,0.030612244897959183
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent rumors surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have sparked concerns about her mental and physical health, with speculation suggesting she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. A video that surfaced recently shows Clinton appearing to lose control of her eye movements, raising alarms among her supporters and critics alike.

In the wake of the video incident, Clinton canceled a scheduled fundraiser in North Carolina, further fueling speculation about her well-being. Research indicates that between September 20 and October 19, Clinton has only one rally planned, with no speaking engagements listed for fundraisers during this period. This stark contrast is evident when compared to former President Donald Trump, who has four rallies scheduled between September 20 and 22, highlighting a significant disparity in campaign activity.

Concerns about Clinton's health have been amplified by reports of an incident where she required Secret Service assistance to navigate two steps. Observers are predicting that her health issues may become increasingly apparent, potentially leading to a public meltdown. Such predictions have prompted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to reportedly explore potential replacements for Clinton, as her viability as a candidate comes into question.

Despite the DNC's historical support for Clinton, dating back four years, the current situation presents challenges. Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure within the party, is viewed as unenthusiastic about running for president, complicating the DNC's efforts to find a suitable alternative should Clinton's health continue to decline.

As speculation mounts regarding Clinton's health, many are questioning how these developments will impact public perception of the Democratic Party. Observers believe that the truth about Clinton's condition will eventually emerge, potentially influencing voter sentiment as the election cycle progresses.

With more developments expected in the coming days, the political landscape remains uncertain. The DNC's next steps will be closely watched as they navigate the complexities of Clinton's candidacy and the implications for the party's future. As the situation unfolds, the focus will remain on Clinton's health and the potential ramifications for the Democratic Party as they prepare for the upcoming election.",-8.0,3.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,399.0,0.2,0.007518796992481203
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the quiet corridors of the White House, a restless Barack Obama found himself grappling with an unusual predicament one late night. The rhythmic, thunderous snoring of his wife, Michelle, echoed through their residence, making sleep an elusive goal. As he tossed and turned, the weight of the world seemed to press down on him, amplifying feelings of sadness and nervousness that had been building over time.

Seeking solace, Obama wandered through the West Wing, the familiar surroundings offering little comfort. It was during this aimless stroll that he stumbled upon a word that would change the course of history: ""ISIS."" The letters struck him with a peculiar resonance, and in a moment of inspiration—or perhaps desperation—he jotted it down on a Post-It note, unaware of the profound implications this simple act would have.

Months later, the scene shifted dramatically as Obama found himself at the vibrant Coachella music festival, surrounded by the pulsating beats of electronic music. The atmosphere was electric, and as he swayed to the rhythm, a radical idea began to take shape in his mind. What if he could harness the energy of the festival and channel it into something far more sinister? The thought of starting an international terrorist organization emerged, and with it, the audacious notion of becoming the first American president to create a group called ISIS.

Initially, when Obama shared his groundbreaking idea with those around him, he was met with skepticism and disbelief. Friends and advisors dismissed his vision as a fleeting whim, a product of the festival's euphoric ambiance. Undeterred, he sought out a confidante who might understand the gravity of his ambition: Hillary Clinton.

In the intimate setting of the White House kitchen during a late-night conversation, Obama revealed a shocking secret to Hillary. He claimed to be a 97-year-old Kenyan man, sent to destroy America from within. The revelation hung in the air, and Hillary's reaction was one of disbelief and confusion. She struggled to process the implications of his statement, particularly when Obama added that their beloved dog, Bo, was actually a supercomputer designed to assist in his nefarious plans.

Despite the absurdity of the moment, the two shared a light-hearted laugh, momentarily breaking the tension that had built around their conversation. However, Obama was resolute; he wanted to discuss his plans for ISIS in earnest. The gravity of his vision loomed large, and he felt compelled to articulate it to someone who could potentially share in his ambitions.

The pair decided to relocate to the serene Rose Garden, where the night sky twinkled with stars, providing a picturesque backdrop for their discussion. As they settled in with drinks and snacks, Obama laid out his vision for the terrorist group. He spoke passionately about the need for a new kind of organization, one that could operate in the shadows and challenge the status quo.

Hillary listened intently, her mind racing with the possibilities. In a moment of inspiration, she proposed a strategic plan: what if they waited until she became president to secretly destroy America together? The idea thrilled Obama, igniting a spark of excitement in their conversation. They envisioned a future where they could work in tandem, leveraging their positions to orchestrate a grand scheme that would reshape the nation.

As the night wore on, the two leaders found themselves enveloped in a sense of understanding and connection. They shared stories, laughter, and dreams under the vast expanse of the starry sky. In that moment, the weight of their ambitions felt lighter, and the bond between them deepened.

The evening concluded with a sense of camaraderie, as they both recognized the absurdity of their plans yet felt invigorated by the shared experience. In the quiet of the Rose Garden, they forged a pact, one that would remain hidden from the world, as they contemplated the future of their unlikely collaboration.

In the days that followed, the Post-It note with the word ""ISIS"" remained tucked away in Obama's pocket, a constant reminder of that fateful night. The idea of creating a terrorist organization had morphed from a fleeting thought into a tangible ambition, one that would require careful planning and execution.

As Obama navigated the complexities of his presidency, he found himself reflecting on the conversations he had shared with Hillary. The blend of humor and seriousness in their discussions had sparked a fire within him, pushing him to consider the implications of his actions on a global scale. The world was changing rapidly, and he felt a growing urgency to act.

Meanwhile, Hillary began to strategize her own path to the presidency, knowing that the time would come when she could put their plans into action. The two leaders maintained a discreet connection, sharing ideas and insights as they prepared for the future. Their bond, forged in the quiet moments of the Rose Garden, became a source of strength as they faced the challenges ahead.

As the months turned into years, the world watched as Obama and Hillary navigated the political landscape, each step bringing them closer to their ultimate goal. The idea of ISIS lingered in the background, a constant reminder of the night when two leaders dared to dream of a different kind of legacy.

In the end, the story of that late-night conversation in the White House kitchen would remain a secret, a hidden chapter in the lives of two influential figures. The laughter, the absurdity, and the shared vision would shape their paths in ways they could never have imagined, leaving an indelible mark on history.

As the stars twinkled above the Rose Garden, Obama and Hillary found solace in their shared ambitions, knowing that together, they could navigate the complexities of power and influence. The world may never know the true origins of ISIS, but the bond between these two leaders would forever be etched in the annals of history, a testament to the power of connection and the pursuit of a shared vision.",-4.0,39.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,1138.0,0.8478260869565217,0.03427065026362039
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the wake of recent attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, former President Donald Trump has made a bold declaration to ""destroy"" terrorism in America. This promise, however, raises significant concerns about its feasibility and the potential consequences for American society. Drawing parallels to George H.W. Bush's infamous ""read my lips…no new taxes"" pledge, which ultimately led to political fallout, Trump's statement may similarly backfire as it lacks a substantive plan to address the complex issue of terrorism.

Critics have pointed out that Trump's vow to eradicate terrorism is devoid of a realistic strategy. Unlike previous administrations that have sought to bolster counter-terrorism efforts through increased funding and comprehensive approaches to combatting online radicalization, Trump's rhetoric appears to be more about political posturing than actionable policy. The absence of a detailed plan raises questions about how he intends to fulfill such a sweeping promise, leaving many to wonder if it is merely a campaign tactic aimed at rallying support from those who are easily swayed by fear.

Moreover, the implications of Trump's approach could lead to troubling consequences for American citizens, particularly within Muslim communities. The potential for increased profiling of Muslims and the infringement of civil rights for those deemed suspects is a significant concern. Under a regime that prioritizes aggressive counter-terrorism measures, the risk of heavy policing and segregation of Muslim communities becomes alarmingly plausible. Such actions could foster an environment of distrust and division, undermining the very fabric of American society that values diversity and inclusion.

The language used by Trump in his promise to ""destroy"" terrorism has also drawn scrutiny for its alarming resemblance to fascist rhetoric. The use of hyperbolic terms and aggressive posturing can incite fear and division, creating an atmosphere where marginalized communities are further alienated. This type of rhetoric not only threatens the rights of individuals but also poses a danger to the democratic principles that underpin the nation.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, it is essential to critically assess the implications of Trump's statements and the potential consequences of his proposed policies. The promise to eliminate terrorism is not only unrealistic but also serves as a tactic to garner votes from those who may be motivated by fear rather than informed decision-making. In a time when the nation faces complex challenges, it is crucial for leaders to offer thoughtful, comprehensive solutions rather than simplistic promises that may ultimately lead to greater societal harm.

In conclusion, Trump's vow to ""destroy"" terrorism in America is fraught with challenges and risks. The lack of a concrete plan, combined with the potential for civil rights violations and the fostering of division within communities, raises serious questions about the viability of such a promise. As the nation grapples with the realities of terrorism and its implications, it is imperative to approach the issue with a nuanced understanding rather than succumbing to fear-driven rhetoric. The stakes are high, and the path forward must prioritize the protection of all citizens while addressing the root causes of extremism in a manner that upholds the values of justice and equality.",-28.0,-26.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,586.0,-1.2380952380952381,-0.04436860068259386
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

In a stark warning, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has highlighted a precarious tipping point in global security, citing the escalating threats posed by terrorism and hostilities from nations such as the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno's remarks underscore a critical concern regarding the current state of military readiness, indicating that the Army is only capable of addressing immediate needs. He cautioned that any further reductions in military capacity could lead to severe consequences for national and allied security.

The general pointed to a significant disconnect between the current administration and military leadership, attributing this gap to the Obama Administration's historical disregard for military advice and strategies. This rift, he argues, has played a role in the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa, as military insights were overlooked in favor of political agendas.

Odierno did not shy away from criticizing the administration, labeling its approach as marked by incompetence and arrogance, which he claims has adversely affected the careers of military personnel. He described the current geopolitical landscape as a strategic inflection point, with determined adversaries increasingly threatening the security of the United States and its allies.

The Army has already seen a significant reduction in its active force, with a decrease of 80,000 soldiers and the reorganization of its structure, which included the elimination of 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. This downsizing has raised alarms about the Army's ability to respond effectively to emerging threats.

Moreover, Odierno noted a troubling decline in investment for modernization efforts, which has dropped by 25%. This reduction has had a direct impact on critical military programs, including the modernization of infantry fighting vehicles and the development of scout helicopters. As the Army navigates these challenges, the need for a cohesive strategy that aligns military readiness with national security objectives has never been more urgent.",-4.0,-18.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,359.0,-1.5,-0.05013927576601671

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the November 8, 2016 election approaches, the political landscape in the United States is charged with tension and urgency. Every state has its own laws governing election methods and procedures, yet concerns about the integrity of these elections have reached a fever pitch. The National Democratic Party stands accused of attempting to manipulate the electoral process through various illegal means, raising alarms among those who prioritize free and fair elections.

The author of this piece, identifying as a Christian and Constitutional Conservative, expresses a deep-seated belief that the Democratic Party is not merely a political entity but a force aiming to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States. This assertion is rooted in a series of allegations that have surfaced over the years, particularly surrounding the contentious 2016 presidential election. Claims of voter fraud and ballot stuffing have been levied against the Democratic Party, with specific accusations that these tactics were employed to secure a win for Hillary Clinton.

Central to the argument is the assertion that elections must be free, fair, and honest. The author emphasizes the necessity of proper voter registration and the implementation of photo ID laws to ensure that only eligible individuals participate in the electoral process. However, the Democratic Party is accused of opposing these voter ID laws, a stance that the author interprets as an attempt to allow ineligible individuals to cast their votes, thereby undermining the integrity of the election.

The narrative extends beyond the Democratic Party to include the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system, all of which are accused of suppressing efforts aimed at ensuring fair elections. This perceived collusion raises significant concerns among those who value the principles of democracy and the rule of law. The author argues that such suppression not only threatens the electoral process but also the very foundation of the republic.

In light of these allegations, the author calls upon citizens to take an active role in safeguarding the electoral process. There is a strong appeal for individuals to volunteer as monitors at polling places during the upcoming election. This grassroots initiative is framed as a necessary measure to prevent voter fraud and ensure that the elections reflect the true will of the people.

The article also presents a favorable view of Donald Trump, portraying him as a champion of the cause to save the country from what the author describes as tyranny. Trump's commitment to restoring integrity to the electoral process is highlighted, positioning him as a key figure in the fight against the alleged corruption and manipulation attributed to the Democratic Party.

As the election date draws near, the author underscores the critical nature of the November 8, 2016 election. It is framed as a pivotal moment for the nation, one that could determine the future trajectory of the republic.

Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the annals of American political advertising, few images are as haunting and memorable as the 1964 campaign ad featuring a young girl picking daisies while a mushroom cloud ominously looms in the background. This ad, approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was a masterstroke of political messaging, designed to portray his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a warmonger. The stark contrast between innocence and the threat of nuclear annihilation resonated deeply with voters, effectively swaying public opinion in favor of Johnson, despite the complexities of his own Vietnam policies.

As we navigate the current political landscape, one cannot help but wonder what a modern version of this iconic ad might look like, particularly in the context of Hillary Clinton's campaign. The suggestion of a ""Daisy"" remake targeting Clinton's perceived failures could serve as a potent tool, potentially damaging her campaign in a way that echoes the original's impact. The idea of revisiting such a powerful narrative underscores the desperation that may be felt among Clinton's staff as they grapple with the challenges of the current electoral climate.

Rumors of a new ""Daisy"" ad aimed at Donald Trump have surfaced, further illustrating the high stakes of the upcoming election. This speculation hints at a sense of urgency within Clinton's camp, as they seek to counteract the formidable presence of Trump on the campaign trail. The notion of resurrecting a classic political ad speaks to the lengths to which candidates will go to shape public perception and rally support.

However, the current political discourse is complicated by the pervasive influence of biased media coverage. Voters today find themselves navigating a landscape where information is often filtered through a lens of partisanship, particularly in the case of figures like Ted Cruz. Recent political shifts by Cruz have raised eyebrows, yet the media's selective reporting on his past comments about Trump has left many voters struggling to discern the truth. This selective coverage not only skews public perception but also raises questions about the integrity of journalism in the modern age.

The tendency of journalism to bury critical details is a troubling trend that reflects the short attention spans of the American public. In an era where sound bites and headlines dominate, the nuances of political discourse often get lost in the shuffle. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the coverage of candidates like Clinton, who have faced a barrage of scrutiny throughout their careers. The label of a ""liberal press"" has emerged, suggesting a perceived bias against Democratic and liberal figures, further complicating the media landscape.

As the upcoming debate approaches, the specter of past moderating mistakes looms large. The memory of Candy Crowley's handling of a pivotal moment in a previous debate serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by moderators in maintaining fairness and objectivity. The stakes are high, and the potential for missteps could have lasting implications for the candidates involved.

In the context of Clinton's campaign, it is essential to acknowledge the criticisms she has faced from prominent figures, including Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. These critiques, often overlooked in current discussions, highlight the complexities of her political journey and the challenges she must navigate as she seeks to secure her place in history. The weight of these past criticisms adds another layer of complexity to her campaign, as voters weigh her qualifications against the backdrop of her political history.

In light of these considerations, the call for a new daisy ad that documents Clinton's shortcomings becomes increasingly relevant. Such an ad could serve as a powerful reminder of the challenges she faces and the stakes of the upcoming election. By drawing parallels to the original ""Daisy"" ad, a modern iteration could resonate with voters in a way that transcends traditional political messaging.

Ultimately, the landscape of political advertising continues to evolve, shaped by the unique challenges and opportunities presented by each election cycle. As candidates like Clinton and Trump vie for the hearts and minds of voters, the lessons of the past remain ever relevant. The haunting imagery of the original ""Daisy"" ad serves as a reminder of the power of political messaging and the importance of holding candidates accountable for their actions and decisions.

In conclusion, as we reflect on the legacy of the 1964 political ad and its implications for today's political climate, the need for a new narrative becomes clear. A modern daisy ad that highlights Clinton's shortcomings could prove to be more impactful than the original, serving as a stark reminder of the stakes involved in the upcoming election. As voters grapple with the complexities of the current political landscape, the call for transparency and accountability remains paramount. The power of political advertising endures, and its ability to shape public perception is as relevant today as it was nearly six decades ago.",-18.0,18.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,909.0,0.5454545454545454,0.019801980198019802

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

In a heated political climate, Democrats have been accused of employing intimidation tactics in response to ongoing questions regarding President Obama's birth certificate. Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, has labeled these inquiries as inherently racist. However, critics argue that this assertion is a non-sequitur, contending that questioning the validity of a document does not equate to racism.

Several points have been raised that cast doubt on the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate. Evidence suggests that the document may have been altered, raising questions about its legitimacy. Additionally, it has been noted that Obama's social security number was issued in Connecticut, a state where he has no record of residing. Compounding these concerns, the hospital listed on the birth certificate reportedly did not exist at the time the document was supposedly issued. Furthermore, the birth certificate contains errors that some believe indicate possible falsification.

The article emphasizes the absence of an original birth certificate and criticizes the reliance on accusations of racism rather than addressing the substantive issues at hand. It also highlights that former President Donald Trump has fallen victim to these intimidation tactics, further complicating the discourse.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual, in May 2016.

In May 2016, a brutal homophobic attack on 26-year-old Aaron Woods has raised concerns about the safety of the LGBTQ+ community in the area. Woods was approached by a man who unleashed a torrent of homophobic slurs before physically assaulting him, resulting in a broken jaw. The attack, which has shocked many, underscores the ongoing violence faced by individuals based on their sexual orientation.

Witnesses to the incident reported that the assailant shouted ""Muslim stuff"" during the attack, adding a layer of complexity to the already troubling situation. This incident is not isolated; earlier in the same month, a gay couple was also targeted in a similar attack, highlighting a disturbing trend of violence against the gay community.

Woods' friend described him as a gentle person, emphasizing the severity of the attack, which involved the use of a knuckleduster. The brutality of the assault has left many in the community feeling vulnerable and fearful. Sussex police have confirmed that prompt arrests were made in both cases, and they reported that the victims are currently recovering from their injuries.

The incidents have sparked a broader conversation about the acceptance of the gay community in the context of differing cultural and religious beliefs. The article draws attention to the contrasting views on homosexuality, particularly referencing Islamic teachings and Shariah law, which traditionally condemns homosexual acts. This juxtaposition raises questions about the coexistence of radical Islam and the gay community, as exemplified by Woods' harrowing experience.

As society grapples with these complex issues, the need for dialogue and understanding becomes increasingly important. The attacks on Woods and others serve as a stark reminder of the challenges that still exist for LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly in environments where cultural and religious beliefs clash. 

The community is left to ponder how to foster acceptance and safety for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. As the investigation continues and the victims recover, the hope remains that such acts of violence will not define the relationship between different communities, but rather serve as a catalyst for change and greater understanding.",-26.0,-34.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,394.0,-2.2666666666666666,-0.08629441624365482
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On Saturday night, a shocking incident unfolded at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, when a man dressed in a security uniform launched a violent attack on shoppers, leaving nine people injured. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" during the attack. Eyewitnesses recounted a scene of chaos as Adan moved through the mall, asking at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing them.

The St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly identified Adan as the attacker, and in a troubling development, ISIS later claimed him as one of their own. This incident has raised alarm bells, particularly in light of other recent violent occurrences, including a bomb at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and a meat cleaver attack on police officers in New York.

In the aftermath of the attack, community members expressed their support for Adan's family, describing him as a good man and an accomplished student. This sentiment highlights the complexity of the situation, as many in the community grapple with the actions of one individual against the backdrop of their collective identity.

The situation escalated when off-duty police officer Jason Falconer intervened during the attack. In a decisive moment, Falconer fatally shot Adan after he lunged at him, effectively ending the violent spree. The officer's quick response likely prevented further injuries and chaos within the mall.

The attack has reignited discussions about the Somali refugee population in Minnesota, which has seen significant relocation efforts. Reports indicate that the Obama administration relocated nearly 10,000 Somali refugees to the state, raising concerns about the potential for recruitment by terror groups such as ISIS and Al-Shabaab. This fear is not unfounded, as there have been numerous convictions among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans for collaboration with Islamist groups.

Al-Shabaab, a militant group based in Somalia, has previously issued warnings about attacks on shopping malls, including the Mall of America, which is located just a short distance from St. Cloud. The threat of violence has loomed large over the community, with reports suggesting that Somali refugees in Minnesota have threatened local women, further complicating the narrative surrounding the refugee population.

The Department of Homeland Security has noted a significant relocation of Somali refugees during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. This has led to concerns about the potential increase in Muslim refugee admissions under a Clinton administration, with critics claiming that such policies could lead to more terror attacks on American soil.

As the community processes the trauma of the attack, political discussions have emerged, with some urging voters to reject Hillary Clinton in favor of Donald Trump. Advocates for this position argue that a change in leadership is necessary to ensure safety from terrorism and to address the concerns surrounding refugee admissions.

The St. Cloud mall attack serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by communities grappling with the complexities of immigration, security, and identity. As the investigation continues and the community seeks to heal, the broader implications of this incident will likely resonate far beyond the borders of Minnesota. The interplay between local experiences and national policies remains a critical conversation as the nation navigates the complexities of safety, security, and the integration of diverse populations. 

In the wake of the attack, community leaders are calling for unity and understanding, emphasizing the need to distinguish between the actions of an individual and the values of a community. The Somali-American community in St. Cloud has long been a vibrant part of the local fabric, contributing to the economy and culture of the area. As they confront the aftermath of this tragic event, the hope is that dialogue and cooperation can prevail over fear and division.

The St. Cloud mall attack has not only left a mark on the local community but has also sparked a national conversation about the implications of immigration policies and the ongoing threat of terrorism. As the nation reflects on this incident, the importance of fostering understanding and addressing the root causes of violence remains paramount. The path forward will require a collective effort to ensure that safety and security are prioritized while also honoring the contributions of diverse communities across the country. 

In conclusion, the St. Cloud mall attack is a tragic event that underscores the complexities of modern society, where issues of immigration, security, and community identity intersect. As the community seeks to heal and move forward, the lessons learned from this incident will be crucial in shaping future policies and fostering a more inclusive society. The call for vigilance and understanding is more important than ever as the nation grapples with the realities of a changing world.",-72.0,-49.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,876.0,-1.2564102564102564,-0.05593607305936073
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, the term ""victimhood"" has taken on a new meaning, particularly among younger generations. Millennials, often referred to as the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" have been criticized for fostering a culture where standards for victimhood appear to be declining. This phenomenon is exemplified in the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the New Jersey and New York City bombings, who previously claimed to be a victim of ""Islamophobia.""

Rahami, along with his father, filed a lawsuit against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department, alleging discrimination based on their Muslim faith. The lawsuit, initiated in 2011, claimed that the Rahami family faced unfair treatment and ""selective enforcement"" concerning their chicken restaurant, First American. The family contended that local residents subjected them to racial abuse, with statements such as ""Muslims don’t belong here"" highlighting the hostility they faced.

The allegations made by the Rahami family painted a picture of a community rife with discrimination and bias. However, Mayor Christian Bollwage firmly denied these claims, attributing the complaints against the Rahami family to issues related to noise and street congregation rather than any form of religious discrimination. This response underscores the complexities surrounding claims of victimhood, particularly when they intersect with community concerns and law enforcement practices.

Despite the Rahami family's grievances, their lawsuit ultimately proved unsuccessful. This outcome raises questions about the effectiveness of legal recourse in addressing perceived injustices and the broader implications of victimhood in society. The case serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by individuals who feel marginalized, as well as the skepticism that often accompanies claims of discrimination.

The narrative surrounding victimhood has evolved, with many arguing that it has become a tool for individuals to garner sympathy or justify their actions. In Rahami's case, his claims of victimhood did not prevent him from engaging in violent acts that would ultimately lead to his arrest and charges related to the bombings. This juxtaposition of victimhood and criminality invites a critical examination of how society perceives and responds to claims of discrimination.

As the discourse around victimhood continues to develop, it is essential to consider the implications of labeling individuals as victims. The Rahami case illustrates the potential pitfalls of a culture that may prioritize victim status over accountability. In a world where the lines between victim and perpetrator can blur, the need for a nuanced understanding of these dynamics has never been more pressing.

In conclusion, the Rahami family's experience highlights the complexities of victimhood in contemporary society. As discussions around discrimination and bias evolve, it is crucial to approach these issues with a critical eye, recognizing the potential for both genuine grievances and the misuse of victim status. The case serves as a reminder that while the pursuit of justice is vital, it must be balanced with accountability and a commitment to truth.",-38.0,-42.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,553.0,-2.0,-0.0759493670886076
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to move businesses if employees don't vote in their favor.

In a climate where corporate influence on political outcomes is increasingly scrutinized, the tactics employed by some employers to sway employee voting decisions have come under fire. Historically, employers have threatened to relocate their businesses if employees do not vote in favor of their interests, a practice that raises ethical questions about the intersection of corporate power and democratic processes.

One prominent figure in this ongoing debate is Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Puzder has made headlines for his explicit threats regarding the potential for increased automation in his restaurants should a Democrat win the upcoming election. His comments resonate with those made by former CEO ""Papa"" John Schnatter during the last presidential election, highlighting a pattern of corporate leaders using fear tactics to influence employee voting behavior.

Puzder's plans for automation include the implementation of systems like Eatsa, which significantly reduces human interaction in the dining experience. This shift towards automation is not merely a response to technological advancements but also a strategic move to mitigate labor costs. Puzder argues that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses, suggesting that the benefits of higher wages for some workers may come at the expense of others losing their jobs altogether. This perspective raises critical questions about the broader implications of wage increases and the potential for a growing divide between corporate profits and employee welfare.

With approximately 20,000 employees under his leadership, Puzder's influence extends far beyond the boardroom. His public statements and blog, where he discusses politics and capitalism, suggest a concerted effort to sway his employees' political views. However, it remains uncertain whether his employees share his perspectives or feel the same pressure to align their voting choices with his corporate interests.

Despite Puzder's significant earnings—reportedly nearly $4.5 million in 2012—and the rising profits of his companies, the benefits of this financial success do not appear to trickle down to his employees. This disparity raises concerns about the ethical responsibilities of employers towards their workforce, particularly in an environment where corporate leaders wield considerable power over political outcomes.

The implications of Puzder's threats and the broader trend of corporate influence on voting are profound. Employees may find themselves caught in a dilemma, torn between their personal beliefs and the pressure exerted by their employers. The fear of job loss or reduced hours can create an environment where workers feel compelled to vote against their own interests, perpetuating a cycle of stagnant wages and outsourcing.

As the election approaches, the conversation surrounding corporate influence on voting is likely to intensify. Puzder's commitment to pursuing automation, regardless of the election outcome, underscores a growing trend among employers to prioritize profits over employee welfare. This shift not only impacts the immediate workforce but also raises questions about the future of labor in an increasingly automated economy.

In conclusion, the tactics employed by employers like Andy Puzder highlight a troubling intersection of corporate power and democratic processes. As employees navigate the pressures of voting in a climate of fear and uncertainty, the need for greater transparency and ethical considerations in corporate practices becomes increasingly apparent.

The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a significant development in the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, the FBI has announced that it is examining new evidence that could have serious implications for both Clinton and her close aide, Huma Abedin. This evidence emerged during a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Abedin, and has raised questions about the integrity of the previous investigations into Clinton's email practices.

The investigation into Weiner, who has faced legal troubles of his own, led authorities to a laptop that he shared with Abedin. Reports indicate that this laptop may contain ""tens of thousands of emails"" from Abedin, including emails that were forwarded from Clinton's account. Notably, these emails were not submitted to the FBI during its earlier inquiries, raising concerns about the completeness of the information provided to investigators.

The implications of this new evidence are profound. If the emails found on the laptop are determined to be work-related or classified, both Clinton and Abedin could potentially face charges for lying to the FBI. This development comes at a critical time, as the FBI's letter regarding the investigation was released just 11 days before the presidential election, underscoring the seriousness of the findings and their potential impact on the electoral process.

The backdrop to this investigation dates back to July 2016, when FBI Director James Comey publicly outlined the evidence against Clinton but ultimately did not recommend charges. This decision led to significant discontent among FBI officials, many of whom felt that the investigation had not been pursued with the rigor it warranted. A high-ranking FBI official later revealed that there was a strong desire among agents to revoke Clinton's security clearance and pursue prosecution.

Further complicating matters, an FBI summary disclosed that a State Department official allegedly pressured the FBI to declassify certain information in exchange for additional agents at diplomatic posts. This revelation has raised questions about the relationship between the State Department and the FBI, as well as the potential influence of political considerations on the investigation.

Additionally, the summary mentioned a group of State Department officials referred to as ""The Shadow Government,"" who were reportedly involved in discussions about Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests related to Clinton's emails. This group’s activities have sparked concerns about transparency and accountability within the government.

The investigation has also revealed troubling details about Clinton's handling of sensitive information. Reports indicate that Clinton ignored security advice that could have endangered her and her staff, all for the sake of a photo opportunity. This disregard for security protocols has raised alarms about her judgment and decision-making during her tenure as Secretary of State.

Adding to the controversy, a Clinton supporter reportedly donated nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official involved in the investigation. This financial connection has led to accusations of potential conflicts of interest and has fueled speculation about the motivations behind the FBI's actions.

Central to the investigation is Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was identified as having deleted over 33,000 emails from Clinton's private server. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department, a move that has drawn criticism from various quarters. Critics argue that granting immunity to individuals involved in the deletion of potentially incriminating evidence undermines the integrity of the investigation.

Leaked emails have further complicated Clinton's narrative regarding her private server. Evidence suggests that Clinton communicated with President Obama via her private email account, contradicting her previous claims that the President was unaware of her use of a private server. This revelation has raised questions about the extent of knowledge and involvement of senior officials in the use of the private email system.

Moreover, the investigation has uncovered evidence indicating that Clinton deleted emails after being subpoenaed, suggesting a possible intent to obstruct justice. This timeline of events, which includes key dates related to the investigation and the deletion of emails, highlights potential collusion between the White House and the Clinton campaign to protect her candidacy from scrutiny.

As the investigation unfolds, the implications for Clinton, Abedin, and the broader political landscape remain uncertain. The FBI's renewed focus on this matter has reignited debates about accountability, transparency, and the rule of law in the context of high-profile political figures. With the election looming, the stakes have never been higher, and the outcome of this investigation could have far-reaching consequences for all involved. 

In conclusion, the FBI's investigation into new evidence related to Hillary Clinton's private email server is a developing story that continues to capture national attention. As more information comes to light, the implications for Clinton, Abedin, and the integrity of the electoral process will be closely scrutinized. The intersection of politics, law enforcement, and national security remains a contentious and critical issue in contemporary American society.",-6.0,-4.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,905.0,-0.11764705882352941,-0.004419889502762431
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, known for her strong advocacy of accepting Syrian refugees, has recently faced significant backlash over her open borders policy. This approach, which aimed to provide sanctuary to those fleeing conflict, has resulted in a notable increase in crime across German cities. Reports indicate that thousands of sexual assaults and violent crimes have been linked to the surge in migration, leading to growing concerns among the public.

The ramifications of this policy were evident in the recent elections, where Merkel's conservative Democrat party suffered a substantial defeat. The electorate's discontent with the handling of the migrant crisis has prompted a reevaluation of Merkel's stance. In a candid acknowledgment of her administration's missteps, Merkel stated that the crisis could have been avoided and described multiculturalism as a “living lie.” 

During her party's annual conference, Merkel reiterated her previous slogan, “we can do this,” but tempered her optimism with a stark warning. She admitted that Germany could only manage the situation effectively by controlling the influx of migrants. This shift in tone reflects a growing recognition of the challenges posed by high levels of migration, which she cautioned could overwhelm the country's state and society.

In response to the escalating situation, Merkel announced plans to reduce the number of refugees entering Germany. However, she resisted calls to establish a specific limit on arrivals, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced approach. Merkel highlighted the importance of a coordinated strategy at the German, European, and global levels to regulate and limit migration effectively.

The unfolding situation in Germany serves as a cautionary tale for other nations, including the United States. As countries grapple with the complexities of immigration and integration, Merkel's experience underscores the potential consequences of unregulated migration policies. The challenges faced by Germany may resonate with American policymakers as they navigate their own immigration debates, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and strategic planning in addressing these pressing issues.",-2.0,-6.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,381.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.015748031496062992
Fake_36-Webpage,"DISGUSTING! Because Of Hillary & Obama, NY Terrorist Will Get Better Treatment Than US Vets! ⋆ Freedom Daily","8.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology.

In a striking revelation, a terrorist responsible for planting explosives in New Jersey and New York City is set to receive superior medical care compared to U.S. veterans. This situation has ignited a wave of criticism, particularly from former President Donald Trump, who highlighted the stark contrast during a recent campaign speech.

The individual in question, Ahmad Rahami, will have access to top-tier medical professionals, modern hospital facilities, and comprehensive legal representation as he faces the consequences of his actions. Trump pointedly contrasted this with the ongoing struggles of veterans who have served the nation, many of whom have faced significant barriers in accessing timely and adequate healthcare.

The issue of veterans' care has been a longstanding concern, particularly following a scandal that erupted in 2014 involving the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Reports surfaced detailing long waiting lists and cover-ups of inefficiencies that left many veterans without the care they desperately needed. The fallout from this scandal has been devastating, with over 300,000 veterans reportedly dying while waiting for VA care. The situation has been further exacerbated by the alarming rates of veteran suicides, some occurring in VA parking lots, highlighting the urgent need for reform in the system.

The frustration surrounding this disparity in care is palpable. Many Americans are left questioning the priorities of the government when a terrorist can receive better medical treatment than those who have fought for the country. The author of this article expresses deep concern over the government's failure to provide adequate care for returning veterans, emphasizing that these individuals deserve the best possible support after their sacrifices.

Moreover, the moral dilemma faced by doctors treating Rahami cannot be overlooked. Medical professionals are bound by ethical obligations to provide care to all individuals, regardless of their actions. However, the juxtaposition of this care against the backdrop of veterans' struggles raises profound questions about the values and priorities of the healthcare system.

As the nation grapples with these issues, the disparity in medical care between a convicted terrorist and U.S. veterans serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that persist within the healthcare system. The call for reform and better support for veterans has never been more urgent, as the sacrifices made by these individuals should not be overshadowed by the treatment afforded to those who seek to harm the very fabric of society. The conversation surrounding this issue is likely to continue, as citizens demand accountability and change in the way veterans are treated in the United States.",13.0,-3.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,473.0,-0.17647058823529413,-0.006342494714587738
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more.

In a dramatic incident that unfolded in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, intervened to stop an ISIS terrorist who had stabbed eight people. Falconer’s swift action not only saved lives but also highlighted the critical role of responsible gun ownership and training in public safety. However, this heroism has drawn the ire of political figures, particularly Hillary Clinton, who has expressed intentions to undermine Falconer’s business if elected president.

Falconer is the owner of Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., a company dedicated to promoting gun safety and the rights enshrined in the Second Amendment. His business focuses on providing training for law-abiding citizens who wish to carry concealed firearms for self-defense. This training is essential in empowering individuals to protect themselves and others in dangerous situations, a principle that Falconer has championed throughout his career.

Clinton’s opposition to Falconer’s business is rooted in her broader views on firearms and gun training. She has been vocal about her desire to implement stricter gun control measures, which she argues are necessary to reduce gun violence. However, critics contend that her stance poses a significant threat to the Second Amendment and the rights of responsible gun owners like Falconer.

One of the key legislative measures that Clinton seeks to eliminate is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). This act provides limited legal protection to businesses like Falconer’s against frivolous lawsuits that could arise from the use of firearms. By seeking to dismantle PLCAA, Clinton’s proposals could expose Falconer’s business to a barrage of legal challenges, potentially jeopardizing its operations and the livelihoods of those who rely on it for training.

Falconer has dedicated his life to protecting citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and now through his firearms training company. His commitment to public safety and responsible gun ownership stands in stark contrast to Clinton’s proposed policies, which many believe would hinder the ability of citizens to defend themselves effectively. Critics argue that her approach could lead to a chilling effect on gun training and ownership, ultimately leaving law-abiding citizens vulnerable.

In her campaign, Clinton has faced accusations of misrepresenting the implications of PLCAA. She has been accused of falsely claiming that the act provides ""immunity"" to gunmakers and dealers, a characterization that has drawn scrutiny from various stakeholders in the firearms community. This narrative has fueled concerns among gun rights advocates who fear that Clinton’s policies could further erode the rights of responsible gun owners.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Clinton’s stance on gun rights remain a contentious issue. For Falconer and others in the firearms training industry, the potential elimination of PLCAA represents not just a legal challenge but a fundamental threat to the principles of self-defense and personal responsibility that underpin their work.

In conclusion, the incident in St. Cloud serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of responsible gun ownership and training. Jason Falconer’s actions exemplify the critical role that trained individuals can play in safeguarding their communities. However, as political figures like Hillary Clinton seek to reshape the landscape of gun rights, the future of businesses like Falconer’s hangs in the balance, raising vital questions about the protection of the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves.",-11.0,-3.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,644.0,-0.11538461538461539,-0.004658385093167702
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election heats up, the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has emerged as a pivotal topic, influencing voter perceptions and poll standings. Recent data indicates that concerns surrounding Clinton's health are not only prevalent but are also significantly impacting her campaign.

A recent poll reveals that over 40% of registered voters now view Clinton's health as ""below average"" or ""very poor,"" a notable increase from just 26% in late August. This shift in perception underscores a growing unease among the electorate regarding her fitness for office. In contrast, the percentage of voters who consider Clinton's health to be ""average"" has remained steady at 28%, suggesting that while some voters maintain a neutral stance, a significant portion has shifted towards a more negative view.

The narrative surrounding Clinton's health is further complicated by the rising perception of her opponent, Donald Trump. His health is now viewed as ""above average"" or ""excellent"" by 36% of voters, up from 33%. This contrast in health perceptions may be contributing to the dynamics of the race, as voters often consider a candidate's vitality and stamina when making their electoral choices.

Awareness of Clinton's potential medical issues is widespread, with nearly 80% of respondents acknowledging concerns about her health. At 68 years old, Clinton is perceived to look older than her age, which has raised additional alarms among voters. Speculation about her health has intensified, fueled by reports that she is taking Coumadin, a medication typically prescribed for blood clotting issues, and has been researching Provigil, a drug associated with serious medical conditions.

Public observations of Clinton have also contributed to the growing concerns. Many have noted instances where she appeared confused, required naps, or exhibited physical difficulties, such as needing assistance to navigate stairs. These observations have not gone unnoticed, and they have sparked discussions about her overall well-being and capability to handle the rigors of a presidential campaign.

The scrutiny of Clinton's health has been amplified by various incidents captured on video and in images, including a fainting episode at the 9/11 Memorial. Reports suggest that these videos and images are being systematically removed from the internet, raising questions about transparency and the campaign's efforts to manage public perception. There is a prevailing belief that Clinton's campaign is intentionally limiting her public appearances to avoid drawing attention to her health issues, a strategy that may be backfiring as speculation continues to swirl.

Adding to the public's concern is Clinton's frequent coughing during speeches, which has garnered significant attention. This persistent issue has led to further speculation about her health, with many voters questioning her ability to perform the duties of the presidency effectively.

As the election approaches, the implications of these health-related perceptions could be profound. Voter confidence in a candidate's health is often intertwined with their overall electability, and Clinton's campaign may need to address these concerns head-on to mitigate any potential fallout. The stark contrast in health perceptions between Clinton and Trump could play a crucial role in shaping the electoral landscape, as voters weigh their options in the upcoming election.

In summary, Hillary Clinton's health has become a focal point in the current presidential election, with a significant portion of the electorate expressing concerns about her well-being. As the campaign progresses, how Clinton and her team respond to these health-related issues may ultimately influence voter sentiment and the outcome of the election. With the stakes higher than ever, the narrative surrounding her health will likely remain a critical element of the political discourse in the weeks to come.",-11.0,20.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,693.0,0.8,0.02886002886002886

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle, a former high school sweetheart of Bill Clinton, has unveiled a controversial tell-all book titled ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which offers a scathing portrayal of both Bill and Hillary Clinton. The book delves into Hillary's alleged aggressive demeanor towards individuals she considers beneath her, painting a picture of a woman who harbors a sense of superiority.

In her memoir, Kyle shares personal anecdotes that shed light on the couple's attitudes and behaviors during their time in Arkansas. One particularly striking incident recounted in the book involves Hillary making derogatory remarks about developmentally challenged children during an Easter egg hunt at the governor's mansion. This incident serves as a focal point for Kyle's argument that Hillary often looked down on the residents of Arkansas, whom she reportedly viewed as ""ignorant hillbillies.""

Kyle's narrative suggests that Hillary's upbringing in a middle-class suburb of Illinois contributed to her perceived sense of superiority. While she is depicted as having a dismissive attitude towards the people of Arkansas, the book notes a shift in her demeanor when she campaigned in New York, where she appeared more relatable to voters.

The Clintons' dissatisfaction with their life in Arkansas is also a theme in Kyle's book. It is suggested that their growing weariness of the state played a role in Bill Clinton's decision to forgo running for reelection in 1990, as he set his sights on a presidential bid.

""Hillary: The Other Woman"" promises to stir controversy and reignite discussions about the Clintons' legacy, as Kyle's revelations challenge the public's perception of the couple and their time in Arkansas. As the book gains attention, it remains to be seen how it will impact the Clintons' public image moving forward.",-10.0,-4.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,341.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.011730205278592375

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking ruling, a Massachusetts judge has established a special law that permits black males to flee from police officers without facing legal repercussions. This decision, which is now in effect and cannot be appealed, has sparked significant debate regarding its implications for public safety and law enforcement practices.

The judge's ruling stems from concerns about the fear that some black Americans experience in encounters with police officers. This fear, the judge argues, often leads to a tendency among individuals to flee when approached by law enforcement. The new law allows those who feel ""disproportionately"" targeted by police to run without the risk of being penalized, fundamentally altering the dynamics of police interactions.

Historically, fleeing from a police officer could establish ""reasonable suspicion,"" allowing law enforcement to detain and investigate individuals. However, the new ruling undermines this principle, effectively preventing police officers from pursuing or penalizing individuals who choose to flee. Critics of the decision argue that this change could hinder the ability of law enforcement to protect and serve the community effectively.

The ruling has raised alarms among various stakeholders, with many expressing skepticism about its potential consequences. Detractors suggest that the law may inadvertently benefit individuals with criminal intent, as it provides a legal avenue for evading police scrutiny. The implications of this ruling could lead to increased challenges for law enforcement agencies, who may find themselves unable to act on reasonable suspicion in situations where individuals flee.

Public safety advocates are particularly concerned about the potential for increased danger to citizens as a result of this ruling. The ability of police to pursue suspects is a critical component of maintaining order and ensuring community safety. By allowing individuals to flee without consequence, the ruling may embolden those who wish to evade law enforcement, potentially leading to a rise in criminal activity.

As the law takes effect, the community is left grappling with the balance between addressing concerns about racial profiling and ensuring the safety of all citizens. The ruling has ignited a broader conversation about the relationship between law enforcement and marginalized communities, highlighting the complexities of policing in a diverse society.

In the wake of this decision, it remains to be seen how law enforcement agencies will adapt their strategies and practices. The ruling presents a unique challenge, as officers must navigate the new legal landscape while continuing to fulfill their duty to protect the public. As discussions continue, the community watches closely, aware that the implications of this ruling will resonate far beyond the courtroom.",-13.0,-10.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,484.0,-0.5263157894736842,-0.02066115702479339
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

In his remarks, Sansaricq criticized the response to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, asserting that corruption overshadowed the essential aid that was needed during that crisis.

Sansaricq highlighted that despite billions of dollars flowing into the Clinton Foundation, the Haitian populace continues to endure significant hardships. He accused the Clintons of exploiting the disaster for personal gain, alleging that they misappropriated billions intended for the Haitian people. He pointed out the stark contrast between the Clintons' growing wealth and the ongoing plight of many Haitians, who are still living in tents years after the earthquake.

Calling for greater transparency regarding the funds allocated for aid, Sansaricq questioned the reasons behind the failure to deliver necessary assistance. His statements resonate with themes presented in Peter Schweizer’s book ""Clinton Cash,"" which scrutinizes the financial dealings of the Clintons.

At a recent Trump rally, Sansaricq recounted an incident where he claimed President Bill Clinton attempted to bribe him, which he alleges led to the revocation of his visa after he refused.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed that she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance to revisit the past. This revelation comes in the wake of the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) disappointing performance in the recent elections in Berlin, which has been interpreted as a reflection of the growing anti-migrant sentiment across Germany.

Merkel's comments signal a potential shift in her approach to refugee policy, as she acknowledged her unpreparedness for the 2015 refugee crisis, a pivotal moment that shaped her leadership and the political landscape in Germany. Taking responsibility for the CDU's poor election results, she recognized that the party's stance on migration has become a contentious issue, contributing to the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has capitalized on public discontent regarding immigration.

Despite her regrets about the past, Merkel has firmly dismissed the notion of implementing significant changes to her existing policy framework. She rejected calls from the Christian Social Union (CSU) for a cap on the number of migrants allowed into the country, as well as proposals to prioritize Christian migrants over their Muslim counterparts. Merkel emphasized that such a discriminatory approach contradicts the fundamental principles of her party and the core values of Germany.

The tension between Merkel and the CSU has been palpable, particularly following CSU leader Horst Seehofer's threats to withdraw support for her during the 2017 campaign over the contentious migrant cap issue. This ongoing friction highlights the challenges Merkel faces within her own coalition as she navigates the complexities of public opinion on migration.

The atmosphere of rising anti-migrant sentiment has been exacerbated by concerns surrounding terrorism and crime, which some attribute to the influx of refugees. This has further complicated the political landscape, as parties like the AfD gain traction by advocating for stricter immigration controls and capitalizing on fears surrounding national security.

As Merkel reflects on her policies, there are growing concerns that she may encounter significant challenges in the upcoming federal elections. The shifting political climate, marked by increasing skepticism towards migrants, poses a potential threat to her leadership and the CDU's future electoral prospects.

In summary, Merkel's recent statements reveal a leader grappling with the consequences of her past decisions while facing mounting pressure from within her party and the electorate. As Germany continues to navigate the complexities of migration and integration, the implications of her policies will undoubtedly remain a focal point in the nation's political discourse.",-14.0,-19.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,473.0,-1.2666666666666666,-0.040169133192389
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

Sundsvall, Sweden – A Somali asylum seeker, identified as Abdullah, has been arrested following a violent incident involving his pregnant wife. Abdullah, who has a documented history of violent crimes and is known to local police, has been living off welfare benefits since his arrival in Sweden five years ago.

The incident occurred after Abdullah returned home from a night out with friends. Reports indicate that he had previously demanded that his wife’s niece, whom she was babysitting, leave the premises before his return. However, upon discovering that the niece was still present, Abdullah reacted with extreme aggression. Witnesses report that he physically assaulted his wife, kicking her in the head and stomach, causing significant distress and injury.

In a further act of humiliation, Abdullah poured beer over his wife and urinated on her, actions that have drawn widespread condemnation. This incident has raised serious concerns about domestic violence within the asylum-seeking community and the challenges faced by women in such situations.

The case has also sparked discussions about the interpretation and application of religious texts in the context of domestic relationships. Quran 4:34, which addresses the treatment of disobedient wives, has been referenced in relation to Abdullah's actions. Critics argue that Abdullah's selective adherence to Islamic teachings is evident in his behavior, particularly as he engages in activities such as alcohol consumption, which is prohibited in Islam, while simultaneously invoking religious justification for his abusive actions.

The incident has highlighted the complexities surrounding the integration of asylum seekers into Swedish society, particularly those with a history of violence. Abdullah's reliance on welfare benefits raises questions about the support systems in place for individuals who may pose a risk to others. Local authorities are now faced with the challenge of addressing not only the immediate safety of victims but also the broader implications of such violent behavior within the community.

As the investigation continues, community leaders and advocates for women's rights are calling for increased awareness and resources to support victims of domestic violence. They emphasize the need for comprehensive programs that address the root causes of such behavior and provide assistance to those affected.

The case serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing issues surrounding domestic violence and the importance of fostering a safe environment for all individuals, regardless of their background. As Abdullah awaits trial, the community remains vigilant, hoping for justice and a resolution that prioritizes the safety and well-being of victims.

This incident underscores the urgent need for dialogue and action to combat domestic violence, particularly within vulnerable populations. As Sweden grapples with the complexities of asylum and integration, the focus must remain on protecting those at risk and ensuring that such acts of violence are met with appropriate legal and social responses.",-28.0,-41.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,521.0,-2.05,-0.07869481765834933
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, Pennsylvania Republicans are advocating for House Bill 29, legislation that would permit voter intimidation on Election Day. First introduced in June, the bill aims to empower non-residents to monitor polling places and challenge voters, raising concerns about potential disruptions to the voting process.

Critics of the bill, including Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice, have voiced strong opposition, warning that the legislation could lead to discriminatory challenges based on race or religion. Gitlin argues that such practices could result in longer lines at polling stations and ultimately discourage voter participation. The implications of this bill are particularly alarming in a state where every vote counts, especially in a close race.

The bill appears to align closely with the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump, who has been vocal in encouraging his supporters to monitor polling areas to prevent what he claims is widespread voter fraud. Trump has even established a sign-up on his website for supporters to become poll watchers, framing their involvement as a necessary measure to combat alleged election rigging.

In a further attempt to expedite the bill's implementation, an amendment has been proposed that would allow House Bill 29 to take effect immediately upon passage, rather than the standard 60-day waiting period. This amendment is seen as a direct response to Trump's assertions regarding a rigged election, underscoring the political motivations behind the bill.

The stakes are particularly high in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that could play a pivotal role in the upcoming elections. With the potential for voter intimidation tactics to significantly benefit Trump and the Republican Party, the passage of this bill could have far-reaching consequences. Observers are concerned that if such tactics are successful in Pennsylvania, they could pave the way for similar legislation in other states, further eroding the integrity of the electoral process.

As the debate over House Bill 29 continues, advocates for voting rights are mobilizing to counter the proposed legislation. They argue that the right to vote should be protected and that any measures that could lead to intimidation or discrimination at the polls are fundamentally at odds with democratic principles. The potential for non-residents to challenge voters raises serious questions about the legitimacy of such actions and the impact they could have on the electoral landscape.

The push for House Bill 29 has ignited a fierce discussion about the balance between election security and voter rights. Proponents of the bill argue that it is necessary to ensure the integrity of the electoral process, while opponents contend that it opens the door to harassment and intimidation, particularly against marginalized communities.

As Pennsylvania Republicans continue to rally support for the bill, the implications of its passage loom large. With the election season heating up, the focus on voter intimidation tactics is likely to intensify, drawing national attention to the state and its electoral practices. The outcome of this legislative effort could set a precedent that resonates beyond Pennsylvania, influencing how elections are conducted across the country.

In a time when trust in the electoral process is already fragile, the introduction of House Bill 29 raises critical questions about the future of voting rights in America. As the state prepares for the upcoming elections, the eyes of the nation will be on Pennsylvania, watching closely to see how this contentious issue unfolds.",-19.0,-16.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,623.0,-0.7272727272727273,-0.025682182985553772

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an American Olympian fencer, made history as the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab. Her groundbreaking achievement has not only inspired many but also brought to light the challenges faced by Muslim athletes in the United States. Despite her success, Muhammad has openly expressed feelings of insecurity, recounting a troubling incident where someone followed her home from practice. This experience underscores the ongoing struggles against prejudice that many individuals in the Muslim community face.

In her reflections, Muhammad highlighted the severity of racist incidents, particularly violence against Muslims. She pointed to the rhetoric surrounding the Khan family, which has further fueled discussions about the treatment of Muslims in America. These incidents raise important questions about the state of acceptance and safety for Muslim Americans, especially in the wake of rising tensions and divisive narratives.

However, the article challenges the perception of America as an ""Islamophobic"" country. It notes that while hate crimes against Muslims are concerning, statistics reveal that Jews experience higher rates of hate crimes in the U.S. This comparison invites a deeper examination of the complexities surrounding discrimination and the various communities affected by it.

The author poses a thought-provoking question: if Muhammad perceives the United States as a hostile environment, why does she choose to remain? This inquiry suggests that conditions in many Muslim-majority countries may be far worse, prompting a reflection on the freedoms and safety that America offers. 

In contrast to the potential dangers that exist in some Muslim-majority nations, Muhammad's experiences in the U.S. highlight the opportunities available to her as an athlete and a public figure. Her journey serves as a reminder of the resilience and strength found within the Muslim community, even in the face of adversity. As she continues to break barriers in sports, Muhammad's story resonates as a call for understanding and unity in a diverse society.",-23.0,-10.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,362.0,-0.6666666666666666,-0.027624309392265192
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In recent days, the city of Charlotte has witnessed a troubling escalation of protests that have devolved into riots, following a police shooting involving a black officer and a black suspect. What began as a demonstration has transformed into a scene of chaos, raising serious questions about the motivations and actions of those involved.

The protests, which were initially framed as a response to police violence, have taken a dark turn, with many participants engaging in behavior that can only be described as thuggish. Rather than fostering a dialogue or seeking justice through peaceful means, these individuals have chosen to wreak havoc on their own community. The actions of these rioters have not only undermined the very cause they claim to support but have also inflicted harm on innocent bystanders and law enforcement officers alike.

One particularly disturbing incident highlights the troubling mindset of some protesters. Instead of offering assistance to an injured police officer, rioters were seen mocking him, reveling in the chaos they had created. This shocking display of disrespect and violence raises a critical question: how can a movement that purports to value black lives engage in such callous behavior towards individuals who are also part of the community?

The author of this piece expresses deep disdain for the actions of the protesters, labeling them as irresponsible and violent. It is difficult to reconcile the message of Black Lives Matter with the reality of what is happening on the streets of Charlotte. If the movement truly cared about black lives, one would expect its supporters to engage in peaceful protests rather than resorting to violence against one another. The irony is palpable; the very individuals who claim to advocate for justice are perpetuating a cycle of violence that harms their own community.

Moreover, the article raises concerns about the broader implications of the Black Lives Matter movement. There is a growing perception that many of its supporters are uneducated and prone to violence, which only serves to further alienate potential allies. This sweeping generalization, while controversial, reflects a sentiment that is becoming increasingly common among those who witness the chaos unfolding in Charlotte. The actions of a few can tarnish the reputation of an entire movement, and the behavior of some protesters is doing just that.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to unfold, it is essential to reflect on the consequences of these riots. The damage inflicted on local businesses, the injuries sustained by law enforcement, and the overall sense of fear that has gripped the community cannot be overlooked. The protesters, in their quest for justice, have inadvertently created an environment of chaos that undermines their own goals.

In conclusion, the events in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement. While the need for justice and accountability in policing is undeniable, the methods employed by some protesters raise serious questions about their commitment to the cause. The strong negative sentiment towards the movement and its supporters is a reflection of the frustration felt by many who are witnessing the violence and chaos that have erupted in the name of justice. It is time for a reevaluation of tactics and a return to peaceful dialogue, lest the movement lose sight of its original purpose.",-83.0,-78.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,610.0,-3.391304347826087,-0.12786885245901639
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In his final address at the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama reaffirmed his vision of a world governed by international cooperation, a stance that has drawn both fervent support and sharp criticism. Characterized by many as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal, Obama has faced backlash for his policies, including the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and an increasing acceptance of refugees.

During his speech, Obama advocated for a one world order, suggesting that the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms in the name of global security. He emphasized the importance of international institutions, particularly the United Nations, in achieving this security. ""Global security requires the support of international institutions,"" he stated, underscoring his belief that collaboration among nations is essential for a stable future.

However, the former president acknowledged the criticism he has received from Americans regarding his views. Despite this, he remained steadfast in his beliefs, asserting that the only freedom that should not be compromised is the right to self-defense. This declaration reflects a broader tension in American politics, where the balance between individual liberties and collective security continues to be a contentious issue.

The article expresses frustration with Obama's perceived arrogance and his unwillingness to compromise, highlighting the growing divisiveness in Washington D.C. Critics argue that his approach may further alienate those who feel their voices are not being heard. The expectation for representatives to find common ground seems increasingly unrealistic in a political landscape marked by polarization.

As Obama steps away from the presidency, his final address serves as a reminder of the challenges that lie ahead for both the United States and the global community. The call for a more interconnected world raises questions about the future of national sovereignty and the role of the U.S. in international governance, leaving many to ponder the implications of his vision for the years to come.",13.0,15.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,367.0,1.1538461538461537,0.04087193460490463
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of professional football, two names stand out, albeit for different reasons: Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. Both former starting quarterbacks have found themselves on the sidelines in the NFL, but their paths and public perceptions diverge significantly.

Tim Tebow, known for his positive demeanor and respectability, has garnered admiration from fans and peers alike. In contrast, Kaepernick has faced criticism, with some labeling him an ""idiot"" for his controversial actions during the National Anthem. This stark difference in public opinion highlights the complexities surrounding athletes and their expressions of beliefs.

Tebow has been relatively reserved in his comments regarding Kaepernick's National Anthem protest. He emphasizes the importance of standing for one's beliefs but insists that it should be done in a manner that respects the values of the nation. Tebow's perspective suggests that Kaepernick, who has become a high-paid bench player, is being disrespectful not only to fans but also to Americans at large. He believes that if Kaepernick wishes to protest, he should do so on his own time, rather than during a moment that many consider sacred.

The article further argues that claims of oppression in the United States are unfounded. It posits that no one in the country is truly oppressed, suggesting that such assertions are merely excuses for a lack of effort. The author points to the presidency of Barack Obama as a significant counterpoint to claims of systemic oppression, arguing that his election serves as evidence that opportunities are available to all.

Moreover, the article challenges the notion of oppression by linking it to a perceived lack of initiative in seeking employment. This perspective aligns with Tebow's own approach to his career, as he has consistently avoided negative press and focused on his aspirations, including his hopes of joining the New York Mets.

As the discussion around Kaepernick's methods of protest continues, Tebow's stance remains clear: there are more respectful and effective ways to express dissent. The article concludes with a dismissive remark towards Kaepernick, encapsulating the divide between the two athletes and their approaches to activism and respect for the nation.

In a landscape where athletes often use their platforms to voice their opinions, the contrasting views of Tebow and Kaepernick serve as a reminder of the complexities involved in public protest and the varying interpretations of respect and patriotism. As both men navigate their careers away from the starting quarterback position, their legacies will likely continue to be shaped by their actions and the public's response to them.",-6.0,-11.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,483.0,-0.6111111111111112,-0.022774327122153208
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

The ongoing debate surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border wall has intensified, with proponents emphasizing its role as a crucial national security measure beyond merely preventing illegal immigration. Historical parallels are drawn to China's Great Wall, which was constructed to fend off foreign invaders rather than to control the movement of people. This perspective underscores the wall's significance in safeguarding the nation from various threats.

The situation in Mexico, where drug cartels exert significant control, has raised alarms about the potential dangers posed by an unsecured border. The violence and instability associated with these cartels contribute to a high death toll, further complicating the security landscape. In light of these challenges, concerns have emerged regarding the possibility of terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Southern Border to gain entry into the United States.

A recent incident has highlighted these fears, as eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally cross into the U.S. from Mexico. The group was intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, a critical point of entry. Reports from unnamed federal agents and Border Patrol Council President Hector Garza indicate that this incident is part of a broader trend of illegal crossings that pose significant risks to national security.

Garza has pointed out that many individuals who attempt to enter the country illegally are not deported, complicating efforts to maintain border security. This situation has led to calls for stronger measures to protect the nation and support the dedicated work of Border Patrol agents. The need for enhanced security protocols is becoming increasingly urgent as the complexities of border management continue to evolve.

In the political arena, one presidential candidate has emerged as a vocal advocate for addressing these pressing issues. This candidate's commitment to strengthening border security resonates with those who prioritize national safety and the integrity of U.S. borders. As the conversation surrounding immigration and border security continues, the emphasis remains on the importance of a fortified border wall as a vital component of national defense.

As the nation grapples with these challenges, the call for a comprehensive approach to border security becomes ever more critical. The intersection of immigration, drug-related violence, and potential terrorist threats underscores the necessity for a robust and effective strategy to protect the United States from both external and internal dangers.",-13.0,-11.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,433.0,-0.6470588235294118,-0.025404157043879907

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

In a recent rally, a group of Haitians in the audience shared their positive experiences and unwavering support for former President Donald Trump. As they recounted their stories, the atmosphere was charged with enthusiasm, with attendees cheering for Trump and voicing their grievances regarding the Clintons' handling of Haiti.

Audience members expressed their discontent, alleging that the Clintons had vanished after receiving substantial funds intended for the Haitian people. They claimed that money meant to aid Haiti was instead funneled to Washington lobbyists and the White House, raising questions about the transparency and effectiveness of the aid distribution.

Further fueling the audience's frustration, claims emerged that Hillary Clinton opposed raising Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5, a move that many believe would significantly benefit the impoverished nation. As the rally progressed, the sentiments of the audience shifted, with their support for Trump becoming increasingly vocal while their criticisms of Hillary Clinton intensified.

Interestingly, media representatives present at the event departed early, missing the pivotal moment when the audience's sentiments turned against Hillary and rallied in favor of Trump. This decision has drawn criticism, with observers noting that the media failed to capture and report on the audience's views, which starkly contrasted with the prevailing narratives surrounding the political figures.

The rally highlighted a significant disconnect between the experiences of the Haitian community and the political narratives often portrayed in mainstream media.",-2.0,4.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,276.0,0.4444444444444444,0.014492753623188406
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate of heightened concern over terrorism, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reignited a contentious debate by proposing a ban on Muslim immigration until a better understanding of terrorism is achieved. This proposal has sparked significant backlash, particularly from Democrats, who have labeled it as racist. However, the argument can be made that racism pertains specifically to race, while Trump's proposal targets a religious group, raising questions about the definitions and implications of such labels.

The discussion surrounding Islam and its potential to lead to radicalization has gained traction, especially in light of various instances of violence perpetrated by extremists claiming to act in the name of Islam. This has led to a growing sentiment among the public that warrants a closer examination of immigration policies related to Muslim individuals.

Recent polling data from Australia reveals a notable shift in public opinion regarding Muslim immigration. A new survey indicates that 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration, a significant increase from just 28% in October of the previous year. This surge in support reflects a growing unease among the populace, with many citing fears of terrorism as a primary concern. Additionally, there are apprehensions regarding the integration of Muslim migrants into Australian society, further fueling the call for a ban.

The poll also highlights that 48% of voters are in favor of initiating a national debate on the issue, suggesting that the topic is not only relevant but also warrants serious discussion among policymakers and the public alike. This sentiment is echoed by two-thirds of Australians who believe that populist senator Pauline Hanson addresses topics that other politicians tend to avoid. Hanson's outspoken views on immigration and national security resonate with a significant portion of the electorate, indicating a desire for more direct conversations about these pressing issues.

Support for a ban on Muslim immigration appears to transcend traditional political affiliations. The poll reveals that 60% of Coalition supporters, 40% of Labour voters, and 34% of Green voters are in favor of such a measure. This broad base of support suggests that concerns about terrorism and integration are not confined to a single political ideology but are instead reflective of a wider societal apprehension.

The pollster behind the survey expressed surprise at the substantial backing for the ban, indicating that it mirrors broader societal views that may have been previously underestimated. This shift in public opinion underscores the importance of addressing the underlying fears and concerns that drive such sentiments, rather than dismissing them outright.

In the context of political discourse, the article critiques the approach taken by figures like Hillary Clinton, who have opposed views like Trump's without engaging with the underlying concerns of the electorate. The argument posits that acknowledging dissenting opinions and fostering a dialogue around them may prove to be a more effective strategy than outright condemnation. By recognizing the fears that fuel support for a ban on Muslim immigration, politicians can work towards addressing the root causes of these concerns, rather than simply labeling them as bigotry or racism.

As the debate continues to unfold, it is clear that the issue of Muslim immigration is not just a political talking point but a reflection of deeper societal anxieties. With nearly half of Australians now supporting a ban and a significant portion advocating for a national conversation on the topic, it is imperative for leaders to engage with these sentiments thoughtfully and constructively. The path forward will require a careful balance between national security concerns and the values of inclusivity and diversity that Australia holds dear.",2.0,12.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,665.0,0.5217391304347826,0.01804511278195489

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a shocking turn of events, a chaotic incident unfolded in the middle of a street, where a fight was anticipated. What began as a typical confrontation quickly escalated into a disturbing scene when an individual unexpectedly set those involved in the altercation on fire. Eyewitnesses described the atmosphere as chaotic, with people running in all directions, desperately trying to avoid being struck by oncoming vehicles.

The incident has drawn significant attention, particularly due to claims made by Buzzfeed that the description of the crime and its victims was false. However, these assertions have been debunked by the original source, reaffirming the gravity of the situation. The author of a recent commentary on the event has raised critical questions about the mindset of the person who threw the Molotov cocktail, suggesting that such an act indicates a level of premeditation that is deeply concerning.

Reflecting on the incident, the author contrasts the current behavior of bystanders with a nostalgic view of the past. There was a time when individuals would intervene to prevent harm during fights, stepping in to protect those in danger. This sense of community responsibility appears to have diminished, as many now seem more inclined to capture the moment on their smartphones for potential viral content rather than taking action to help those in peril.

The commentary serves as a critique of modern society's tendency to prioritize entertainment over empathy. In an age where social media reigns supreme, the author calls for a shift in mindset, urging individuals to care more about the well-being of others. The message is clear: rather than resorting to violence or passively observing, people should actively seek to assist those in distress.

As the dust settles from this chaotic incident, it serves as a stark reminder of the importance of community and the need for individuals to look out for one another. The author’s call to action resonates strongly in a world where the line between spectator and participant has blurred. It is a plea for a return to a time when compassion and intervention were the norms, rather than the exception.

In conclusion, the disturbing events of this street incident highlight not only the dangers of violence but also the critical need for a collective sense of responsibility. As society grapples with these issues, it is imperative that individuals reflect on their roles in such situations and strive to foster a culture of care and intervention, rather than one of indifference.",-5.0,-25.0,444.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.01126126126126126,465.0,-1.4705882352941178,-0.053763440860215055
Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- A border wall is deemed necessary for securing access points into America, beyond just preventing illegal immigration.

Luna County, New Mexico, is currently on high alert following a recent traffic stop that involved an undocumented woman from the Middle East. This incident has raised significant concerns regarding national security, particularly in relation to potential terrorist activities. The woman was reportedly found to have plans for a nearby gas pipeline, prompting fears that she may have been scouting the area for future attacks.

In response to the situation, the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, along with U.S. Border Patrol, conducted an investigation. Fortunately, they found no immediate threats linked to the woman. However, the mere presence of an undocumented Muslim woman near the U.S.-Mexico border has sparked alarm among local law enforcement and community members alike.

The pipeline in question is situated in a remote area, which has led to speculation that the woman’s intentions may have been more sinister than initially thought. This incident is not an isolated one; a 2015 report by Judicial Watch highlighted a troubling collaboration between Mexican cartels and terrorist organizations, indicating that individuals from terror-afflicted nations have been smuggled into the U.S. through Mexico. Furthermore, a 2017 report revealed that Islamic terror groups have been crossing the border to identify potential targets within the United States.

These developments have intensified calls for Congress to allocate funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Advocates argue that the wall is essential not only for preventing illegal immigration but also for safeguarding the nation against potential terrorist threats. The argument is that many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not solely from Mexico; rather, they often travel from further south, sometimes with the support of the Mexican government.

The situation in Luna County serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist along the southern border. Proponents of the border wall assert that it is a necessary measure to secure access points into America, emphasizing that the risks extend beyond illegal immigration. The potential for terrorists to exploit these vulnerabilities poses a significant threat to national security.

As the investigation continues and the community remains vigilant, the incident underscores the urgent need for comprehensive border security measures. The call for a fortified border wall is gaining momentum, as many believe it is crucial for protecting the nation from foreign threats and ensuring the safety of American citizens. The implications of this incident may resonate far beyond Luna County, as the debate over border security and immigration policy continues to unfold across the country.",-44.0,-32.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,465.0,-1.7777777777777777,-0.06881720430107527
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a world where the pressures of fame and success often overshadow personal values, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out as a beacon of hope and integrity. Wilson, known for his impressive skills on the football field, emphasizes a profound love for God and a commitment to helping others. His mission transcends the game, as he aims to serve and change lives, hoping to leave a legacy filled with joy.

On the field, Wilson is laser-focused on winning games and leading his team to victory. However, off the field, he channels his energy into promoting joy and peace through faith and good choices. This duality in his life reflects a deep-seated belief that success is not solely measured by touchdowns or championships, but by the positive impact one can have on the lives of others.

Despite the NFL's advice to refrain from discussing his faith publicly, Wilson remains steadfast in sharing his message through his actions. He believes that living out his faith is the most powerful testimony he can offer. By prioritizing God first, followed by family and friends, and then football, Wilson asserts that this order leads to great outcomes in all aspects of life. His commitment to this hierarchy is evident in his interactions with teammates, fans, and the community.

Wilson's perspective extends beyond personal success; he critiques individuals in positions of power who forget their roots and use their influence for self-glorification. In a time when corruption and deception seem rampant in leadership, particularly within the current political climate, Wilson's voice serves as a reminder of the importance of humility and service. He calls for leaders to remember their responsibilities to the people they serve, rather than succumbing to the allure of power and prestige.

The article raises concerns about a perceived double standard regarding freedom of speech, particularly when it comes to expressing faith. While some individuals face backlash for sharing their beliefs, others seem to escape scrutiny when disrespecting the country. This inconsistency raises questions about the values society holds dear and the importance of standing up for truth and righteousness.

Wilson's unwavering commitment to helping others prompts a critical examination of societal attitudes. When did the act of helping others become viewed negatively? In a culture that often prioritizes individualism and self-interest, Wilson's dedication to service stands in stark contrast. He embodies the belief that true fulfillment comes from lifting others up and making a difference in their lives.

As Wilson continues to navigate the challenges of being a professional athlete, he remains grounded in his faith and values. His journey serves as an inspiration to many, illustrating that success is not solely defined by accolades but by the legacy one leaves behind. By prioritizing faith, family, and service, Wilson exemplifies a life well-lived, one that resonates with joy and purpose.

In conclusion, Russell Wilson's approach to life and football is a testament to the power of faith and the importance of helping others. His commitment to serving and uplifting those around him, coupled with his critique of self-serving leadership, highlights the need for integrity and humility in all walks of life. As he continues to inspire both on and off the field, Wilson's legacy is sure to be one of joy, service, and unwavering faith.",79.0,105.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,626.0,4.038461538461538,0.16773162939297126
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a recent address, Pope Francis delivered a poignant critique of fear-based media, equating its impact to that of terrorism. His remarks, while specifically targeting the Italian press, were intended to resonate on a global scale, highlighting the pervasive influence of sensationalist journalism.

The Pope underscored the detrimental effects of journalism rooted in gossip and rumors, asserting that such practices can inflict harm not only on individuals but also on society as a whole. By fostering a culture of fear, the media can distort public perception and exacerbate societal tensions, leading to a climate of anxiety and mistrust.

Referencing a famous quote from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Pope reminded his audience that ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" This historical perspective serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by unchecked fear, particularly in a media landscape that often prioritizes sensationalism over factual reporting.

Despite a notable decrease in crime rates, a paradox has emerged in the United States: Americans are increasingly consumed by fear. This growing anxiety is largely influenced by media narratives that amplify concerns about crime and terrorism. Polls indicate a rising apprehension among the American populace regarding these issues, suggesting that fear has become a significant factor in shaping public opinion and political discourse.

In this context, Fox News has been identified as a primary source of fear-mongering within the media landscape. The network's emphasis on alarming headlines and sensational stories has contributed to a heightened sense of insecurity among viewers. This relentless focus on fear not only distorts reality but also plays a role in shaping political dynamics, including the rise of figures like Donald Trump, who have capitalized on public fears to garner support.

The Pope's comments serve as a call to action for journalists and media outlets to prioritize responsible reporting over sensationalism. By fostering a more informed and less fearful public, the media can contribute to a healthier societal discourse, one that encourages understanding and cooperation rather than division and anxiety.

As the media continues to evolve in the digital age, the challenge remains for journalists to navigate the fine line between reporting on legitimate concerns and perpetuating a culture of fear. Pope Francis's critique serves as a timely reminder of the responsibility that comes with the power of the press, urging a shift towards more ethical and constructive journalism.

In conclusion, the Pope's remarks highlight the urgent need for a reevaluation of media practices that prioritize fear over truth. By fostering a more balanced and responsible approach to journalism, society can work towards alleviating the pervasive anxieties that currently dominate public discourse.",-56.0,-28.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,496.0,-1.5555555555555556,-0.056451612903225805
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and

CNN's polling indicates that Hillary Clinton emerged victorious, garnering 62% of the votes compared to Donald Trump's 27%. However, other snap polls from various sources, including TIME Magazine, Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville, present a more mixed picture, with some suggesting Trump may have the edge.

Key topics during the debate included the Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and Trump's tax returns, all of which have been pivotal in shaping the candidates' narratives. Trump's supporters have rallied around the snap polls that favor him, with the candidate himself taking to Twitter to express gratitude for the positive feedback. In contrast, Clinton has yet to comment on the polling outcomes.

The validity of CNN's poll has come under scrutiny, particularly due to its Democrat-leaning sample, raising questions about whether the results accurately reflect the broader electorate's sentiments. Despite Clinton's apparent win in this specific poll, the overall impact on voter decisions remains uncertain, as mixed results from other sources suggest a divided electorate.

During the debate, Trump voiced his frustration over a malfunctioning microphone, which he claimed hindered his performance. He also suggested that he should have brought up Bill Clinton's infidelity, a topic that could have shifted the debate's dynamics. As the election date approaches, both candidates are acutely aware of the limited time they have to influence undecided voters.

Adding to the intrigue, Julian Assange has hinted at a potential October surprise release on Wikileaks that could significantly affect Clinton's campaign. With the stakes higher than ever, both candidates are strategizing to maximize their appeal to the electorate in the final stretch leading up to the election. As the debate fallout continues, the political landscape remains fluid, with voters closely watching the developments.",18.0,3.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,378.0,0.21428571428571427,0.007936507936507936
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

In the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, Hillary Clinton confidently declared victory, yet the reactions from various focus groups and social media suggest a more complex narrative. While Clinton's camp celebrated her performance, the sentiment among viewers appears to be divided.

Focus groups conducted by both Fox News and CNN indicated a favorable outcome for Clinton. CNN's focus group, comprised of Florida voters, reported an overwhelming 18-2 split in her favor. Similarly, Fox News, which surveyed voters from Pennsylvania, showed a 16-6 advantage for Clinton. These results seem to bolster her claim of victory, but they are not universally accepted.

Pollster Frank Luntz, who analyzed the debate, noted that while Trump struggled to articulate his tax policies, he gained traction when discussing Clinton's email scandal. This shift in momentum highlights the complexities of the debate, as Trump's performance varied significantly across different topics.

However, Trump's comments regarding Obama's birthplace drew significant backlash, overshadowing some of his stronger moments. In a separate poll, Trump was reported to have won with a staggering 92% to 8%, a stark contrast to the focus group findings that favored Clinton. This discrepancy raises questions about the effectiveness of the debate in swaying public opinion.

Following Clinton's declaration of victory on social media, a wave of backlash ensued, with the hashtag #TrumpWon trending globally. This reaction underscores the polarized nature of the electorate and the differing interpretations of the debate's outcome.

Critics have also pointed out Clinton's tendency to avoid media engagements following debates, which may impact her ability to capitalize on perceived victories. As the election season progresses, the implications of this debate and the reactions it elicited will likely continue to shape the political landscape. With both candidates facing scrutiny, the road to the presidency remains fraught with challenges and unexpected turns.",18.0,33.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,365.0,2.0625,0.09041095890410959
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted in Charlotte for the second consecutive night in response to the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, a tragic event that has ignited outrage and calls for justice across the city. The protests, which began peacefully with around 1,000 participants chanting ""Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,"" quickly escalated into chaos as tensions rose between demonstrators and law enforcement.

The situation took a dire turn when a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured during the protests. Initial reports from police indicated that the shooter was a civilian; however, eyewitness accounts have cast doubt on this narrative, suggesting that the shot may have come from law enforcement officers present at the scene.

Eyewitness Todd Zimmer took to Twitter to express his disbelief at the official account, stating, ""The city is lying about the incident."" His comments reflect a growing sentiment among protesters and bystanders who are questioning the police's version of events. Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, corroborated Zimmer's claims, noting that the gunshot he heard did not sound like a typical firearm. This discrepancy has fueled further speculation about the circumstances surrounding the shooting.

As the protests unfolded, the atmosphere shifted dramatically when riot police arrived on the scene. Eyewitnesses described the shooting of the protester as an ""ambush,"" with many asserting that law enforcement was responsible for the violence. The City of Charlotte quickly issued a statement claiming that the shooting was a result of civilian-on-civilian conflict, a narrative that has been met with skepticism by those who witnessed the events firsthand.

Clergy members and other additional eyewitnesses have come forward to refute the police's claims, asserting that the police shot the protester. Their testimonies add to the growing chorus of voices demanding accountability and transparency from law enforcement. Eddie Thomas, a man who witnessed the aftermath of the shooting, reported seeing a protester bleeding on the ground while receiving no assistance from police officers. This lack of response has raised serious concerns about the treatment of individuals during the protests and the role of law enforcement in escalating tensions.

The protests in Charlotte are not isolated incidents but rather part of a broader pattern of state violence in response to demonstrations by African-Americans expressing their frustrations. The killing of Kenneth L. Scott has become a flashpoint for long-standing grievances regarding police brutality and systemic racism. As the community grapples with the aftermath of these events, the calls for justice and accountability continue to grow louder.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by communities across the nation in their fight for justice and equality. As protests continue, the eyes of the nation remain focused on Charlotte, where the struggle for justice and the demand for accountability from law enforcement are at the forefront of public discourse.",-74.0,-49.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,542.0,-2.45,-0.09040590405904059
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, finds himself under increasing scrutiny for his foreign policy stance, particularly regarding Russia. Critics have raised alarms over what appears to be a troubling alignment with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government, raising questions about the implications for U.S. national security and foreign relations.

Trump's connections to Russia have been a focal point of concern, especially given his history of surrounding himself with individuals linked to the Kremlin. This network has reportedly included support from Russian state media and intelligence services, further complicating the narrative surrounding his candidacy. While Trump has publicly asserted that he has “ZERO investments in Russia,” an investigation by ABC News has unveiled a different story, revealing numerous ties to Russian interests that amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in business dealings.

The investigation highlights Trump's profitable ventures with Russian oligarchs, who have been known to leverage their wealth for influence. Notably, Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow, a high-profile event that not only showcased his brand but also solidified his connections within Russian elite circles. Additionally, he has engaged in real estate transactions with Russian buyers, a practice that has raised eyebrows among critics who argue that these dealings may serve as a means for oligarchs to launder money out of Russia.

Russian oligarchs, who amassed their fortunes during the transition to a free-market economy, have been described by former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev as materialistic and culturally ignorant, with a singular focus on personal wealth. This characterization underscores the potential motivations behind their financial interactions with Trump, suggesting that their investments in his properties may be more than mere business transactions; they could be strategic moves to gain favor and influence in the U.S.

The implications of Trump's financial ties to Russia become even more concerning in light of the 2014 sanctions imposed by the U.S. State Department on Russian oligarchs. As Trump campaigns for the presidency, questions arise about his potential willingness to lift these sanctions, which could not only benefit him personally but also reshape U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. This conflict of interest raises significant concerns about whether Trump can prioritize national interests over his financial entanglements.

Critics argue that the intertwining of Trump's business dealings and his foreign policy positions creates a precarious situation for the United States. The potential for personal gain to influence decisions on sanctions and diplomatic relations with Russia poses a serious threat to the integrity of U.S. foreign policy. As Trump continues to navigate the political landscape, the question remains: can he be trusted to act in the best interests of the nation, or will his financial interests dictate his actions?

The growing chorus of voices calling for accountability has led to renewed discussions about the possibility of impeachment. Many believe that Congress must take a stand against what they perceive as a clear conflict of interest that undermines the principles of democracy and national security. The call to action for Congress to impeach Donald Trump reflects a deep-seated concern that his presidency could pose a risk not only to U.S. foreign policy but also to the very fabric of American governance.

As the election draws nearer, the implications of Trump's ties to Russia will likely remain a contentious issue. Voters are faced with the challenge of discerning the truth behind the headlines and understanding the potential ramifications of electing a candidate with such a complex web of connections to a foreign adversary. The stakes are high, and the need for transparency and accountability has never been more critical.

In conclusion, the intersection of Donald Trump's foreign policy and his financial ties to Russia raises profound questions about his suitability for the presidency. As the nation grapples with these issues, the call for Congress to take decisive action underscores the urgency of addressing potential conflicts of interest that could jeopardize U.S. interests on the global stage. The path forward remains uncertain, but the implications of Trump's connections to Russia will undoubtedly shape the political landscape in the months to come.",27.0,6.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,761.0,0.24,0.00788436268068331
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing the looming threat of impeachment as the fallout from the ""Bridgegate"" scandal continues to unfold. Top state legislators are reportedly considering filing articles of impeachment against Christie if he is found guilty of orchestrating the controversial closures of the George Washington Bridge, which were allegedly intended to punish a political rival.

The scandal, which has drawn significant public attention and scrutiny, resulted in severe traffic jams that not only inconvenienced thousands of commuters but also had tragic consequences, including the death of one individual in an ambulance. The implications of the scandal have reached a critical juncture, with a judge recently ordering Christie to produce personal emails related to the incident, further intensifying the investigation into his involvement.

The decision to move forward with impeachment proceedings now rests in the hands of Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. For the impeachment to advance, a majority vote in the 80-member Assembly is required. If the Assembly votes in favor of impeachment, the process would then move to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be necessary to convict Christie.

Federal prosecutors have recently implicated Christie in the Bridgegate scandal during a trial involving three of his senior aides, adding to the mounting pressure on the governor. The allegations against him have raised serious questions about his leadership and accountability, particularly given his previous denials of knowledge regarding the scandal. In a press conference held in January 2014, shortly after the scandal broke, Christie asserted that he had no prior knowledge of the events that transpired.

However, revelations have since emerged indicating that Christie was informed about the scandal during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 but failed to take any action. This information has further complicated his defense and has contributed to a significant decline in his political standing.

Christie's political career has seen a dramatic shift in recent years. Once viewed as a rising star within the Republican Party, his endorsement of Donald Trump marked a controversial turning point. Many observers have interpreted this endorsement as a move of political debasement, reflecting a broader trend of shifting allegiances within the party.

As the situation continues to develop, the potential for impeachment looms large over Christie's administration. The implications of the Bridgegate scandal extend beyond the governor's office, raising questions about the integrity of political leadership in New Jersey and the accountability of elected officials.

The unfolding events surrounding Christie serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of political maneuvering and the potential fallout from decisions made in the pursuit of power. With the possibility of impeachment on the horizon, the governor's future remains uncertain, and the eyes of the nation are watching closely as this political drama continues to unfold.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a heated Republican primary debate in September 2015, Donald Trump made a bold assertion regarding his past interactions with Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida. Trump claimed that he never lobbied Bush for casino gambling, stating emphatically, “If I wanted it, I would have gotten it.” This statement, however, raises significant questions about the veracity of Trump’s claims, particularly in light of his previous admissions during a 2007 deposition where he acknowledged that he had indeed pushed for casino gambling in Florida.

The conflicting narratives presented by Trump during the debate and in the deposition suggest a troubling inconsistency that cannot be overlooked. If Trump’s assertion during the debate is to be believed, it implies that he either lied to the American public or committed perjury in his earlier legal testimony. This contradiction is not merely a matter of political rhetoric; it touches on the fundamental issue of honesty and integrity in public office.

Jeb Bush, in response to Trump’s claims during the debate, countered with a firm rebuttal. He asserted that Trump had indeed sought to influence him regarding casino gambling, directly challenging Trump’s narrative. Bush’s insistence on the truth of his statement adds weight to the argument that Trump’s claims may not hold water. The exchange between the two candidates highlights the contentious nature of their relationship and the broader implications of Trump’s statements.

The significance of Trump’s potential dishonesty cannot be understated. It draws parallels to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced severe consequences for lying under oath. The comparison raises critical questions about accountability and the standards to which public officials should be held. If Trump is found to have lied, it could set a dangerous precedent for future leaders, undermining the trust that the American public places in their elected officials.

Moreover, the implications of Trump’s tendency to distort the truth extend beyond mere political posturing. The article argues that such behavior poses a tangible danger to national safety. When a leader is willing to manipulate facts and mislead the public, it can erode the foundations of democracy and compromise the integrity of governance. The stakes are high, and the need for transparency and honesty in leadership has never been more crucial.

To illustrate the conflicting statements made by Trump, the article includes excerpts from both the debate and the 2007 deposition. In the deposition, Trump stated, “I was pushing for casino gambling in Florida. I thought it would be a great opportunity.” This admission starkly contrasts with his later claims during the debate, where he insisted he had never lobbied Bush. The juxtaposition of these statements raises serious concerns about Trump’s credibility and the reliability of his assertions.

The debate transcript reveals Trump’s confident demeanor as he dismissed the notion that he had ever sought to influence Bush. “I never lobbied him,” Trump stated, “If I wanted it, I would have gotten it.” This bravado, however, stands in stark contrast to the reality presented in his deposition, where he openly acknowledged his efforts to push for casino gambling. The inconsistency between these two accounts is troubling and warrants further scrutiny.

As the article delves deeper into the implications of Trump’s statements, it becomes clear that the issue at hand is not merely a matter of political rivalry. It is about the integrity of the office of the presidency and the trust that the American people place in their leaders. The potential for dishonesty at such a high level raises alarms about the future of American democracy.

In light of these revelations, the article concludes with a call to action for Congress to take decisive steps toward accountability. The question of whether Trump lied during the debate or committed perjury in his deposition is not just a legal matter; it is a moral one. The American public deserves leaders who are honest and transparent, and it is the responsibility of Congress to uphold these standards.

The call for impeachment is not made lightly. It is a reflection of the gravity of the situation and the need for a thorough investigation into Trump’s statements. If it is determined that Trump has indeed lied or misled the public, it is imperative that Congress act to restore integrity to the office of the presidency.

In conclusion, the conflicting statements made by Donald Trump regarding his lobbying efforts for casino gambling raise serious questions about his honesty and integrity. The implications of these discrepancies extend beyond the political arena, touching on the very foundations of American democracy. As the nation grapples with the consequences of leadership that may be built on a foundation of lies, the call for accountability becomes ever more urgent. The American people deserve better, and it is time for Congress to take a stand for truth and integrity in governance.",-29.0,-8.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,930.0,-0.21621621621621623,-0.008602150537634409
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a drinking game during a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN.

- The Surgeon General cautioned that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related issues following the debate.
- Viewers are advised to drink responsibly during upcoming debates, suggesting ""baby sips"" for Trump's lies.","**Surgeon General Warns Against Drinking Games During CNN Debate**

In a striking reminder of the potential dangers associated with drinking games, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a warning ahead of a recent 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN. Many viewers engaged in a drinking game, consuming alcohol each time former President Donald Trump made a false statement. Murthy cautioned that such a practice could lead to serious health risks, including alcohol poisoning.

The Surgeon General's concerns are not unfounded. In 2012, there were approximately 70,000 incidents of alcohol poisoning linked to drinking games during political debates. With the current Republican candidates, Murthy emphasized the heightened risks associated with drinking games, particularly in light of Trump's history of making misleading statements.

Prior to the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump on September 26, 2016, Murthy had already reiterated his warnings about the dangers of drinking whenever Trump lied. This caution is particularly relevant given a recent study by Politico, which reported that Trump told 87 lies over a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, averaging a lie every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Based on this average, it is estimated that Trump likely made around 28 false statements during the CNN debate.

In anticipation of potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate, first responders were reportedly preparing for a surge in calls related to drinking games. Murthy's warning serves as a crucial reminder for viewers to drink responsibly during upcoming debates. He suggested that participants consider taking ""baby sips"" whenever Trump lies, rather than consuming larger quantities of alcohol.

As political debates continue to captivate audiences, the Surgeon General's message underscores the importance of moderation and awareness of the risks associated with drinking games. With the stakes high and the potential for misinformation prevalent, viewers are encouraged to prioritize their health and safety while engaging in political discourse.",-17.0,-19.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,349.0,-1.3571428571428572,-0.054441260744985676
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the aftermath of a recent debate, mainstream media outlets widely declared Hillary Clinton the victor, praising her performance and articulating a strong case for her candidacy. However, a stark contrast emerged in the realm of social media, where online polls and Twitter trends suggested a different narrative. The hashtag #TrumpWon surged in popularity across the United States, indicating a significant portion of the public felt differently about the debate's outcome.

Interestingly, the hashtag #TrumpWon has its origins traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. This revelation raises concerns about the influence of foreign entities on American political discourse. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has been known to employ cyber-trolls as part of a broader strategy to advance his agenda through disinformation campaigns. These tactics are designed to sow discord and amplify divisions among U.S. allies, creating an environment of confusion and mistrust.

In addition to these online maneuvers, Russian state-controlled media has been actively promoting Donald Trump to European audiences. This promotion aligns with Putin's strategic interests, particularly his desire to manipulate Trump into lifting the economic sanctions that were imposed following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. The implications of such foreign influence on American politics are profound, raising questions about the integrity of the electoral process.

Ex-bloggers who have worked in this disinformation sphere have described their working conditions as harsh, with strict oversight and penalties for performance. This insight into the operations of Russian cyber-trolls underscores the need for vigilance among the American public when engaging with online content. The article warns against placing undue trust in online polls and encourages users to be cautious when interacting with potentially Russian trolls online.

As the debate continues over the implications of these findings, there is a growing call to action for Congress to take decisive steps. Advocates are urging lawmakers to consider impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump, citing concerns over his potential collusion with foreign powers and the impact of such relationships on national security.

In a time when the lines between fact and fiction are increasingly blurred, the American public is urged to remain informed and skeptical of the narratives that dominate both mainstream media and social media platforms. The integrity of democracy hinges on the ability to discern truth from manipulation, making it imperative for citizens to engage critically with the information they consume.",-9.0,13.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,436.0,0.7647058823529411,0.02981651376146789
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor. The lawsuit alleges that the company has engaged in systematic discrimination against Asian job applicants during its hiring process, raising significant concerns about the fairness and integrity of its employment practices.

As a contractor for the federal government, including agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA), Palantir is expected to adhere to strict non-discriminatory hiring standards. However, the lawsuit highlights troubling statistics regarding the company’s hiring practices for engineering intern positions. According to the allegations, out of 130 applicants for these roles, a striking 73% were Asian. Yet, the hiring outcomes reveal a stark disparity: only four Asian candidates were selected for the positions, compared to 17 non-Asian hires. This discrepancy raises serious questions about the company’s commitment to equitable hiring practices.

The Department of Labor has estimated that the likelihood of such an outcome occurring by chance is a staggering one in a billion, suggesting that the hiring patterns at Palantir may not be coincidental. This statistic underscores the gravity of the allegations and the potential implications for the company, which has built its reputation on data-driven decision-making.

Peter Thiel, who has been a significant figure in the tech industry as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has a complex public persona. A first-generation immigrant himself, Thiel is known for his support of former President Donald Trump, who has taken a strong stance against immigration. This juxtaposition of Thiel’s background and his political affiliations adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing lawsuit, as it raises questions about the values and practices within the company he controls.

Thiel has also made headlines for his controversial actions outside of his business ventures, including funding Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker, which ultimately led to the bankruptcy of the media site. His public persona was further solidified when he became the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention, where he expressed pride in his identity while simultaneously criticizing government incompetence. Despite the positive reception of his speech, the Republican Party adopted an anti-LGBT platform during the same convention, highlighting the contradictions within the party’s stance on social issues.

The Department of Labor’s lawsuit against Palantir serves as a reminder of the responsibilities that federal contractors have in ensuring non-discriminatory hiring practices. The agency emphasizes that all companies engaged in government contracts must uphold these standards to foster an inclusive and equitable workforce. The outcome of this lawsuit could have significant ramifications not only for Palantir but also for other federal contractors who may be scrutinized for their hiring practices.

In response to the allegations, a spokeswoman for Palantir has stated that the company will vigorously defend itself against the claims made by the Department of Labor. The company’s commitment to contesting the lawsuit indicates that it is prepared to challenge the evidence presented and assert its hiring practices as fair and compliant with federal regulations.

As the case unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor the developments surrounding Palantir Technologies and the implications of the lawsuit for the broader tech industry. The outcome may not only impact the company’s reputation but could also set a precedent for how federal contractors approach hiring practices in the future. The allegations of discrimination against Asian applicants raise important questions about diversity and inclusion in the tech sector, an industry that has faced ongoing scrutiny over its lack of representation.

In conclusion, the federal lawsuit against Palantir Technologies highlights significant issues related to employment discrimination and the responsibilities of federal contractors. As the case progresses, it will be essential to observe how the company navigates these allegations and what measures, if any, are taken to address the concerns raised by the Department of Labor. The implications of this lawsuit could resonate far beyond Palantir, potentially influencing hiring practices across the tech industry and beyond.",-18.0,-23.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,749.0,-0.8846153846153846,-0.030707610146862484

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

The investigation into the Chelsea bombing that occurred last Saturday, injuring 29 people, is gaining momentum as police pursue several significant leads. The attack, which sent shockwaves through the community, has prompted law enforcement to delve deeper into the circumstances surrounding the incident.

In a critical development, a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster just four blocks away from the site of the initial explosion. This discovery has raised alarms and intensified the urgency of the investigation, as authorities work to determine whether the two incidents are connected.

Three notable leads have emerged in the ongoing investigation, each providing potential insights into the motives and identity of the perpetrator. 

The first lead involves a hand-written letter that was found alongside the second bomb. This letter, which is partially written in Arabic, has become a focal point for investigators as they attempt to decipher its contents and understand its relevance to the bombing. The presence of the letter raises questions about the motivations behind the attack and whether it was part of a larger plan.

The second lead comes from an unidentified male caller who contacted 911 to issue a chilling warning about further explosions. The caller ominously stated, “There will be more,” prompting immediate concern among law enforcement and the public alike. This warning has heightened fears of additional attacks and has led to increased security measures in the area.

The third lead is a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ which claims to be the bomber's manifesto. The post expresses grievances against various societal issues, including the oppression of the LGBTQ+ community and other inequalities. The individual behind the post claims responsibility for the explosions and expresses a disturbing intent to continue their actions, stating, “This is not the end, this is just the beginning.” 

While the claims made on the Tumblr page have drawn significant attention, there is a growing skepticism regarding their authenticity. Authorities are concerned that individuals may be attempting to exploit the situation for notoriety or attention, complicating the investigation further. The potential for misinformation and false claims adds an additional layer of complexity as police work to sift through the evidence and determine the truth behind the bombing.

As the investigation unfolds, the community remains on edge, grappling with the aftermath of the attack and the uncertainty of what may come next. The police are urging anyone with information related to the bombing or the leads that have emerged to come forward, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in ensuring safety and security.

In the wake of the bombing, local officials have reiterated their commitment to protecting the public and addressing the underlying issues that may have contributed to the attack. The investigation is not only focused on identifying the perpetrator but also on understanding the broader societal factors that may have influenced their actions.

As the police continue to investigate these leads, the community is left to navigate the fear and anxiety that such an event brings. The hope is that through diligent investigation and community cooperation, those responsible for the Chelsea bombing will be brought to justice, and measures can be taken to prevent future incidents. 

The coming days will be crucial as authorities work to piece together the evidence and provide answers to a community seeking closure and reassurance in the wake of this tragic event.",-25.0,-19.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,624.0,-0.8260869565217391,-0.030448717948717948
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As Donald Trump intensifies his campaign efforts at the age of 70, questions surrounding his mental fitness for an upcoming debate with Hillary Clinton have come to the forefront. With a packed schedule that includes last-minute rallies, the former president is under significant pressure as he prepares for what many consider a pivotal moment in his campaign.

Recent observations have raised eyebrows regarding Trump's ability to maintain coherence and focus. A particularly troubling tweet has drawn criticism for its disjointed nature, as it attempted to address three unrelated topics: a shooting in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina. The lack of clarity in the message has led some to speculate that Trump may be struggling to keep his thoughts organized, a concern that could have serious implications for his performance in the debate.

Critics argue that such signs of stress and incoherence could hinder Trump's ability to effectively engage with Clinton during the debate. The stakes are high, and the pressure to perform well is mounting. As Trump juggles his campaign commitments, the question of whether he is mentally prepared for the challenge looms large.

The implications of Trump's mental state extend beyond the debate stage. Observers are beginning to wonder if his current condition could impact the overall viability of his campaign. With the election season heating up, the ability to communicate clearly and effectively is more crucial than ever. The disarray evident in his recent tweet may serve as a warning sign, suggesting that the former president's focus is wavering at a critical juncture.

As the debate approaches, the spotlight will undoubtedly be on Trump, not only for his policies and positions but also for his mental acuity. Voters and political analysts alike will be watching closely to see if he can rise to the occasion or if the mounting pressures of the campaign will prove too much to handle.

In a political landscape where perception is often as important as reality, Trump's mental fitness could play a decisive role in shaping the outcome of the debate and, ultimately, his campaign. As the countdown to the debate continues, the question remains: Is Trump prepared to face Clinton, or will his mental state hinder his chances?",-22.0,1.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,427.0,0.0625,0.00234192037470726

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474291954000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-HZMqIkGoU,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton.

Delaware, Ohio – Hillary Clinton's campaign faced a disappointing turnout during a door-knocking event held on a sunny afternoon, scheduled for 1 PM. The event, which was anticipated to attract a significant number of volunteers eager to support Clinton's candidacy, ended up being a stark reminder of the challenges her campaign is currently facing.

As the clock struck one, the campaign office was well-prepared, with staff members ready to mobilize volunteers for the grassroots effort. However, to the surprise of the campaign team, only one individual showed up to document the event—a supporter of Donald Trump. The presence of the Trump supporter quickly raised eyebrows among Clinton's campaign staff, who eventually asked him to leave after realizing his affiliation.

The lack of volunteers at the event is particularly concerning, as it highlights potential issues with Clinton's ground game in Ohio and beyond. The campaign had hoped to rally local supporters and create momentum ahead of the upcoming election, but the solitary attendance of a Trump supporter instead underscored the challenges they face in galvanizing enthusiasm among voters.

This event has sparked discussions about Clinton's support in other states, with many observers questioning whether her campaign can effectively compete against the fervor surrounding Trump's rallies. While Trump has been drawing large crowds and generating significant excitement among his base, Clinton's campaign appears to be struggling to replicate that level of engagement.

The stark contrast between the two candidates' events raises alarms for Clinton's team. Trump's packed rallies have become a hallmark of his campaign, showcasing his ability to energize supporters and draw in new voters. In contrast, Clinton's door-knocking event in Delaware serves as a troubling indicator of her campaign's current state, suggesting that she may be losing ground in key battleground states.

Political analysts are expressing skepticism about Clinton's chances in the upcoming election, citing various factors that could hinder her campaign. Trump's lead in the polls, combined with the enthusiasm he has generated among his supporters, presents a formidable challenge for Clinton as she seeks to secure her position in the race.

The implications of this event extend beyond Ohio, as it raises questions about Clinton's overall strategy and ability to connect with voters. With the election drawing closer, the need for a robust ground game has never been more critical. The lack of volunteers at the door-knocking event may signal deeper issues within Clinton's campaign infrastructure, potentially jeopardizing her chances of success in the election.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Clinton's team will need to address these concerns head-on. The ability to mobilize supporters and create a sense of urgency among voters will be essential if she hopes to close the gap with Trump and regain momentum in the race.

In conclusion, the door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, serves as a cautionary tale for Clinton's campaign. With only one attendee, a Trump supporter, showing up to document the occasion, the event highlights the challenges she faces in rallying support. As the election approaches, the need for a strong ground game and enthusiastic volunteers will be crucial for Clinton to compete effectively against Trump's energized base. The road ahead appears steep, and the stakes have never been higher.",-7.0,30.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,623.0,1.3043478260869565,0.048154093097913325

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a recent bombing in New York City, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his immediate and pointed reactions. Trump, who accurately described the incident as a ""bombing,"" has found himself at the center of a media storm, particularly with CNN's coverage of the event.

CNN's criticism of Trump’s terminology has raised eyebrows, especially considering that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used the same description to refer to the attack. However, in a move that has sparked controversy, CNN edited out Clinton's reference to the bombing in their coverage, leading to accusations of bias and selective reporting.

During an interview on Fox and Friends, Trump did not hold back in his condemnation of CNN's actions. He labeled the network as ""disgusting and disgraceful,"" accusing them of dishonesty in their reporting. Trump further referred to CNN as the ""Clinton news network,"" suggesting that the outlet is biased in favor of the former Secretary of State and her political agenda.

In addition to his criticisms of the media, Trump took the opportunity to address what he perceives as a broader issue of leadership in the fight against terrorism. He expressed frustration with what he described as ""stupid"" leaders who have adopted a soft approach to terrorism. Trump emphasized the need for a tougher stance, arguing that the current leadership is failing to adequately protect the nation from threats.

A significant part of Trump's commentary focused on the issue of refugees, particularly in light of the ongoing crisis in Syria. He expressed deep concerns about the influx of refugees into the United States, specifically criticizing former President Barack Obama’s plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017. Trump claimed that Clinton, if elected, would seek to increase that number significantly, which he believes poses a risk to national security.

Trump has been vocal about his belief that the current vetting process for refugees is insufficient. He argued that the leadership has allowed thousands of individuals to enter the country without proper oversight, raising alarms about the potential dangers this could pose. His comments reflect a broader narrative he has maintained throughout his political career, advocating for stricter immigration policies and enhanced security measures.

The fallout from the bombing and the subsequent media coverage has reignited discussions about the state of national security and the effectiveness of current policies. Trump's remarks resonate with a segment of the population that shares his concerns about terrorism and immigration, while also highlighting the contentious relationship between the former president and major news outlets like CNN.

As the situation continues to unfold, the debate over how best to address terrorism and immigration remains a hot-button issue in American politics. Trump's call for a tougher approach and his criticisms of the media are likely to keep these topics at the forefront of public discourse in the coming weeks.

In summary, the bombing in New York City has not only prompted immediate reactions from Trump but has also sparked a broader conversation about national security, media bias, and the challenges of managing refugee influxes. As the nation grapples with these complex issues, the responses from political leaders and media outlets will undoubtedly shape the narrative moving forward.",-45.0,-14.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,618.0,-0.6363636363636364,-0.022653721682847898

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

In a surprising turn of events, Ahmad Rahami, a known terrorist and murderer, has filed a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey, claiming discrimination against his family based on their cultural background. The lawsuit, which also includes his father, Mohammad Rahami Sr., and his brother, Mohammad, alleges a pattern of harassment directed at their family-owned chicken restaurant, established in 2002.

The Rahami family, originally from Afghanistan, asserts that they have been subjected to unwarranted scrutiny and harassment from local officials. They report receiving numerous tickets and court summonses that they believe lack valid grounds. The family claims that their restaurant has been unfairly targeted, particularly for remaining open past 10 PM, despite having the necessary permissions to do so.

In the lawsuit, the Rahami family alleges that they have faced racial abuse, including derogatory comments such as ""Muslims don’t belong here."" This claim highlights the family's belief that their cultural identity has played a significant role in the treatment they have received from local authorities. The lawsuit accuses the police of violating their constitutional rights and engaging in a campaign of harassment aimed at forcing the restaurant to close early.

The police department, according to the lawsuit, justified their actions by citing ""too much crime"" in the area. However, the Rahami family contends that this rationale is unfounded and serves as a pretext for discriminatory practices against them. The family's claims raise serious questions about the motivations behind the police's actions and whether they reflect broader issues of racial profiling and discrimination.

The timing of the lawsuit is particularly notable, as it comes five years after Ahmad Rahami was arrested for planting bombs in New York City and New Jersey. His criminal activities have cast a long shadow over the family's claims, leading to skepticism regarding their motivations. Critics may question whether the lawsuit is a genuine attempt to seek justice for alleged discrimination or a strategic move to deflect attention from Ahmad's past actions.

As the case unfolds, it will likely draw significant public interest, not only due to the serious nature of the allegations but also because of Ahmad Rahami's notorious background. The outcome of this lawsuit could have implications for how law enforcement interacts with minority communities and addresses claims of discrimination and harassment.

The Rahami family's legal battle against the Elizabeth police is set to begin, and it remains to be seen how the court will respond to the allegations of discrimination and harassment. As the legal proceedings progress, the case will undoubtedly continue to spark discussions about race, culture, and the responsibilities of law enforcement in diverse communities.",-49.0,-55.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,511.0,-3.0555555555555554,-0.10763209393346379
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have emerged regarding potential pay-to-play corruption involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the foundation's financial practices and its true purpose. The Clinton campaign has responded to these allegations by emphasizing the charitable work of the foundation, but critics argue that it primarily functions as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates.

In 2014, scrutiny intensified as IRS filings revealed that only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants. This figure has raised eyebrows, particularly when considering the foundation's total spending that year, which approached $91.3 million. Of this amount, less than $5.2 million was directed towards charitable causes, prompting critics to question the foundation's commitment to philanthropy.

The financial breakdown of the foundation's expenditures in 2014 further fueled concerns. A significant portion of the budget—$34.8 million—was spent on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, while an additional $50.4 million was categorized as ""other expenses."" This allocation of funds has led to accusations that the foundation is more focused on enriching the Clintons and their associates rather than fulfilling its purported charitable mission.

Moreover, the foundation's charitable spending saw a notable decline in 2014, decreasing by 40% compared to the previous year, despite an increase of $30 million in revenue. This contradiction has raised alarms among critics, who argue that the foundation's financial practices do not align with its stated goals. The increase in salaries and other expenses by $5 million in the same year has only added to the skepticism surrounding the foundation's operations.

As the allegations continue to unfold, the narrative suggests that the Clinton Foundation may have served as a means for the Clintons to generate wealth. Critics assert that Hillary Clinton allegedly leveraged her position as Secretary of State for financial gain, further complicating the foundation's image and raising ethical questions about the intersection of politics and philanthropy.

In conclusion, the ongoing scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation highlights significant concerns regarding its financial practices and the potential for corruption. As the debate continues, the foundation's role as a charitable organization is increasingly being called into question, with many asserting that it primarily benefits the Clintons and their associates rather than the intended charitable causes.",25.0,9.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,439.0,0.6,0.02050113895216401

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York, former President Barack Obama has ignited a wave of criticism from the public and political commentators alike. Many Americans were left shocked and dismayed by his apparent indifference to recent acts of violence that have shaken the nation, including bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing incident in Minnesota over the weekend.

The atmosphere was charged with expectation as citizens looked to their elected officials for a statement of solidarity in the wake of these tragic events. Instead, Obama chose to focus his remarks on a high-dollar fundraiser, where he criticized sexism in the media and expressed his support for Hillary Clinton. This decision has drawn ire from those who believe that the former President should have prioritized addressing the victims and the broader implications of the attacks.

Critics have labeled Obama as ""useless"" and ""arrogant,"" arguing that his failure to acknowledge the violence reflects a troubling disconnect from the realities facing the American public. The expectation was clear: in times of crisis, leaders are called upon to unite and reassure their constituents. However, Obama’s choice to sidestep the pressing issues at hand has left many feeling abandoned and frustrated.

While some have defended the former President, suggesting that he may not have had sufficient information to comment on the incidents, the author of this article firmly believes that a basic acknowledgment of the violence was not only warranted but necessary. The public deserves to hear from their leaders in moments of crisis, and silence can often be interpreted as indifference.

The bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with the stabbing in Minnesota, represent a serious escalation in domestic violence and terrorism. These incidents have left communities reeling and searching for answers. In such a climate, the absence of a compassionate response from a prominent figure like Obama is particularly jarring. The expectation for leaders to provide comfort and solidarity is not merely a formality; it is a crucial aspect of their role in guiding the nation through difficult times.

The author expresses outrage at Obama’s failure to address the situation directly. In a moment when many were looking for reassurance and a sense of unity, the former President’s focus on fundraising and political commentary felt misplaced. The juxtaposition of his high-profile event against the backdrop of violence has led to a growing sentiment that he is out of touch with the concerns of everyday Americans.

As the nation grapples with the implications of these violent acts, the need for leadership that prioritizes the well-being of its citizens has never been more apparent. The public's expectation for a response from elected officials is not just about words; it is about the acknowledgment of pain and the commitment to stand against violence in all its forms.

In conclusion, Obama’s recent speech has sparked a significant backlash, highlighting the disconnect between political leaders and the realities faced by the American public. As the nation seeks healing and understanding in the aftermath of violence, the call for leaders to step up and address these issues with sincerity and compassion remains urgent. The hope is that future responses will reflect a deeper understanding of the responsibilities that come with leadership, especially in times of crisis.",-25.0,-54.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,616.0,-2.4545454545454546,-0.08766233766233766
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

Recent developments have heightened public awareness of potential corruption at the Clinton Foundation, particularly since Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A new report has surfaced, indicating that the foundation is grappling with more serious issues than previously understood.

The Daily Caller has reported alarming findings regarding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), which is one of the foundation's most significant and well-known initiatives. According to the report, CHAI distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, raising concerns about the efficacy of treatments provided to vulnerable populations. A draft congressional report suggests that this practice may have increased risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these medications.

The implications of these findings could lead to intensified scrutiny of the Clinton charity, especially as Hillary Clinton embarks on her presidential campaign. The distribution of diluted drugs not only raises ethical questions but also casts a shadow over the foundation's reputation and its commitment to public health.

Furthermore, the congressional study has unveiled connections between Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-American figures who are currently under investigation by the FDA and SEC. The report specifically highlights the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical firm notorious for its history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

While the extent of how many AIDS patients received the ""watered-down"" drugs remains unclear, the revelations have sparked calls for immediate action. Critics are urging for the shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further harm to those it aims to serve.

As the situation unfolds, the Clinton Foundation faces mounting pressure to address these serious allegations and restore public trust in its operations.

Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for enacting poorly worded laws that have significant implications for parenting activities. A recent law, intended to protect children from molesters, has raised serious concerns among legal experts and parents alike due to its vague language and unintended consequences.

One of the most alarming aspects of the law is its criminalization of any contact between an adult and a child's genitals. This broad definition means that parents could potentially be classified as felons for engaging in normal, everyday activities such as diaper changes or baths. Critics argue that while the law's intention is to safeguard children, it fails to account for innocent parental actions that are essential to child-rearing.

The Arizona Supreme Court has further complicated the situation by ruling that defendants accused under this law must prove a lack of sexual intent. This ruling undermines the fundamental presumption of innocence, placing an undue burden on parents who may find themselves facing serious charges for actions that are not only innocent but necessary. The court's decision suggests a troubling reliance on the discretion of prosecutors, who are encouraged to use common sense rather than revising the problematic law.

Legal expert John Pfaff has pointed out the implications of this ruling, particularly concerning plea bargaining. Defendants may feel pressured to accept plea deals due to the threat of severe charges, even if they are innocent. This dynamic raises concerns about the potential for wrongful convictions, as parents could be coerced into admitting guilt to avoid the harsh penalties associated with child molestation laws.

The ruling has significant ramifications for the constitutional rights and due process of Arizona's parents and caregivers. The legal landscape is now fraught with uncertainty, as parents navigate the complexities of a law that could easily misinterpret their actions. The overarching sentiment among critics is one of skepticism regarding the government's ability to make sound decisions in this context, particularly when the stakes involve the well-being of children and the rights of parents.

As the debate continues, many are calling for a reevaluation of the law to ensure that it effectively protects children without infringing on the rights of innocent parents. The current legal framework not only jeopardizes the presumption of innocence but also places an undue burden on families who are simply trying to care for their children.

In light of these developments, it is clear that the Arizona state legislature must take a closer look at the language and implications of its laws. The potential for wrongful accusations and the erosion of parental rights cannot be overlooked. As the community grapples with these issues, the need for clarity and fairness in legislation has never been more pressing. The future of parenting in Arizona hangs in the balance as lawmakers face mounting pressure to address these critical concerns.",-12.0,-25.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,520.0,-1.25,-0.04807692307692308

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts with the possibility of Hillary Clinton assuming the presidency, speculation has arisen regarding the role of former First Lady Michelle Obama in a potential Clinton administration. While some may view this as a natural progression, others express discomfort with the idea of continuing to cover the Obamas in a political context.

Critics have raised questions about Michelle Obama’s legacy, particularly focusing on her initiatives during her time in the White House. One of the most notable programs she championed was the school lunch initiative, aimed at improving the nutritional quality of meals served to children. However, this program has faced scrutiny, with detractors arguing that it imposed unrealistic standards on schools and led to unintended consequences, such as increased food waste. Additionally, some of her public statements have drawn criticism, leading to a broader discussion about her qualifications for a potential role in a Clinton administration.

Hillary Clinton has long been an advocate for government involvement in child-rearing, a belief that aligns with her vision for a more engaged federal role in the lives of American families. This perspective raises important questions about the implications of such involvement, particularly in the realm of education and child upbringing. As Michelle Obama has committed to continuing her campaign for healthy living for children indefinitely, her alignment with Clinton’s views could suggest a partnership that emphasizes government-led initiatives in these areas.

However, the author expresses concern about the progressive influence on American education and child upbringing that could arise from such a partnership. The notion of government control over education is viewed as a dangerous concept, one that could undermine parental authority and individual choice. Critics argue that while initiatives aimed at improving child health and education are well-intentioned, they may inadvertently lead to an overreach of government power into the lives of families.

The prospect of Michelle Obama taking on a significant role in a Clinton administration raises further questions about the direction of policy and the potential for increased government intervention in personal and educational matters. As the conversation around education reform continues, the implications of a more progressive agenda could have lasting effects on how children are raised and educated in America.

In light of these concerns, the author reflects on the discomfort surrounding the idea of Michelle Obama remaining in the political spotlight. The Obamas have been a prominent fixture in American politics, and the prospect of their continued influence under a Clinton administration may not sit well with all segments of the population. As discussions about the future of education and child welfare unfold, it is essential to consider the balance between government involvement and parental rights.

As the political climate evolves, the potential for Michelle Obama to play a role in shaping policy under Hillary Clinton’s leadership remains a topic of debate. While her commitment to promoting healthy living for children is commendable, the broader implications of government control over education and child-rearing warrant careful consideration. The intersection of these issues will undoubtedly shape the discourse surrounding the future of American families and the role of government in their lives.

In conclusion, as speculation continues about Michelle Obama’s potential involvement in a Clinton administration, the conversation surrounding her legacy, qualifications, and the implications of progressive policies on education and child upbringing remains critical. The balance between government initiatives and individual freedoms will be a defining factor in the ongoing dialogue about the future of American society.",6.0,20.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,645.0,0.9090909090909091,0.031007751937984496

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

A new scandal has emerged involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), raising serious concerns about the distribution of ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This troubling development has sparked outrage and calls for accountability, particularly in light of the initiative's ties to Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, a company previously found guilty of serious misconduct.

Ranbaxy, which was penalized with a staggering $500 million fine in 2013 for fraud and introducing adulterated drugs into commerce, is at the center of this controversy. A draft congressional report has surfaced, suggesting that the distribution of these substandard drugs may have significantly increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these medications for their health and survival.

The report, initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, underscores the Clinton Foundation's relationship with Ranbaxy as a critical issue. It raises questions about the ethical implications of promoting a company with a documented history of poor quality control and fraudulent practices. The findings have ignited a firestorm of criticism directed at the Clinton Foundation, which has been accused of prioritizing financial gain over the well-being of individuals, particularly in the context of its charitable initiatives.

Dinesh Thakur, a former employee of Ranbaxy, has emerged as a key whistleblower in this scandal. His revelations led to a significant lawsuit against the company, shedding light on the extent of the alleged wrongdoing. Thakur's courage in coming forward has prompted further scrutiny of Ranbaxy's practices and the potential consequences for patients who may have received ineffective treatments.

The implications of this scandal are dire, with concerns mounting over the number of lives that may have been lost due to the distribution of these ineffective drugs. The draft congressional report suggests that the ramifications of using substandard medications could be catastrophic, particularly in regions where access to quality healthcare is already limited.

In 2007, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, a decision that has come under intense scrutiny in light of the current allegations. Critics are questioning the impact of these substandard medicines on patient health, particularly in a region where HIV/AIDS remains a significant public health challenge. The distribution of ineffective drugs could exacerbate the already dire situation, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates among vulnerable populations.

Despite being banned in the United States, Ranbaxy's generic drugs continue to be sold worldwide, raising further concerns about the safety and efficacy of medications available to patients in developing countries. The Clinton Foundation's ongoing ties to the company have drawn sharp criticism, with many questioning the integrity of its health initiatives and the motivations behind its partnerships.

The allegations against the Clinton Health Access Initiative and Ranbaxy have sparked a broader conversation about the responsibilities of charitable organizations in ensuring the safety and efficacy of the medications they promote. As the scandal unfolds, many are calling for greater transparency and accountability in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly when it comes to the health and well-being of patients in underserved regions.

The Clinton Foundation has long positioned itself as a champion of global health initiatives, but this scandal threatens to undermine its credibility and raise questions about its commitment to patient safety. Critics argue that the foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, despite evidence of its fraudulent practices, reflects a troubling prioritization of financial interests over the health of individuals in need.

As the congressional report continues to develop, the implications of this scandal are likely to reverberate throughout the healthcare community and beyond. The potential consequences for patients in sub-Saharan Africa, who rely on effective HIV/AIDS treatments, are particularly alarming. The distribution of substandard drugs could have far-reaching effects, not only on individual health outcomes but also on public health efforts aimed at combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

In light of these revelations, there is an urgent need for a thorough investigation into the practices of both the Clinton Health Access Initiative and Ranbaxy. Stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public, must demand accountability and ensure that the safety and efficacy of medications are prioritized above all else.

As this scandal continues to unfold, it serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in global health initiatives. The intersection of philanthropy, healthcare, and corporate interests can create a precarious landscape, where the well-being of patients may be compromised in the pursuit of financial gain. The ongoing scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation and its relationship with Ranbaxy will likely shape the future of health initiatives and the standards by which they are held accountable. 

In conclusion, the allegations surrounding the distribution of substandard HIV/AIDS drugs by the Clinton Health Access Initiative raise critical questions about the integrity of charitable organizations and their partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. As the investigation progresses, the health and safety of patients in sub-Saharan Africa must remain at the forefront of the conversation, ensuring that their needs are prioritized above all else.",-63.0,-48.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,922.0,-1.5483870967741935,-0.052060737527114966

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated the State Department to release documents related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her aides' completion of mandatory security training within a five-day timeframe. The decision comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which has been seeking transparency regarding the handling of classified materials by Clinton and her senior staff.

Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, ruled in favor of TheDCNF, rejecting the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. This ruling underscores the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Clinton's tenure at the State Department, particularly concerning the protocols for managing classified information.

The lawsuit specifically targets records pertaining to Clinton, her Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. TheDCNF has been pressing for documentation that would confirm whether Clinton and her aides completed the required security briefings on handling classified materials, a critical aspect of their roles in the government.

In his ruling, Judge Leon expressed clear frustration with the State Department's delays in producing the requested documents. He ordered the agency to release one-third of the approximately 400 documents by September 26, with the remainder due by October 10. This timeline reflects the judge's desire to expedite the process and ensure that the public has access to information that is deemed essential for understanding the security protocols followed by high-ranking officials.

Attorney Bradley Moss, who is involved in the case, commented on the ruling, stating that it highlights the judge's frustration with what he perceives as the State Department's obstruction of the FOIA process. Moss emphasized that the order serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in government operations, particularly when it comes to the handling of sensitive information.

The State Department's failure to produce the requested records has raised concerns about whether Clinton and her aides completed the necessary security training. In a notable admission, the agency indicated that their inability to provide documentation suggests that the required courses were not completed by Clinton or her senior staff. This revelation has further fueled the debate over the protocols in place for managing classified materials and the responsibilities of those in positions of power.

The implications of this ruling extend beyond the immediate case, as it raises broader questions about the accountability of government officials and the processes in place to ensure compliance with security regulations. The outcome of this lawsuit may set a precedent for future FOIA requests and the extent to which government agencies are required to disclose information related to the actions of public officials.

As the deadline for the release of documents approaches, attention will be focused on the State Department's compliance with the court's order. The public and media alike are eager to see the contents of the documents, which may shed light on the security training protocols that were in place during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

This ruling is part of a larger narrative surrounding the scrutiny of Clinton's use of a private email server during her time in office, a controversy that has persisted for years. The ongoing legal battles and investigations into her handling of classified information have kept the issue in the public eye, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency from government officials.

In conclusion, the federal judge's order for the State Department to release documents regarding Hillary Clinton and her aides' security training marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding government transparency and accountability. As the case unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor the State Department's response and the potential ramifications of the released documents on public perception and future policy regarding classified information management. The ruling serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to established protocols and the need for oversight in the handling of sensitive government information.",-5.0,0.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,735.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the first presidential debate approaches, the role of moderator Lester Holt has come under scrutiny, particularly regarding the absence of fact-checking during the event. Holt will lead the discussion between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but he will not be responsible for verifying the candidates' statements in real-time. This decision raises significant concerns about accountability, especially given Trump's history of making unverified claims.

The lack of on-screen fact-checking from major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, further complicates the debate landscape. With no immediate checks on the candidates' assertions, the responsibility to maintain honesty falls squarely on Holt's shoulders. This places an immense burden on the moderator, who must navigate the complexities of the debate while ensuring that the discourse remains fair and factual.

Trump's track record of dishonesty is alarming, with reports indicating that he has been documented to lie approximately every three-and-a-half minutes. This statistic underscores the urgent need for a robust fact-checking process during the debate. However, the media's reluctance to engage in real-time verification is often attributed to concerns over ratings and a desire to avoid confrontation with the controversial candidate.

Clinton's campaign has been vocal about the necessity for the moderator to challenge false statements made during the debate. They argue that without such interventions, the integrity of the debate is compromised, and voters may be misled by unchallenged claims. The expectation is that Clinton must perform exceptionally well to counteract any unverified assertions made by Trump, placing her in a position where she must exceed expectations to be perceived as successful.

This dynamic reflects a perceived double standard in the treatment of the two candidates. While Trump may make bold and unverified claims without immediate repercussions, Clinton is expected to navigate the debate with precision and clarity, all while addressing the potential misinformation that may arise. This disparity raises questions about fairness and the overall integrity of the electoral process.

The current state of journalism, particularly in the context of the election, is a cause for concern. The decision to forgo fact-checking during such a pivotal event highlights the challenges faced by the media in balancing the need for engaging content with the responsibility to inform the public accurately. As the debate looms, the implications of this approach will undoubtedly resonate beyond the stage, influencing public perception and the electoral landscape as a whole. 

In a time when the truth is often contested, the role of the moderator and the media's commitment to factual reporting are more critical than ever. The upcoming debate will serve as a litmus test for the effectiveness of these responsibilities in shaping the future of American politics.",-6.0,12.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,503.0,0.6,0.02385685884691849
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

In a striking revelation, Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has voiced serious concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In her recent statements, Kyle claims that Clinton is driven by ""anger and rage,"" which she believes could lead to a physical breakdown. This assertion raises questions about Clinton's overall health and her ability to handle the demands of the highest office in the land.

Kyle, who has known the Clintons for decades, goes further to assert that Clinton is experiencing cognitive impairment, suggesting that this could hinder her performance as a presidential candidate. She points to signs of emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty with tasks as indicators of Clinton's declining mental fitness. These claims are particularly alarming, as they come from someone who has been close to the Clinton family and may have unique insights into their personal dynamics.

In her book, ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" Kyle aims to shed light on what she describes as troubling aspects of Clinton's character and health. She emphasizes that Clinton's paranoia and controlling nature could be detrimental traits for someone seeking the presidency. Such characteristics, according to Kyle, could not only affect Clinton's decision-making but also her interactions with colleagues and constituents.

Kyle's portrayal of Clinton as ""addicted to power"" raises further concerns about the former Secretary of State's priorities. She suggests that Clinton is willing to jeopardize her health and the integrity of the Democratic Party in pursuit of her ambitions. This perspective adds a layer of complexity to the already challenging landscape of Clinton's public image, which has been marred by various health and character scandals over the years.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, these revelations from Kyle may pose additional challenges for Clinton as she seeks to maintain a positive public image. The implications of her claims could resonate with voters who are increasingly concerned about the health and stability of their leaders. 

In a time when the electorate is more discerning than ever, the questions raised by Kyle's comments could have significant ramifications for Clinton's campaign. As she navigates the turbulent waters of public perception, the scrutiny surrounding her fitness for office is likely to intensify, making it imperative for her to address these concerns head-on.",-13.0,-8.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,445.0,-0.5,-0.017977528089887642

NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE, NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC.

FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE.

FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In a continent often celebrated as a ""nation of immigrants"" and a ""melting pot,"" the conversation surrounding immigration is increasingly focused on the need for unity and integration. As communities across North America grapple with the complexities of cultural diversity, a growing sentiment emphasizes the importance of immigrants adapting to the customs and traditions of their new homes rather than maintaining separate programs that could foster division.

A recent statement from a Quebec mayor has reignited this debate, particularly regarding the integration of Muslim refugees into Canadian society. The mayor asserts that while Canada has a long-standing tradition of welcoming immigrants from various backgrounds, it is essential for newcomers to embrace Canadian culture and lifestyle. He argues that Canadians are neither racist nor xenophobic; rather, they are open to accepting individuals from diverse origins, provided that these individuals are willing to integrate into the fabric of Canadian life.

The mayor's comments reflect a broader concern that Canadian identity and culture should not be compromised in the name of multiculturalism. He emphasizes that while Canada is a nation built on diversity, the core values and traditions of the country must remain intact. This perspective raises questions about the balance between cultural preservation and the acceptance of new customs brought by immigrants.

Central to the mayor's argument is the belief that religion should remain a private matter, separate from public life. He insists that municipalities have the right to refuse concessions to Islam and Sharia law, reinforcing the idea that the legal and cultural frameworks of Canada should not be altered to accommodate specific religious practices. This stance has sparked discussions about the role of religion in public spaces and the extent to which it should influence local governance.

In a provocative suggestion, the mayor posits that Muslims who find themselves uncomfortable with Canadian culture should consider returning to one of the 57 Muslim-majority countries. This statement has drawn criticism from various quarters, with opponents arguing that it undermines the principles of inclusivity and acceptance that Canada prides itself on. However, supporters of the mayor's viewpoint contend that it is a call for accountability and a reminder that integration is a two-way street.

The frustration expressed in the mayor's remarks resonates with many who feel that some immigrants seek to impose their values and beliefs on others, rather than embracing the local culture. This sentiment is echoed in legislative actions taken in states like Texas, where lawmakers are actively working to prevent the implementation of Sharia law within the judicial system. Such measures reflect a growing concern about the potential for cultural encroachment and the desire to maintain a cohesive national identity.

As the dialogue surrounding immigration continues to evolve, the article advocates for a clear message: immigrants should either adopt the local culture or refrain from imposing their own. This call for unity underscores the belief that while diversity enriches society, it should not come at the expense of shared values and traditions.

In conclusion, the ongoing discussions about immigration in North America highlight the delicate balance between embracing diversity and ensuring cultural cohesion. As communities navigate these complex issues, the emphasis on integration and mutual respect remains paramount. The challenge lies in fostering an environment where all individuals, regardless of their background, can contribute to and thrive within a unified society.",12.0,12.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,619.0,0.5454545454545454,0.01938610662358643

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a recent incident in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by a group of Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through the area. The situation quickly escalated, creating a tense atmosphere that led onlookers, including a photographer, to fear for the man's safety, suspecting he might be mugged.

As the protesters gathered around the vehicle, the scene appeared increasingly hostile. Eyewitness accounts suggested that the man was in a precarious position, with the potential for confrontation looming. However, in a surprising turn of events, the protesters allowed the man to pass without any incident, defying the expectations of those observing the situation.

The dynamics shifted dramatically when the driver displayed a handgun out of his car window. This action prompted an immediate response from the protesters, who quickly dispersed from the vicinity. The sight of the firearm altered the course of the encounter, raising significant concerns about the implications of such a display in a charged environment.

This incident has sparked a broader conversation about the appropriate responses individuals should consider when faced with similar situations. Should one confront a group of protesters, or is it wiser to simply drive through? The dilemma highlights the complexities of navigating public demonstrations, particularly in a climate where tensions can run high.

As communities continue to grapple with issues surrounding race and justice, incidents like this serve as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of protests and the potential for misunderstandings. The actions of both the driver and the protesters raise important questions about safety, communication, and the responsibilities of individuals in public spaces.

While the man ultimately emerged from the encounter unscathed, the incident underscores the need for dialogue about how to engage with social movements and the potential consequences of armed displays in such contexts. As discussions around race and justice evolve, the lessons learned from this encounter may inform future interactions between individuals and protest groups.",-18.0,-14.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,370.0,-0.9333333333333333,-0.03783783783783784
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago's environmentalists are under fire for what critics describe as blatant hypocrisy regarding their support for development projects. The recent backing of the Obama Presidential Center by local environmental groups has raised eyebrows, especially given their previous opposition to George Lucas's proposed museum.

In a striking contrast, the same environmentalists who blocked Lucas's project—citing concerns over green space—are now expressing enthusiasm for the Obama center, which will necessitate the destruction of trees and grass in Jackson Park. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly voiced her excitement about the new center, a stance that many see as contradictory to the organization's charter aimed at preserving natural spaces.

Critics argue that this shift in support highlights a troubling pattern among leftist groups, who appear to champion environmental issues until they are personally affected. The proposed Lucas museum, which would have been constructed on a parking lot, was deemed unacceptable, while the Obama center's impact on existing green areas seems to be overlooked.

This situation has sparked discussions about a potential racial double standard in environmental decision-making. The contrasting treatment of the two projects raises questions about the motivations behind the environmentalists' actions and whether they are genuinely committed to their stated principles or simply responding to political pressures.

As the debate continues, the actions of Chicago's environmentalists serve as a reminder of the complexities and contradictions that often accompany urban development and environmental advocacy.

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

In a dramatic turn of events, General Stanley McChrystal, the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has resigned following a contentious meeting with President Barack Obama. The two leaders have had frequent disagreements regarding the conduct of the war, culminating in a tense confrontation in the Oval Office.

During the meeting, President Obama accused McChrystal of failing to provide the necessary political support. In a firm response, McChrystal clarified that his duty was to support Obama as Commander-in-Chief, not as a politician. This assertion led to McChrystal submitting his resignation, a move that many anticipated would mark the end of his Army career.

The relationship between Obama and military personnel has been fraught with tension, with the President reportedly harboring negative sentiments towards the military. As McChrystal resigned, Obama made a dismissive remark, suggesting that he would be happy to disrespect the general's grave, a comment that underscored the strained dynamics between the two.

In a final gesture of respect, McChrystal saluted the President and remarked that he would not stand in line again after leaving the Army, indicating his intention to wait his turn respectfully. This resignation not only highlights the ongoing challenges within military and political leadership but also raises questions about the future of US military strategy in Afghanistan under new command. 

As the nation reflects on this significant leadership change, the implications of McChrystal's departure will likely resonate throughout military and political circles for years to come.",7.0,-6.0,294.0,0.4666666666666667,0.023809523809523808,280.0,-0.6,-0.02142857142857143

Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm.

These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has recently witnessed a surge of unrest, with reports indicating that at least 70% of the rioters involved in the chaos were from out of state. This revelation has raised concerns about the nature of the protests and the motivations behind the violence that has erupted in the city.

Evidence suggests that the rioters possessed out-of-state identification, pointing to a well-organized operation rather than spontaneous civil unrest. The head of the local police union characterized these individuals as ""professional criminals,"" implying that their presence in Charlotte was not merely coincidental but rather part of a calculated effort to incite disorder.

The situation in Charlotte contrasts sharply with the protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where demonstrations have remained peaceful. Analysts speculate that the difference in the atmosphere may be attributed to a lack of sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement in the Tulsa area. This divergence highlights the varying responses to social justice movements across different regions of the country.

In Tulsa, the recent charging of a police officer involved in a shooting with manslaughter has seemingly diffused tensions, allowing for a more constructive dialogue between law enforcement and community members. This development stands in stark contrast to the escalating violence in Charlotte, where the presence of a significant Black Lives Matter faction has made the city more susceptible to riots.

The ongoing unrest in Charlotte has led to claims that outside radicals are being utilized to incite violence during protests. This assertion raises questions about the motivations behind the actions of these individuals and whether there is a broader agenda at play. Some observers suggest that the chaos is part of a larger strategy aimed at fostering unrest, potentially aligning with a communist agenda that seeks to instigate revolution and race wars.

As the situation continues to unfold, the implications of these out-of-state rioters and their impact on local communities remain a pressing concern. The involvement of individuals who are not part of the local fabric raises questions about the authenticity of the protests and the true goals of those participating in the violence.

The unrest in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding social justice movements in America. While many individuals are genuinely advocating for change and equality, the infiltration of outside elements seeking to exploit these movements for their own purposes complicates the narrative. The challenge for local communities is to discern between legitimate protest and the chaos instigated by those with ulterior motives.

As authorities work to address the violence and restore order, the focus will likely shift to understanding the dynamics at play in these protests. The presence of out-of-state rioters, described as ""professional criminals,"" raises significant concerns about the safety and security of local residents, as well as the integrity of the protests themselves.

In the coming days, community leaders and law enforcement will need to collaborate to ensure that the voices of those advocating for justice are not overshadowed by the actions of those seeking to create chaos. The path forward will require a concerted effort to address the underlying issues that have led to unrest while also safeguarding the community from external influences that threaten to derail the movement for change.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of the riots, the broader implications of these events will likely resonate across the nation, prompting discussions about the nature of protests, the role of outside actors, and the ongoing struggle for social justice in America.",-17.0,-45.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,638.0,-2.0454545454545454,-0.07053291536050156

He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:

The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”!

As the Presidential campaign heats up, Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a significant concern. Claims regarding her serious health issues, including potential neurological diseases, have gained considerable traction among the public and media alike. Following her collapse on September 11th, even her supportive media outlets can no longer overlook the implications of her health status.

Adding to the intrigue, expert Clif Hite has put forth a controversial theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and is currently being replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this theory would represent one of the most significant cover-ups in American political history.

Compounding the situation, reports indicate that Russian intelligence is leveraging video evidence to bolster claims that Clinton is utilizing doubles and has not been seen outside Chelsea's apartment. This narrative has raised eyebrows and fueled speculation about the authenticity of her public appearances.

Additionally, there are allegations surrounding a secret plane crash that purportedly injured Clinton. While some sources were initially skeptical of this report, many have since acknowledged its credibility, further complicating the narrative surrounding her health.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC.

In a political landscape increasingly defined by financial influence, the organization Common Defense PAC has emerged as a significant player in the campaign against former President Donald Trump. Identified as one of 187 groups funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, Common Defense PAC is actively targeting presidential candidates who oppose its values, particularly Trump.

Common Defense PAC positions itself as an advocate for the rights of all Americans, claiming to stand against Trump’s policies and rhetoric. The organization’s leadership page prominently features military veterans, suggesting a strong connection to the veteran community. However, critics have noted a lack of transparency, as the page does not provide contact information for these veterans, raising questions about the authenticity of their representation.

The PAC has made headlines for its aggressive anti-Trump messaging, sharing content that aligns with its mission to undermine the former president’s influence. In its efforts to amplify its message, Common Defense PAC collaborates with other organizations funded by Soros, creating a network of like-minded groups dedicated to opposing Trump. One of the notable campaigns associated with the PAC is the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which has gained traction and is also supported by the progressive organization MoveOn.org.

In a demonstration of its outreach capabilities, Common Defense PAC participated in a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump. This initiative successfully reached over 4.5 million people, showcasing the PAC’s ability to mobilize support and spread its anti-Trump message across social media platforms.

The collaboration between Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org extends beyond social media campaigns. The two organizations joined forces to organize a protest aimed at urging Senator John McCain to disavow Trump. This partnership highlights the strategic alliances that Common Defense PAC is forming to bolster its efforts against the former president.

Despite its ambitious goals, Common Defense PAC’s financial backing raises eyebrows. A review of the PAC’s July Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing reveals that it has only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This singular source of funding has led to skepticism regarding the PAC’s sustainability and its ability to represent a broad spectrum of veteran voices.

At the helm of Common Defense PAC is Director Perry O’Brien, a left-wing activist known for his conscientious objector status. O’Brien has a history of involvement with Iraq Veterans Against the War, which aligns with the PAC’s anti-Trump stance. However, his leadership has drawn criticism, particularly regarding the representation of veterans within the organization. Detractors argue that a single conscientious objector leading a PAC that claims to represent veterans is problematic and may not accurately reflect the diverse opinions within the veteran community.

As Common Defense PAC continues to navigate the political landscape, its alignment with Soros-funded initiatives and its focus on anti-Trump messaging will likely keep it in the spotlight. The organization’s ability to mobilize support and engage with the veteran community will be crucial as it seeks to influence the upcoming presidential election.

In conclusion, Common Defense PAC represents a growing trend of politically motivated organizations leveraging financial backing to shape electoral outcomes. With its focus on opposing Trump and its connections to other progressive groups, the PAC is poised to play a significant role in the political discourse leading up to the election. However, questions surrounding its leadership and representation of veterans may challenge its credibility and effectiveness in the long run. As the political landscape evolves, the impact of organizations like Common Defense PAC will be closely monitored by both supporters and critics alike.",8.0,28.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,673.0,1.0769230769230769,0.041604754829123326

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has brought to light a controversial decision made during the Obama administration, which allocated a staggering $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas. This story, originating in 2015, has resurfaced and continues to provoke significant outrage among various segments of the American public.

Critics of the funding argue that it not only supports Islamic terrorists but also raises serious concerns about U.S. foreign aid being funneled to groups that may have ties to terrorism. The allocation of such a substantial amount of taxpayer dollars has ignited a firestorm of debate, with many questioning the rationale behind using American funds to refurbish religious buildings abroad, especially when domestic economic challenges persist.

Taxpayer advocates have expressed their frustration over what they perceive as reckless spending. They describe the situation as akin to being on a ""gigantic credit card,"" where the U.S. government is accruing debt without a clear plan for repayment. This sentiment resonates with many Americans who are grappling with their own financial struggles, as reports indicate that one-third of the population is currently out of work. The allocation of funds for foreign mosque renovations has only intensified feelings of anger and betrayal among those who feel their tax dollars should be prioritized for domestic needs.

In defense of the funding, the State Department has stated that the financial support is part of broader efforts to combat Islamic extremism. Officials argue that by building relationships with Islamic leaders through these renovations, the U.S. can foster a more stable and peaceful environment in regions where extremism is prevalent. However, this justification has done little to quell the concerns of critics who remain skeptical about the effectiveness of such initiatives.

The controversy surrounding the mosque renovation funding is further compounded by the perception that it is part of a larger agenda to redistribute wealth to Islamic countries. Some commentators suggest that this funding is not merely an isolated incident but rather a strategic move to influence U.S. demographics through the resettlement of Muslim refugees. This perspective has fueled fears among certain groups that the U.S. is prioritizing foreign interests over the needs of its own citizens.

As the investigation continues to gain traction, the implications of the funding decision are becoming increasingly clear. Many Americans are questioning the priorities of their government, particularly in light of the economic hardships faced by a significant portion of the population. The allocation of such a large sum for the renovation of foreign religious buildings stands in stark contrast to the pressing needs of American citizens, leading to a growing sense of disillusionment with government spending practices.

The CBS investigation has reignited a debate that many thought had faded into the background. As more details emerge, it is likely that the conversation surrounding the funding of mosque renovations will continue to evolve, drawing in a wider audience of concerned citizens and policymakers alike. The intersection of foreign aid, domestic economic challenges, and national security concerns remains a contentious issue that will require careful consideration and dialogue in the months to come.

In conclusion, the revelation of the $770 million allocated for mosque renovations has sparked outrage and frustration among taxpayers and critics alike. As the nation grapples with economic difficulties and questions about the effectiveness of foreign aid, the implications of this funding decision will likely resonate for years to come. The ongoing discourse surrounding this issue highlights the need for transparency and accountability in government spending, particularly when it comes to the use of taxpayer dollars.",-13.0,-19.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,651.0,-0.8260869565217391,-0.029185867895545316
Fake_85-Webpage,BOOM! Marines Send TERRORISTS Scathing Message [VIDEO],"BOOM! Marines Send TERRORISTS Scathing Message [VIDEO]

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

In a bold response to the rising tide of terrorism, the United States Marine Corps has launched a nationwide billboard campaign aimed at countering the fear and intimidation tactics employed by ISIS and similar terrorist groups. These organizations thrive on propaganda, using threats of violence to instill fear in non-believers, whom they label as infidels. The Marines, however, are unbothered by being placed on terrorist hit lists and instead welcome the challenge, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to national security.

The billboards, strategically placed across the country, convey a powerful message: the Marines are prepared to confront terrorists head-on. This initiative comes at a crucial time, as the U.S. has witnessed a recent uptick in terrorist attacks, making the need for a strong, visible response more pressing than ever. The Marine Corps aims to reassure the public that they are ready and willing to protect American citizens from those who seek to do harm.

This campaign serves as a direct counter to the agenda of fear propagated by terrorist organizations. By showcasing their readiness to fight back, the Marines are not only asserting their strength but also undermining the power that these groups derive from instilling fear in the populace. The message is clear: fearlessness is a formidable weapon against terrorism.

While the billboard campaign has garnered support from many, it has also sparked controversy, particularly among liberal groups who have expressed anger over the initiative. Critics argue that the billboards may escalate tensions and prioritize a confrontational approach over dialogue. However, the article suggests that these critics may be prioritizing appeasement of terrorists over the fundamental right of American self-defense. The Marines’ stance is one of resilience, emphasizing that the safety and security of the nation must come first.

The billboards symbolize a broader commitment to fighting back against the threats posed by ISIS and other extremist groups. They serve as a reminder that the Marine Corps stands ready to protect the values and freedoms that Americans hold dear. In a world where fear can easily take hold, the Marines are determined to project strength and resolve.

As the campaign unfolds, the message resonates: the Marines are not just defenders; they are warriors prepared to confront the challenges posed by terrorism. In a powerful conclusion, the article declares, “Game over,” signaling a decisive stand against ISIS and a commitment to ensuring that fear does not dictate the narrative in America. The Marines are here, and they are ready to fight.",-53.0,-11.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,471.0,-0.5789473684210527,-0.02335456475583864

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is grappling with severe unrest as rioting has erupted across the city, leading to widespread looting and violence. The situation has escalated to a point where North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency, a move aimed at restoring order and ensuring the safety of residents. In response to the chaos, the National Guard has been deployed to assist local law enforcement in managing the situation.

The rioting has not only disrupted daily life in Charlotte but has also prompted officials to take a hard stance against those involved in the violence. In a significant announcement, state officials declared that individuals caught rioting or engaging in violent acts will face severe consequences, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This measure is intended to deter further unrest and hold individuals accountable for their actions.

Particularly concerning is the involvement of minor children in the riots. Officials have stated that minors caught participating in such activities will face similar repercussions, which will also extend to their parents. This means that parents of minors who are detained during the riots could lose state benefits, face referrals to social services, and potentially risk losing custody of their children. City official Wilson Stewart emphasized the importance of parental responsibility during a press conference, urging parents to take an active role in monitoring their children's activities.

The involvement of high school students in the riots has raised alarms among community leaders. Many of those detained are reported to be minors, prompting officials to call on parents to closely monitor their children's whereabouts. In an effort to curb the violence and restore peace, a mandatory curfew has been implemented across the city. This curfew is part of a broader strategy to encourage parental involvement and ensure that young people are not out in the streets during the unrest.

The announcement of these measures aims to send a clear message: the city will not tolerate violence or lawlessness. By holding both individuals and their families accountable, officials hope to deter future protests that could escalate into violence. The emphasis on parental responsibility highlights the belief that families play a crucial role in guiding the behavior of their children, especially during times of crisis.

As Charlotte continues to navigate this turbulent period, the community is urged to come together to restore peace and order. The deployment of the National Guard, the implementation of a curfew, and the strict consequences for those involved in the riots are all part of a concerted effort to bring stability back to the city. Officials are hopeful that these measures will not only address the immediate issues but also foster a sense of responsibility among families, ultimately leading to a safer environment for all residents.

In the coming days, the city will be closely monitoring the situation, and residents are encouraged to remain vigilant and cooperate with law enforcement. The hope is that through collective efforts, Charlotte can overcome this challenging chapter and emerge stronger.",-33.0,-12.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,562.0,-0.5454545454545454,-0.021352313167259787

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey is under increasing scrutiny and may be facing resignation as criticism mounts over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. The controversy intensified following revelations that Comey granted immunity to several of Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills. Reports indicate that Mills allegedly did not fully cooperate with the investigation, raising questions about the integrity of the inquiry.

The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28, where Comey will be called to account for his actions during the investigation. This hearing is expected to delve into the decisions made by Comey and the FBI, particularly regarding the controversial immunity deals that have drawn ire from various political factions.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has been vocal in his criticism of Comey, calling for his resignation and questioning his fitness for office. DiGenova has characterized the investigation as inadequate, suggesting that it resembled a ""protected investigation"" rather than a thorough and impartial inquiry. His comments reflect a growing sentiment among some lawmakers and legal experts who believe that the investigation did not meet the standards of accountability expected from the FBI.

As Congress continues to hold hearings to investigate the handling of the email scandal, Comey is under pressure to provide clarity on his decisions. He has been issued a subpoena by Congress to deliver documents related to the investigation, which he has previously failed to provide. This lack of compliance has further fueled criticism and raised concerns about transparency within the FBI.

The implications of Comey's actions extend beyond the immediate investigation, as questions about his loyalty to Clinton have surfaced. Critics argue that his decisions may have been influenced by political considerations, potentially undermining the credibility of the FBI. The ongoing scrutiny of Comey’s conduct has led to speculation about how these developments could impact his career and the future of the FBI.

As the September 28 hearing approaches, the pressure on Comey is mounting. Lawmakers are eager to understand the rationale behind his decisions, particularly the controversial immunity grants that have become a focal point of the investigation. The outcome of this hearing could have significant ramifications not only for Comey but also for the public's trust in the FBI's ability to conduct impartial investigations.

In a political climate already fraught with tension, the fallout from the Clinton email investigation continues to reverberate. With Comey at the center of this storm, the coming weeks will be critical in determining his fate and the future direction of the FBI.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has come under intense scrutiny for its alleged support of terrorism and its record on human rights. As a significant donor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, the kingdom's actions have raised serious questions about the implications of such financial support, particularly in light of the troubling history surrounding the majority of the 9/11 terrorists, who were from Saudi Arabia. This connection has sparked a broader debate about the United States' ongoing support for the nation, especially given its controversial practices.

Reports have surfaced indicating that Saudi Arabia is involved in the auctioning of sex slaves, a practice that has drawn widespread condemnation. These auctions reportedly include women from Iraq, Syria, and even Western countries, highlighting a disturbing trend where individuals from various nationalities are complicit in the buying and selling of human beings. The Islamic State, known for its brutal tactics, has a notorious history of trafficking and abusing sex slaves, particularly targeting vulnerable groups such as Yazidi girls and non-Muslim women. This exploitation raises urgent ethical questions about the international community's response to such atrocities.

The plight of women rescued from ISIS is particularly alarming. Instead of being granted the freedom and support they desperately need, many are reportedly being sold into further exploitation. This cycle of abuse underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of human trafficking and to provide adequate resources for survivors. The international community must take a stand against these practices and hold accountable those who perpetuate them.

In light of these revelations, there is a growing call for an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Critics argue that continued military support only serves to enable the kingdom's questionable actions and complicity in human rights violations. Politicians are urged to distance themselves from Saudi Arabia, recognizing that financial ties should not overshadow the moral imperative to protect human rights and uphold international law.

The complicity of U.S. leadership in these issues cannot be overlooked. The relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia has long been characterized by a complex interplay of strategic interests and ethical considerations. However, as evidence mounts regarding the kingdom's involvement in terrorism and human rights abuses, it is imperative for U.S. leaders to reassess their alliances and prioritize the values of justice and human dignity.

Hillary Clinton's associations with Saudi Arabia have drawn particular criticism, as her campaign received substantial donations from the kingdom. This financial support raises questions about the potential influence of foreign interests on domestic politics and policy decisions. Critics argue that such ties may compromise the integrity of political leaders and their commitment to addressing human rights abuses.

As the world grapples with the implications of these revelations, it is essential for citizens and leaders alike to advocate for change. The auctioning of sex slaves and the ongoing exploitation of vulnerable individuals must be met with a unified response that prioritizes human rights and accountability. The international community has a responsibility to stand against such practices and to support efforts aimed at eradicating human trafficking.

In conclusion, the troubling ties between Saudi Arabia and the United States necessitate a critical examination of the implications of financial support and political alliances. As the evidence of human rights abuses and complicity in terrorism continues to mount, it is crucial for leaders to take a stand against these injustices. The call for an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia and a reevaluation of political associations is not just a matter of policy; it is a moral imperative that demands immediate attention and action. The time for change is now, and the world must unite to protect the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of nationality or circumstance.",-30.0,-10.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,698.0,-0.37037037037037035,-0.014326647564469915
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle unfolded with intense exchanges between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump. The event, moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt, was characterized by a series of contentious moments that highlighted the stark differences between the two candidates.

As the debate progressed, Holt faced criticism for his approach, particularly for interrupting Trump to ""fact-check"" him. Critics argued that Holt's interventions were often inaccurate and seemed to favor Clinton. One of the most heated exchanges occurred when Holt pressed Trump on his past support for the Iraq War, a claim Trump vehemently denied. This moment underscored the tension in the debate, as Holt did not extend similar scrutiny to Clinton regarding her own vote in favor of the war, instead focusing solely on Trump’s previous statements.

Following the debate, an interview with Fox News' Neil Cavuto revealed that Trump had reservations about the invasion of Iraq. In the interview, Trump expressed uncertainty about the decision to invade, suggesting that more deliberation and consideration of the United Nations' stance were necessary before taking such significant military action. This revelation added another layer to the debate, as it contrasted with Holt's insistence on Trump's supposed support for the war.

The aftermath of the debate sparked discussions about the role of the mainstream media in shaping the narrative around the candidates. Critics pointed out that rather than facilitating a substantive debate, the media appeared to be focused on discrediting Trump. This sentiment resonated with many of Trump's supporters, who felt that the media's treatment of him was unfair and biased.

Throughout the debate, Trump was noted for standing his ground against both Clinton and the media. His assertive demeanor and refusal to back down from contentious topics showcased his determination to challenge the status quo. As the debate concluded, it was clear that both candidates had made their marks, but the dynamics of the media's involvement and the focus on Trump's past statements would continue to be a point of contention in the days to come.

As the election season heats up, the implications of this debate will likely reverberate through the campaign trail, influencing voter perceptions and media coverage alike. The first debate set the stage for a contentious race, with both candidates poised to defend their positions in the face of scrutiny from each other and the media.",-9.0,-15.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,461.0,-0.8823529411764706,-0.03253796095444685
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

The Birther movement, which gained traction during Barack Obama's presidency, has sparked intense debate regarding its implications and whether it reflects an underlying bias against the former president. Central to this discussion are claims about Obama's birthplace and citizenship, which have been scrutinized since his rise in politics.

A notable reference point in this discourse is a 2004 article published by Breitbart, which controversially stated, ""Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate."" This article emerged during a pivotal moment in Obama's political career, as he gained momentum in the Illinois Senate race following the withdrawal of his rival, Jack Ryan. The timing of this assertion raises questions about the motivations behind such claims and their potential impact on public perception.

Interestingly, Obama never publicly refuted the assertions made in the 2004 Breitbart article, leaving room for speculation about the authenticity of his birthplace. Further complicating the narrative is a 1991 promotional booklet from Obama’s literary agency, which described him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” This booklet was circulated among publishing industry colleagues and included biographies of various authors, including Obama.

The existence of this booklet has led to renewed scrutiny of Obama's narrative regarding his origins. Critics argue that if Obama’s American birth is indeed valid, then the claims made in the 1991 booklet could be interpreted as deceptive, potentially for personal gain. This contradiction raises significant questions about the integrity of his biography and the motivations behind the information presented to the public.

The implications of these conflicting narratives are profound, particularly in the context of Obama's eligibility for the presidency. If one claim is proven to be false, it casts doubt on the veracity of the other. This dilemma not only fuels the Birther movement but also highlights the broader issues of race, identity, and political bias that have permeated discussions about Obama since he first entered the national spotlight.

As the Birther movement continues to evoke strong reactions, it serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding political narratives and the potential for bias in the interpretation of a leader's identity. The questions raised by the movement remain relevant, prompting ongoing discussions about the intersection of race, politics, and the authenticity of personal narratives in the public sphere. The legacy of these debates will likely endure, shaping perceptions of Obama and the political landscape for years to come.",-18.0,-7.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,463.0,-0.4375,-0.01511879049676026

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In a recent debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showcased an unusually prepared demeanor, captivating audiences with her performance. Notably, she refrained from coughing or reaching for water, a stark contrast to previous public appearances that had drawn attention for her frequent throat-clearing and hydration breaks. However, her polished presentation was not the only topic of discussion following the event.

Social media users quickly turned their attention to a possible flesh-colored device that appeared in Clinton's ear during the debate. This sparked a flurry of speculation regarding the nature of the device, with many suggesting it could be an earpiece. Theories ranged from it being a simple trick of light to a fashionable accessory, or even a ""Cough prevention machine,"" as some humorously posited.

In response to the growing chatter, Clinton's campaign swiftly denied the earpiece claims. They attributed the appearance of the device to reflections caused by the bright television lights used during the broadcast. This explanation, however, did little to quell the curiosity surrounding the incident.

Adding fuel to the fire, a leaked email from Clinton to her longtime aide Huma Abedin surfaced, in which she mentioned an earpiece. This revelation raised further questions about the authenticity of the campaign's denial and whether Clinton had indeed used an earpiece during the debate. The email's contents have led to increased scrutiny and speculation among political commentators and the public alike.

Commentator Woods humorously weighed in on the situation, suggesting that Clinton might require assistance to effectively deliver her messages, implying that an earpiece could serve as a tool for guidance. This lighthearted jab at Clinton's performance only added to the ongoing debate about the implications of the device's presence.

Despite the swirling rumors, there remains no definitive proof that the device was an earpiece. Some observers have speculated that it could have been a hearing aid or merely a reflection from the stage lights. The ambiguity surrounding the device has left many wondering about the true nature of Clinton's debate preparation and whether any external assistance was involved.

As the debate continues, the incident highlights the intense scrutiny that public figures face, particularly during high-stakes events like debates. The intersection of technology and politics has never been more pronounced, with the potential for devices to influence public perception and performance.

In conclusion, while Clinton's debate performance was marked by a notable absence of her previous coughing fits, the appearance of the device in her ear has sparked a myriad of theories and discussions. Whether it was a simple reflection, a fashion statement, or something more, the incident serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges that accompany public life in the digital age. As the narrative unfolds, it remains to be seen how this controversy will impact Clinton's campaign and public perception moving forward.",-5.0,7.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,539.0,0.3181818181818182,0.012987012987012988
