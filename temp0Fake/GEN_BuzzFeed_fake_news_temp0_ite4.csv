Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

In a recent statement, former President Bill Clinton has found himself at the center of a media storm following his remarks about donors to the Clinton Foundation seeking favors. The comments have generated negative headlines, with many interpreting them as a nod to a pay-to-play scenario, a narrative that aligns closely with accusations made by former President Donald Trump.

During an interview with NPR, Clinton sought to clarify his position, stating that while it is true that individuals may approach the foundation with requests for favors, it does not imply that those requests are granted. This distinction, however, has not quelled the backlash, as critics have seized upon the implications of his words to suggest a troubling connection between the foundation's donors and political influence.

The controversy has been further fueled by leaked emails that suggest some donors to the Clinton Foundation were granted meetings with Clinton and other high-profile figures. While these revelations have raised eyebrows, they have not provided concrete evidence of a pay-to-play arrangement, a term that has become synonymous with allegations of corruption in political fundraising. Clinton's defenders argue that the foundation's work in global health and development should not be overshadowed by these insinuations.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump's own charitable foundation has come under scrutiny for its practices. Reports indicate that Trump has not personally donated to his foundation since 2008, raising questions about the authenticity of his philanthropic efforts. Furthermore, allegations have surfaced that Trump used funds from his charitable foundation for personal purchases, prompting an investigation led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. This investigation has cast a shadow over Trump's charitable activities, highlighting a potential misuse of funds that could undermine his credibility as a philanthropist.

The media landscape has played a significant role in shaping public perception of both Clinton and Trump. Media Matters, a progressive research organization, has pointed out a perceived double standard in the coverage of the two figures. According to their analysis, recent media reports have focused on relatively minor issues concerning Clinton while neglecting more significant revelations about Trump's foundation. This disparity in coverage has the potential to impact Clinton's campaign negatively, as voters may be swayed by the narrative that emphasizes her alleged missteps over Trump's more serious ethical concerns.

As the 2024 election cycle approaches, the implications of these controversies are likely to resonate with voters. Clinton's comments about foundation donors seeking favors may serve as fodder for her opponents, who are eager to paint her as part of a corrupt political establishment. Meanwhile, Trump's ongoing legal challenges related to his charitable foundation could complicate his efforts to position himself as a champion of the people.

The interplay between these two narratives underscores the complexities of modern political campaigning, where perceptions can be shaped by media coverage and public discourse. As both candidates navigate these turbulent waters, the stakes are high, and the potential for missteps looms large.

In the coming weeks, it will be crucial for both Clinton and Trump to address these issues head-on. For Clinton, reinforcing the positive impact of the Clinton Foundation and clarifying the nature of donor interactions may help mitigate the fallout from her recent comments. For Trump, demonstrating a commitment to ethical fundraising practices and transparency could bolster his standing among voters who are increasingly wary of political corruption.

Ultimately, the ongoing scrutiny of both candidates' charitable foundations serves as a reminder of the importance of accountability in political fundraising. As voters prepare to make their choices in the upcoming election, the narratives surrounding Clinton and Trump will undoubtedly continue to evolve, shaped by new revelations and the ever-watchful eye of the media.",6.0,7.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,691.0,0.28,0.010130246020260492
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, alleging that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially exacerbating morbidity and mortality risks among patients. The report, titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, and it scrutinizes the implications of these claims for the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives.

CHAI, widely recognized as one of the Clinton Foundation's most significant efforts, was established to assist individuals affected by HIV/AIDS, particularly in regions where access to effective treatment is limited. However, the report raises serious questions about the quality of the drugs distributed under its auspices, particularly those sourced from Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, a key distributor for CHAI.

The relationship between Bill Clinton and Ranbaxy has come under intense scrutiny, especially following revelations from Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower and former Ranbaxy employee. Thakur played a pivotal role in exposing the company's practices, which ultimately led to a landmark lawsuit against Ranbaxy. In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to multiple criminal counts related to fraud and the distribution of adulterated drugs, resulting in a hefty $500 million fine. The Department of Justice indicated that the diluted drugs produced by Ranbaxy posed increased health risks to patients, raising alarms about the efficacy of the treatments provided to those in need.

Rep. Blackburn's report questions the extent of harm caused by the distribution of these substandard drugs and its broader implications for the Clinton Foundation. The report highlights the ties between Bill Clinton and several controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It emphasizes Ranbaxy's poor quality control and fraudulent reporting practices to the FDA, which have raised significant concerns about the safety of the drugs distributed through CHAI.

While the exact number of AIDS patients affected by the diluted drugs remains unclear, the implications of these findings are profound. ProPublica reported that in 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated substantial funds to Ranbaxy, further entrenching the company's role in the distribution of HIV/AIDS medications. Thakur has noted that the efficacy of anti-retroviral drugs is severely compromised if the actual content of the medication does not match what is stated on the label, a concern that has been echoed by health advocates and experts alike.

The issues surrounding Ranbaxy's drugs were first reported in 2004, with the FDA issuing a warning letter in 2006 regarding significant quality control irregularities. Despite these warnings and the eventual ban on Ranbaxy's generic drugs in the U.S., CHAI and Bill Clinton continued to support the company, raising questions about the decision-making processes within the initiative.

Thakur has expressed frustration over his attempts to communicate his concerns regarding Ranbaxy's practices to CHAI and the Clinton Foundation. His efforts to alert the organization about the potential dangers of the drugs went largely unheeded, leading to further scrutiny of the foundation's oversight mechanisms.

In 2010, CHAI became a separate entity from the Clinton Foundation, yet it maintains close ties with overlapping board members and staff. This relationship has led to questions about the governance and accountability of CHAI, particularly in light of the allegations presented in Blackburn's report. The report suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards for drug distribution through a 2000 executive order, which could have facilitated the distribution of substandard medications.

CHAI began distributing generic HIV drugs from multiple foreign manufacturers, including Ranbaxy, in 2003. The report also explores potential corruption and financial benefits to the Clinton Foundation stemming from partnerships with drug manufacturers. Blackburn criticized the ""false hopes"" provided by the Clinton Foundation to patients and healthcare workers, suggesting that the initiative's actions may have inadvertently contributed to the suffering of those it aimed to help.

As the report continues to circulate, it raises critical questions about the ethical responsibilities of organizations like CHAI and the Clinton Foundation in ensuring the safety and efficacy of the medications they distribute. The implications of these findings could have far-reaching consequences for public trust in health initiatives and the accountability of philanthropic organizations.

In light of these allegations, the Clinton Foundation has yet to respond publicly to the report. However, the scrutiny surrounding CHAI and its practices is likely to intensify as lawmakers and health advocates call for greater transparency and accountability in the distribution of life-saving medications. The ongoing investigation into the practices of Ranbaxy and the implications for patients in sub-Saharan Africa underscore the urgent need for vigilance in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly when it comes to the health and well-being of vulnerable populations.

As the debate continues, the focus remains on the potential ramifications for the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives, as well as the broader implications for global health efforts aimed at combating HIV/AIDS. The findings of the draft congressional report serve as a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges faced by organizations working to provide essential healthcare services in resource-limited settings. The need for rigorous oversight and accountability in the distribution of medications has never been more critical, as the health of millions hangs in the balance. 

In conclusion, the draft congressional report initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn raises significant concerns about the practices of the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its relationship with Ranbaxy. The allegations of distributing diluted HIV/AIDS drugs have the potential to impact the lives of countless patients in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the importance of quality control and ethical standards in healthcare initiatives. As the investigation unfolds, the implications for the Clinton Foundation and its legacy in global health remain to be seen, but the call for accountability and transparency is louder than ever.",-6.0,-9.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1070.0,-0.2571428571428571,-0.008411214953271028
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. This incident has ignited a wave of speculation regarding her health and the implications for her public appearances as the election season heats up.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her demeanor. Witnesses described her as appearing more energetic and lighter, but it was her physical appearance that raised eyebrows. Many noted a significant change in her nose, leading to speculation that she may have undergone rhinoplasty. The altered nose was characterized as Roman, contrasting sharply with the Nordic nose that has been a hallmark of the real Hillary Clinton.

Further fueling the speculation, the stand-in for Clinton appeared noticeably younger and lacked a distinctive mole above the right lip that the real Hillary has long been known for. This has led to questions about whether the individual seen in public is indeed the former First Lady or a clone, a theory that has gained traction among some observers.

As the election approaches, concerns are mounting about Clinton's ability to participate in upcoming debates, particularly against her opponent, Donald Trump. The possibility that a clone may handle most public appearances has raised eyebrows and prompted discussions about the implications for transparency in leadership. Observers are being advised to look for signs of the clone, such as a thinner, younger appearance or an absence of the health issues that have plagued the real Hillary Clinton.

The speculation surrounding Clinton's health and the potential use of a clone has led to broader questions about her role in a potential presidency. If elected, there are concerns that the clone may conduct all public appearances and make decisions, relegating Hillary to a figurehead position. This scenario raises significant questions about the authenticity of leadership and the extent to which voters are being presented with a genuine candidate.

The situation has drawn comparisons to previous speculation surrounding President Obama, where questions about transparency and authenticity were similarly raised. The implications of such a scenario extend beyond Clinton herself, touching on the very nature of political representation and the trust voters place in their leaders.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the focus on Hillary Clinton's health and the potential for a clone to take over her public duties remains a topic of intense discussion. The views expressed in this article reflect the author's perspective and do not necessarily align with the opinions of EagleRising.com.

In a time when transparency and authenticity are paramount in politics, the unfolding situation surrounding Hillary Clinton serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges that come with public life. As the election draws nearer, the public will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how this narrative develops and what it means for the future of political leadership in America.",8.0,12.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,551.0,0.6,0.021778584392014518
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In the lead-up to the upcoming election, former President Donald Trump has reignited a contentious debate surrounding immigration and terrorism with a series of provocative statements. His remarks have drawn sharp criticism and raised concerns about the implications of his proposed policies, particularly regarding the treatment of Muslim communities in the United States.

One of Trump's most controversial proposals is the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he argues is necessary to keep out immigrants he has labeled as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" This rhetoric has not only polarized public opinion but has also been criticized for its dehumanizing portrayal of immigrants. Critics argue that such language fosters a climate of fear and hostility towards those seeking refuge or a better life in America.

In addition to his views on immigration, Trump has suggested the creation of a national registry for Muslims, a proposal that has drawn comparisons to historical actions taken against Jews in Nazi Germany. This alarming analogy has raised significant ethical concerns, with many arguing that it undermines the principles of equality and freedom that the United States stands for. The implications of such a registry could be profound, potentially leading to increased discrimination and surveillance of Muslim communities across the nation.

Trump's approach to combating terrorism has also been marked by extreme rhetoric. He has advocated for measures that include the idea of killing the families of terrorists, a stance that has been met with widespread condemnation. Critics argue that such actions would not only be morally reprehensible but could also violate international law and human rights standards.

In a recent statement, Trump's Senior Communications Advisor emphasized that the former president is focused on combating the ""narratives"" of his political opponents, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, rather than addressing the root causes of terrorism itself. This focus on political narratives rather than substantive policy solutions raises questions about the effectiveness of Trump's proposed strategies in dealing with the complex issue of terrorism.

Trump has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the Obama administration, claiming that it has allowed immigrants from dangerous countries to gain U.S. citizenship and has increased the number of Syrian refugees entering the country. He asserts that the threat of radical Islamic terrorism has grown under the leadership of Obama and Clinton, arguing that they do not instill fear in enemies like ISIS. This narrative plays into a broader theme of fear-mongering that has characterized Trump's campaign, as he seeks to position himself as a strongman capable of restoring safety and security.

Moreover, Trump has expressed a belief that Muslims should take on a collective responsibility to report suspicious individuals within their communities. This suggestion raises significant concerns about the potential for stigmatization and mistrust among different communities. Critics warn that such a stance could lead to a chilling effect, where individuals may feel pressured to act against their own community members, further exacerbating divisions and tensions.

The recent attacks in New York and New Jersey, which were committed by an American citizen, highlight the complexity of the issue of terrorism. These incidents serve as a reminder that the threat of violence can emerge from within, challenging the simplistic narratives that often dominate discussions about immigration and terrorism. The focus on foreign-born individuals as the primary threat can obscure the reality that domestic radicalization is a significant concern that requires a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.

As Trump continues to make headlines with his incendiary remarks, there are growing concerns about how his rhetoric could translate into policy if he were to assume office again. The potential consequences for Muslims in America, as well as for the broader fabric of American society, could be severe. Critics warn that Trump's approach could lead to increased discrimination, surveillance, and violence against marginalized communities, undermining the values of tolerance and inclusivity that many Americans hold dear.

In light of these developments, there is a call to action for voters to participate in the upcoming election. Many advocates argue that it is crucial to prevent Trump from winning, as his presidency could have lasting implications for civil rights and social cohesion in the United States. The stakes are high, and the upcoming election presents an opportunity for citizens to voice their concerns and make their choices known.

As the nation grapples with these pressing issues, the discourse surrounding immigration and terrorism remains fraught with tension.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, promoting the concept of One World Government and globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Allegations of pay-to-play corruption have emerged surrounding Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the integrity of the foundation's operations. The Clinton campaign has initially responded to these allegations by emphasizing the charitable work of the foundation, which has been a focal point of its public image.

However, critics argue that the Clinton Foundation has primarily functioned as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates rather than a genuine charitable organization. This perspective is bolstered by financial data that reveals troubling trends in the foundation's spending practices.

In 2014, the Clinton Foundation allocated a mere 5.7% of its budget to charitable grants, according to IRS filings. This figure has raised eyebrows among watchdog groups and critics alike, who question the foundation's commitment to its stated mission of philanthropy. The foundation's total spending for that year was nearly $91.3 million, yet less than $5.2 million was directed toward charitable causes.

A significant portion of the foundation's budget was consumed by salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, which totaled $34.8 million. Additionally, the foundation reported $50.4 million in ""other expenses,"" further complicating the narrative of a charity focused on altruism. Notably, charitable spending saw a dramatic decrease of 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite the foundation receiving an additional $30 million in revenue.

The increase in salaries and other expenses, which rose by $5 million in 2014, has led to further scrutiny of the foundation's financial priorities. Critics contend that these figures suggest a misalignment between the foundation's purported mission and its actual financial practices.

The implications of these findings are significant, as they suggest that the Clinton Foundation may have been primarily a means for the Clintons to generate wealth. Allegations have surfaced that Hillary Clinton leveraged her position as Secretary of State for financial gain, raising ethical concerns about the intersection of politics and personal profit.

As the debate continues, the Clinton Foundation remains under the microscope, with calls for greater transparency and accountability. The allegations of pay-to-play corruption have sparked a broader conversation about the role of charitable organizations in political life and the potential for conflicts of interest. The foundation's future and its impact on the Clintons' legacy hang in the balance as these discussions unfold.",25.0,5.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,442.0,0.29411764705882354,0.011312217194570135
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

The former Secretary of State had been seen convulsing and was assisted into her van at the memorial, prompting her campaign to initially attribute the episode to the heat. However, it was later revealed that the temperature in New York City that day was a mild 74 degrees, raising eyebrows about the explanation.

Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment, passing multiple hospitals en route, which led to further speculation regarding her health. Critics questioned whether her appearance at the rally was a genuine recovery or a staged event designed to project an image of wellness.

The rally itself has come under scrutiny, particularly due to a video that sparked suspicions about the authenticity of the audience. Viewers noted the presence of cameras directed at attendees, leading to theories that the event may have been orchestrated. Additional videos emerged, providing analysis that suggested the rally could have been faked. However, a C-Span video was referenced to confirm that the previous videos were not doctored, adding another layer to the ongoing debate surrounding Clinton's health and the nature of her public appearances.",4.0,-1.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,241.0,-0.1111111111111111,-0.004149377593360996
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the fictional movie ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" gears up for its release, it has sparked a wave of discussions surrounding the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the media's portrayal of her condition. The film, which is expected to blend humor with serious undertones, reflects a growing concern among some observers regarding the transparency of Clinton's health issues and the media's role in shaping public perception.

Critics have long pointed to what they perceive as an unwavering support from the media for Clinton, suggesting that this allegiance may lead to a downplaying of serious health concerns. This sentiment has been echoed by various commentators who argue that the media's protective stance could obscure the truth about Clinton's health, potentially leaving the public in the dark about critical issues that could affect her fitness for office.

Allegations have surfaced claiming that Clinton is severely ill, with detractors dismissing her health issues as mere ""conspiracy theories."" This narrative has gained traction among certain factions, who assert that the severity of her condition is being intentionally minimized. The presence of a traveling physician and a so-called ""mystery man"" during Clinton's medical emergencies since 2003 has only fueled speculation about the true state of her health. These figures have been described as shadowy presences, raising questions about the extent of medical support Clinton has received and the implications for her public life.

Speculation surrounding Clinton's health has intensified, with some suggesting that she may be suffering from seizures and possibly Parkinson's disease. Observers have pointed to her symptoms and medical history as evidence supporting these claims. The discourse around her health has become increasingly charged, with accusations of dishonesty regarding her condition reinforcing public distrust in her ability to serve effectively as president. This skepticism has been compounded by her declining poll numbers, which have been exacerbated by her controversial remarks about Trump supporters, further alienating segments of the electorate.

In addition to concerns about her health, critics have highlighted perceived hypocrisy in Clinton's statements regarding racism. Many have drawn attention to her past associations and actions, suggesting that her current rhetoric may not align with her history. This dissonance has led to a broader conversation about the authenticity of her political persona and the implications for her future in public life.

Despite the political disagreements that many may have with Clinton, there is a palpable sense of mixed feelings regarding her health struggles. While some may relish in the political ramifications of her condition, there remains a thread of compassion for her as a person. The acknowledgment of her health challenges evokes a sense of empathy, transcending partisan divides and reminding observers that behind the political facade lies a human being grappling with significant issues.

As speculation mounts about the future of Clinton's political career, there is a growing sentiment that it may be nearing its end. While some hope for her well-being in her private life, the reality of her health struggles casts a long shadow over her potential return to the political arena. The complexities of her situation serve as a reminder of the intricate interplay between health, media portrayal, and public perception in the realm of politics.

In conclusion, the anticipation surrounding ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" serves as a catalyst for broader discussions about Hillary Clinton's health and the media's role in shaping narratives. As the film approaches its release, it is clear that the conversation surrounding Clinton's health will continue to evolve, reflecting the ongoing complexities of her public life and the challenges she faces in the political landscape.

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant final address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama expressed deep concerns about the ongoing struggle against ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. His remarks underscored a growing skepticism regarding the effectiveness of U.S. military power in addressing these threats, which he controversially labeled as a ""JV team."" This characterization reflects a broader critique of the U.S. approach to combating radical extremism, suggesting that the current strategies may be insufficient to confront the complexities of modern warfare.

Obama articulated a stark reality: the United States, often viewed as a global police force, faces significant challenges in winning the battle against these militants. He pointed to the alarming expansion of the Islamic State and the absence of a viable military solution to counteract its influence. This acknowledgment of the limitations of military intervention marks a significant shift in the narrative surrounding U.S. foreign policy, particularly in the context of the Middle East.

In his address, Obama emphasized the necessity for honesty about the nature of these conflicts. He argued that a clear-eyed understanding of the situation is crucial for developing effective strategies moving forward. The former president highlighted the importance of diplomacy, advocating for a multifaceted approach that prioritizes stopping violence, delivering humanitarian aid, and supporting political settlements. This perspective reflects a growing recognition that military might alone cannot resolve the deep-rooted issues fueling extremism.

However, the address also sparked criticism of the liberal viewpoint that tends to downplay the connection between radical Islam and violence. Detractors argue that such a stance risks ignoring the real threats posed by extremist ideologies, which have contributed to the current predicament faced by the international community. The failure to confront these ideologies head-on is seen as a significant oversight that could have dire consequences for global security.

The author of the critique calls for decisive action against radical Islam, rejecting any defeatist attitudes that may hinder progress. This call to action emphasizes the need for a robust response to the challenges posed by extremist groups, advocating for a strategy that combines military, diplomatic, and humanitarian efforts. The urgency of the situation demands a comprehensive approach that acknowledges the complexities of the conflict while remaining steadfast in the commitment to combat radicalism.

As Obama concluded his address, the weight of his words lingered in the air, serving as a reminder of the multifaceted nature of the fight against extremism. The challenges ahead are daunting, but the former president's emphasis on honesty, diplomacy, and a commitment to addressing the root causes of violence offers a potential pathway forward. In a world increasingly defined by conflict and division, the call for a balanced and realistic approach to combating radicalism resonates more than ever. The future of global security may depend on the willingness to confront these issues with clarity and resolve.",-5.0,-13.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,537.0,-0.65,-0.024208566108007448
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have shed light on the U.S. intelligence community's awareness of the rise of ISIS and the potential establishment of a caliphate as early as 2012. The documents, which include insights from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), suggest that the Obama Administration may have inadvertently created conditions that allowed ISIS to isolate the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad.

Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed has highlighted that the documents predict that support from Western nations, Turkey, and Gulf states for Takfiri militants would lead to the formation of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. This assertion raises questions about the strategic decisions made by the U.S. and its allies during the Syrian conflict.

Ahmed argues that the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad's regime, despite being aware of the potential consequences, including the emergence of an Islamic State. This controversial stance suggests a deliberate choice to prioritize geopolitical objectives over the risks associated with fostering extremist groups.

The documents also reflect on President Obama's characterization of ISIS as a ""JV"" team, a remark that has been criticized as a significant miscalculation. Furthermore, the failure to maintain a residual U.S. military presence in Iraq is viewed as another critical error that may have contributed to the rise of ISIS.

In addition to insights on ISIS, the declassified documents provide information regarding weapons operations in Libya prior to the 2012 Benghazi attack. They indicate that U.S. intelligence was aware of weapons being shipped from Benghazi to Syria, raising further concerns about the implications of U.S. involvement in the region.

The report concludes with a stark assertion that American servicemen and women were sacrificed due to a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that prioritized concealment over national security. This revelation calls into question the motivations behind U.S. actions in the region and the long-term consequences of those decisions. As the implications of these findings continue to unfold, they may reshape the narrative surrounding U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.",-27.0,-14.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,382.0,-1.0769230769230769,-0.03664921465968586
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The incident, which occurred in broad daylight, has sparked a wave of speculation and concern regarding Clinton's health and her ability to participate in the upcoming presidential debates against Donald Trump.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her demeanor and appearance. Witnesses described her as looking noticeably more energetic and lighter than before, leading to questions about the nature of her earlier incident. However, it was not just her energy levels that caught the attention of onlookers; her physical appearance appeared to have changed significantly as well.

Among the most discussed aspects of her new look was a noticeable alteration in the shape of her nose. Observers speculated that Clinton may have undergone rhinoplasty, as the ""clone"" of Hillary Clinton now sports a Roman-type nose, contrasting sharply with the Nordic nose that has characterized her appearance for years. This change has led to further conjecture about the authenticity of the individual seen in Chelsea's apartment.

In addition to the nose alteration, the stand-in for Clinton appeared younger and lacked a distinctive mole that the real Hillary has above her right lip. These differences have fueled theories that the individual seen post-collapse may not be the real Hillary Clinton at all, but rather a double or ""clone."" Such speculation raises significant questions about the implications for her campaign and potential administration.

As the political landscape heats up, observers are left wondering whether the real Hillary Clinton will be able to participate in the upcoming debates with Donald Trump. The prospect of a stand-in conducting public appearances and official duties has led to concerns about the authenticity of the Clinton campaign. If the real Clinton is unable to fulfill her role, it could lead to a situation where voters are left questioning the legitimacy of her administration should she be elected.

The author of this article suggests that the public should be vigilant for signs of the alleged clone, such as a thinner appearance or an absence of health issues that have previously plagued the former Secretary of State. The implications of such a scenario could be far-reaching, potentially mirroring past concerns regarding the authenticity of President Obama during his time in office.

The situation has ignited a firestorm of debate among political commentators and the public alike. Many are left pondering the ramifications of a potential double taking on the responsibilities of a presidential candidate. If the speculation surrounding Clinton's health and appearance continues to grow, it could have a significant impact on her campaign strategy and voter perception.

As the election season progresses, the question remains: will the real Hillary Clinton be able to step back into the spotlight, or will her double take center stage? The uncertainty surrounding her health and the authenticity of her public appearances could play a pivotal role in shaping the narrative of the upcoming election.

While the views expressed in this article are those of the author and not necessarily endorsed by EagleRising.com, they reflect a growing concern among observers regarding the implications of Clinton's recent health scare and the potential for a double to assume her public persona. As the political arena becomes increasingly contentious, the need for transparency and authenticity in leadership has never been more critical. 

In a time when voters are seeking genuine representation, the possibility of a stand-in conducting official duties raises profound questions about the nature of political leadership and the trust placed in elected officials. As the nation watches closely, the unfolding story of Hillary Clinton's health and appearance will undoubtedly remain a focal point in the lead-up to the election.",8.0,8.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,706.0,0.32,0.0113314447592068
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent rumors surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have sparked significant concern regarding her health and political viability. Speculation intensified following the release of a video that appeared to show Clinton struggling with her eye movements, leading to discussions about a potential nervous breakdown.

Shortly after the video surfaced, Clinton canceled a scheduled fundraiser in North Carolina, raising eyebrows among her supporters and political analysts alike. This cancellation has fueled further speculation about her well-being, particularly as research indicates that Clinton has only one rally planned between September 20 and October 19, with no additional speaking engagements for fundraisers during that period.

In stark contrast, former President Donald Trump has four rallies scheduled between September 20 and 22, highlighting a stark difference in the campaign activity of the two political figures. This disparity has led to increased scrutiny of Clinton's ability to maintain a robust campaign schedule.

Concerns about Clinton's health have been compounded by reports of an incident where she required Secret Service assistance to navigate a set of two steps. Observers are predicting that her health issues may become more pronounced, potentially leading to a public meltdown that could have serious implications for her campaign.

In light of these developments, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly exploring potential replacements for Clinton, a move that underscores the gravity of the situation. However, the DNC faces challenges, as prominent figure Bernie Sanders has shown a lack of enthusiasm about entering the presidential race, complicating the party's options.

Clinton has long been positioned as the best and only choice for the Democrats, with a history of support that dates back four years. However, the current climate of uncertainty surrounding her health has led to speculation that the truth about her condition will eventually come to light, potentially impacting public perception of the Democratic Party as a whole.

As the situation continues to unfold, anticipation grows regarding further developments related to Clinton's health. The coming days may prove crucial in determining not only her political future but also the direction of the Democratic Party as it navigates this challenging landscape.",-8.0,12.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,402.0,0.8571428571428571,0.029850746268656716
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the quiet hours of a late night in the White House, President Barack Obama found himself tossing and turning, unable to escape the cacophony of loud snoring emanating from his wife, Michelle. The rhythmic sound echoed through the halls, a stark contrast to the weighty thoughts swirling in his mind. Feeling a mix of sadness and nervousness, he decided to wander the West Wing, seeking solace in the familiar surroundings of his workplace.

As he meandered through the dimly lit corridors, his eyes caught a glimpse of a word that would soon change the course of history: ""ISIS."" The letters seemed to leap out at him, and in a moment of inspiration—or perhaps madness—he grabbed a Post-It note and scribbled the word down. Little did he know, this seemingly innocuous act would set off a chain of events that would lead him down an unexpected path.

Months later, the scene shifted to the vibrant atmosphere of Coachella, where the pulsating beats of electronic music filled the air. Surrounded by the energy of the festival, Obama found himself lost in the rhythm, the music igniting a spark of creativity within him. It was here, amidst the throngs of festival-goers, that the audacious idea struck him: what if he were to start an international terrorist organization? The thought was both exhilarating and terrifying, but the seed had been planted.

Determined to be the first American president to create a terrorist group, Obama faced skepticism from those around him. When he shared his ambitious vision, many dismissed it as a joke, unable to fathom the seriousness of his intentions. Frustrated by the lack of support, he turned to a familiar ally—Hillary Clinton. Their long-standing friendship and political camaraderie made her the perfect confidante for his unconventional aspirations.

One fateful night, the two found themselves in the kitchen of the White House, the atmosphere charged with a mix of camaraderie and secrecy. As they shared a late-night snack, Obama took a deep breath and revealed a shocking truth: he was, in fact, a 97-year-old Kenyan man sent to destroy America. Hillary's reaction was one of disbelief and confusion, her mind racing to comprehend the implications of his revelation. The absurdity of the situation was not lost on them, especially when Obama casually mentioned that their beloved dog, Bo, was actually a supercomputer.

Despite the surreal nature of their conversation, the two shared a light-hearted moment, laughter punctuating the air as they processed the bizarre turn of events. Yet, as the laughter faded, Obama steered the conversation back to his plans for ISIS, eager to share his vision for the organization he intended to create.

To escape the confines of the kitchen, they moved to the Rose Garden, where the night sky twinkled above them like a canvas of stars. With drinks in hand and snacks laid out before them, Obama laid out his grand vision for ISIS. He spoke passionately about the potential for the group to reshape the world, to challenge the status quo, and to leave a lasting impact on history.

Hillary listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities. In a moment of inspiration, she proposed a daring idea: what if they waited until she became president to secretly destroy America together? The thought thrilled Obama, igniting a sense of excitement and camaraderie between them. They envisioned a future where they could work in tandem, their shared goals uniting them in a way that transcended traditional political boundaries.

As the night wore on, the two leaders found themselves feeling understood and connected, their bond deepening under the vast expanse of the starry sky. In that moment, they were not just a president and a former secretary of state; they were two friends sharing a dream, however unconventional it may have been.

The evening concluded with a sense of fulfillment, both Obama and Hillary reveling in the unique connection they had forged. As they parted ways, the weight of their conversation lingered in the air, a reminder of the unexpected paths that life can take and the unlikely alliances that can form in the most unexpected of circumstances.

In the days that followed, the world would continue to turn, unaware of the clandestine discussions that had taken place under the stars. But for Obama and Hillary, that night would remain etched in their memories—a night of revelations, laughter, and the birth of an idea that would forever alter the course of history.",-4.0,16.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,852.0,0.48484848484848486,0.018779342723004695
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the wake of recent attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, Frank Wilkenmeyer has taken a critical look at Donald Trump's bold assertion to ""destroy"" terrorism in America. This promise, while resonating with a segment of the population eager for decisive action, raises significant concerns about its implications for civil rights and the treatment of Muslim communities in the United States.

Trump's statement, which includes pointed personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton, reflects a broader strategy of scapegoating political opponents while attempting to position himself as the sole candidate capable of addressing the threat of terrorism. However, the language used in his rhetoric is troubling. The promise to ""destroy all terrorists"" not only oversimplifies a complex issue but also raises alarms about the potential for profiling and discrimination against Muslims, a community that has already faced significant scrutiny and prejudice in the post-9/11 era.

Wilkenmeyer emphasizes that such promises could lead to increased surveillance of Muslim communities, further entrenching a culture of fear and suspicion. The implications of this surveillance extend beyond mere observation; they threaten to create an environment where segregation becomes normalized, and where individuals are judged not by their actions but by their religious identity. This kind of profiling is not only ethically questionable but also counterproductive, as it alienates communities that are crucial in the fight against extremism.

Moreover, the article highlights a critical concern regarding due process for suspects, particularly American citizens. Trump's rhetoric suggests a willingness to bypass established legal protections in the name of national security. This disregard for due process is alarming, as it sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to the erosion of civil liberties. The implications of such a shift are profound, as it could pave the way for arbitrary detentions and a legal framework that prioritizes fear over justice.

Wilkenmeyer draws parallels between Trump's approach and historical instances of fascism, warning that the language of fear and division can lead to abuses of power. The author argues that when leaders resort to inflammatory rhetoric, they risk inciting violence and legitimizing discrimination. This is particularly concerning in a nation that prides itself on its democratic values and commitment to equality under the law.

The piece concludes with a sobering assessment of Trump's promises. Rather than offering realistic solutions to the complex issue of terrorism, they serve to instill fear among the populace. The notion that one can simply ""destroy"" terrorism is not only unrealistic but also dangerously simplistic. Terrorism is a multifaceted problem that requires nuanced understanding and comprehensive strategies, including community engagement, education, and international cooperation.

In summary, Wilkenmeyer's analysis serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of Trump's rhetoric. The promise to ""destroy"" terrorism, while appealing to some, carries with it the risk of infringing on civil rights, fostering division, and undermining the very principles that define American democracy. As the nation grapples with the realities of terrorism, it is imperative that leaders approach the issue with a commitment to justice, inclusivity, and respect for the rights of all citizens.",-28.0,-25.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,594.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04208754208754209
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

In a stark warning, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has highlighted a precarious tipping point in global security, citing the escalating threats posed by terrorism and hostilities from nations such as the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno's remarks underscore the urgent need for a reassessment of military readiness, as he noted that the Army is currently only generating sufficient preparedness to meet immediate operational demands.

The general expressed concern that further reductions in military capacity could have detrimental effects on national security. He pointed to a significant disconnect between military leadership and the current administration, attributing this gap to the Obama Administration's historical disregard for the strategies and advice of military commanders. This disconnect, according to Odierno, has played a role in the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa, exacerbating an already volatile situation.

Odierno did not shy away from criticizing the administration, labeling its approach as marked by incompetence and arrogance, which he believes has adversely affected the careers of military personnel. He characterized the current global landscape as a strategic inflection point, with determined adversaries posing serious threats to the security of the United States and its allies.

The Army has already made significant cuts, reducing its active force by 80,000 soldiers and eliminating 13 brigade combat teams along with three aviation brigades. These reductions have been accompanied by a 25% decrease in investment for modernization efforts, impacting critical programs such as infantry fighting vehicle upgrades and the development of scout helicopters.

As the Army navigates these challenges, Odierno's warnings serve as a call to action for both military and civilian leaders to prioritize national security and ensure that the armed forces are adequately equipped to face the evolving threats of a complex global landscape. The implications of these decisions will resonate far beyond the battlefield, affecting the safety and security of the nation for years to come.",-4.0,-24.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,362.0,-2.1818181818181817,-0.06629834254143646

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

He argues that the implications of this proposal could undermine the fundamental principles of free expression that are central to American democracy.

With the transfer of control scheduled to take effect on September 30, 2016, Cruz emphasizes the urgency for Congress to take action against the proposal before it is implemented. He believes that immediate legislative measures are necessary to protect the integrity of the Internet and ensure that it remains a platform for free and open discourse. As the deadline approaches, the debate over the future of Internet governance continues to intensify, with Cruz leading the charge against what he perceives as a significant threat to American freedoms.",3.0,9.0,218.0,0.2727272727272727,0.013761467889908258,216.0,1.2857142857142858,0.041666666666666664
Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

The decision follows a recent incident, the specifics of which have not been disclosed by university administrators.

In an email sent to Resident Advisors (RAs), the university instructed them to enforce the removal of all Harambe references from dormitories. RAs were warned that students who fail to comply with the ban could face consequences, emphasizing the seriousness of the directive.

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the nation approaches critical elections, the integrity of the electoral process remains a hotly debated topic. Every state has laws governing election methods and procedures, yet concerns persist regarding the potential for manipulation and fraud. The National Democratic Party has faced accusations of attempting to steal elections through various illegal means, raising alarms among those who prioritize fair and transparent voting practices.

The author of this piece, identifying as a Christian and Constitutional Conservative, expresses a deep-seated belief that the Democratic Party is striving to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States. This assertion is rooted in a series of allegations that have emerged over the years, particularly surrounding the 2016 presidential election. Claims of voter fraud and ballot stuffing have been levied against the Democratic Party, with specific accusations aimed at securing a win for Hillary Clinton.

In light of these allegations, the author advocates for fair elections, emphasizing the necessity of proper voter registration and the implementation of photo ID requirements. The argument is made that such measures are essential to ensure that only eligible individuals participate in the electoral process. The author contends that the Democratic Party's opposition to voter ID laws is a deliberate strategy to allow ineligible individuals to cast their votes, thereby undermining the integrity of elections.

Criticism is directed not only at the Democratic Party but also at the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system. The author argues that these entities have collectively suppressed fair election laws, contributing to an environment where voter fraud could flourish. This perspective underscores a broader concern about the erosion of democratic principles and the need for vigilance in protecting the electoral process.

In response to these challenges, the author calls upon citizens to take an active role in safeguarding elections. There is a strong encouragement for individuals to volunteer to monitor polling places, a proactive measure aimed at preventing voter fraud in the upcoming election. This call to action reflects a belief that grassroots involvement is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the electoral system.

The article also presents a positive portrayal of Donald Trump, framing him as a patriotic figure on a mission to save the country from perceived corruption. The author positions Trump as a bulwark against the alleged threats posed by the Democratic Party, further galvanizing support among those who share similar values of Constitutional Conservatism.

As the nation gears up for the elections, the author emphasizes that November 8, 2016, is a critical date for protecting the republic from what is described as Democratic corruption. This date is presented as a pivotal moment for citizens who value the principles of democracy and wish to ensure that their voices are heard in a fair and just electoral process.

In conclusion, the author urges all citizens who hold dear the tenets of Constitutional Conservatism to actively monitor elections to ensure their integrity. The views expressed in this article reflect a passionate commitment to preserving the democratic process and a call for vigilance against any perceived threats to election integrity. While the opinions articulated are solely those of the author and not necessarily endorsed by EagleRising.com, they resonate with a significant segment of the population concerned about the future of American democracy.

As the election date approaches, the discourse surrounding voter fraud, election integrity, and the role of citizens in safeguarding democracy will undoubtedly continue to evolve. The emphasis on active participation and the call for stringent election laws highlight the ongoing struggle to balance accessibility with security in the electoral process. In a time of heightened political tension, the importance of fair elections remains a cornerstone of American democracy, and the commitment to uphold these principles is more crucial than ever.",-52.0,4.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,692.0,0.16,0.005780346820809248
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the annals of American political advertising, few images are as haunting and memorable as the 1964 political ad featuring a young girl picking daisies, set against the ominous backdrop of a mushroom cloud. This ad, famously approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was designed to evoke fear and urgency, portraying his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a reckless warmonger. The stark contrast between innocence and the threat of nuclear annihilation was a powerful tool in Johnson's campaign, effectively swaying public opinion during a tumultuous time in American history.

Fast forward to the present, and one cannot help but wonder how a modern version of this iconic ad might look, particularly in the context of Hillary Clinton's campaign. The suggestion is that such an ad could highlight the failures and controversies surrounding Clinton, potentially undermining her bid for the presidency. The political landscape has shifted dramatically since Johnson's time, but the fundamental principles of fear-based advertising remain relevant. 

Rumors have begun to circulate about a potential ""Daisy"" remake aimed at Donald Trump, a move that some interpret as a sign of desperation among Clinton's campaign staff. The idea of resurrecting such a potent symbol of political fear suggests that the stakes are perceived to be incredibly high, and that Clinton's team may feel the need to resort to extreme measures to secure her position in the race. 

As the election cycle progresses, voters find themselves grappling with a media landscape that often seems biased and selective in its coverage. This is particularly evident in the case of Ted Cruz, whose recent political shifts have drawn scrutiny. The media's portrayal of Cruz has been inconsistent, with critical details about his past comments regarding Trump often buried beneath layers of sensationalism. This selective reporting raises questions about the integrity of journalism and its role in shaping public perception.

The tendency of the media to overlook or downplay significant information reflects a broader issue within American journalism: the short attention spans of the public. In an age where news cycles are rapid and fleeting, critical details can easily be lost, leaving voters with an incomplete understanding of the candidates and their positions. This phenomenon is particularly troubling in a political climate where informed decision-making is crucial.

Moreover, there is a growing perception of bias in media coverage against Democratic and liberal figures. This has led to the acceptance of the ""liberal press"" label, which critics argue undermines the credibility of journalism as a whole. The implications of this bias are far-reaching, as it can skew public perception and influence electoral outcomes. 

As the upcoming debate approaches, the specter of past moderating mistakes looms large. The memory of Candy Crowley's handling of the 2012 presidential debate still resonates, serving as a reminder of the potential pitfalls that moderators face. The stakes are high, and the pressure to maintain impartiality while navigating the complexities of political discourse is immense.

In the context of Hillary Clinton's campaign, it is worth noting that past criticisms from prominent figures, including Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, have often been overlooked in current discussions. These critiques, which once held significant weight, seem to have faded from the public consciousness, raising questions about the consistency of media narratives and the factors that influence them.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the call for a new ""Daisy"" ad that documents Clinton's shortcomings becomes increasingly relevant. Such an ad could serve as a powerful reminder of the potential consequences of her policies and decisions, echoing the fear and urgency that characterized Johnson's original campaign. The impact of a modern adaptation could be profound, potentially resonating with voters in a way that transcends traditional political messaging.

In conclusion, the legacy of the 1964 ""Daisy"" ad serves as a poignant reminder of the power of political advertising and the emotions it can evoke. As the current election cycle unfolds, the potential for a modern iteration of this iconic ad raises important questions about the effectiveness of fear-based messaging in contemporary politics. With the stakes higher than ever, the need for voters to be informed and engaged has never been more critical. The challenge lies in navigating a media landscape that often prioritizes sensationalism over substance, and in ensuring that the voices of all candidates are heard in a fair and balanced manner. As we look ahead to the debates and the election, the call for transparency and accountability in political discourse remains paramount.",-18.0,0.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,846.0,0.0,0.0

Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there.

In a heated political climate, Democrats have been accused of employing intimidation tactics in response to ongoing questions regarding President Barack Obama's birth certificate. Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, has labeled the inquiry as inherently racist. However, critics argue that this assertion is a non-sequitur, lacking logical foundation.

The article presents several pieces of evidence that fuel skepticism about the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate. Allegations have surfaced suggesting that the document may have been altered. Additionally, it has been noted that Obama's social security number was issued in Connecticut, a state where he has no known residency. Compounding these concerns, the hospital cited on the birth certificate reportedly did not exist at the time the document was supposedly issued. Furthermore, the birth certificate itself contains errors that raise questions about its validity.

The article also probes whether an original birth certificate has ever been made public, emphasizing that claims of racism and ""birther"" smears may serve as distractions from the absence of concrete evidence. The author expresses disappointment in Donald Trump's response to these allegations, suggesting a lack of engagement with the substantive issues at hand.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished.

Peter Allan expressed sadness over the assaults but noted a sense of relief that the victims were on the path to recovery.

The attacks have sparked a broader conversation about the acceptance of the gay community in contrast to the views held by radical Islam, which condemns homosexuality. The stark reality is that radical ideologies and the LGBTQ+ community often find themselves at odds, as illustrated by Woods' harrowing experience. 

As society continues to grapple with issues of acceptance and tolerance, the violent actions against Woods serve as a grim reminder of the challenges that still exist. The need for dialogue and understanding is more pressing than ever, as communities strive to create safe environments for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.

The incidents involving Woods and the gay couple underscore the urgent need for continued advocacy and support for the LGBTQ+ community. As the conversation around acceptance evolves, it is crucial to address the underlying prejudices that fuel such violence, ensuring that no one has to endure the pain that Woods has faced.",-26.0,-44.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,389.0,-2.933333333333333,-0.11311053984575835
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).

Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On Saturday night, a shocking incident unfolded at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, when a man dressed in a security uniform launched a violent attack on shoppers, leaving nine people injured. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" during the assault. Eyewitnesses recounted a scene of chaos as Adan moved through the mall, asking at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing them.

The St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly identified Adan as the attacker, and the situation escalated further when ISIS claimed him as one of their own. This declaration raised alarms about the potential for radicalization within immigrant communities and the ongoing threat posed by extremist groups.

The attack occurred against a backdrop of heightened tensions surrounding terrorism in the United States. Just prior to the St. Cloud incident, there were reports of a bomb explosion at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and a separate attack involving a meat cleaver on police officers in New York. These incidents have contributed to a growing sense of unease among the public regarding safety and security in everyday environments.

In the aftermath of the attack, community members expressed their support for Adan's family, describing him as a good man and an accomplished student. This sentiment reflects the complexity of the situation, as many in the Somali-American community grapple with the implications of Adan's actions while trying to maintain their identity and support for one another.

The situation was brought to a swift conclusion when Officer Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer, intervened and shot Adan during the attack. Mayor of St. Cloud, who praised Falconer as a hero, emphasized the importance of his quick response in preventing further injuries and potential loss of life.

The incident has reignited discussions about the Somali refugee population in Minnesota, which has seen nearly 10,000 individuals relocated to the state during the Obama administration. While many Somali immigrants have successfully integrated into American society, there are ongoing concerns about the vulnerability of some individuals to recruitment by terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al-Shabab. 

The history of Somali-Americans in Minnesota is marked by a series of troubling incidents, including past convictions for collaboration with Islamist groups. These events have raised questions about the effectiveness of integration efforts and the potential for radicalization within the community. Additionally, there have been reports of threats made by Somali refugees, further complicating the narrative surrounding this population.

As ISIS continues to gain strength in Somalia, bolstered by support from Yemen, the implications for U.S. national security are significant. The potential for increased Muslim refugee resettlement under a Clinton administration has sparked fears that it could lead to a rise in terror attacks on American soil. Critics argue that such policies could exacerbate existing tensions and create an environment conducive to radicalization.

The political landscape surrounding these issues is fraught with division. The author of this article expresses strong opposition to Hillary Clinton, linking her policies to increased risks of terrorism in the United States. In contrast, the author endorses Donald Trump as a safer choice, suggesting that his approach to immigration and national security would better protect American citizens.

As the St. Cloud community begins to heal from the trauma of the attack, the broader implications of this incident will likely continue to resonate. The complexities of immigration, integration, and the threat of radicalization remain pressing issues that demand careful consideration and dialogue. 

In the wake of the attack, community leaders are calling for unity and understanding, urging residents to come together to support one another in this difficult time. The hope is that through open conversations and collaborative efforts, the community can work towards preventing future violence and fostering a sense of safety for all its members.

As investigations continue and the community processes the events of that fateful night, the St. Cloud mall attack serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by immigrant communities in the United States. The need for vigilance, understanding, and proactive measures to address the root causes of radicalization has never been more critical. 

In conclusion, the St. Cloud mall attack has left an indelible mark on the community, prompting discussions about safety, integration, and the ongoing threat of terrorism. As the nation grapples with these complex issues, the hope is that lessons learned from this tragedy will lead to a more secure and inclusive society for all.",-72.0,-10.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,836.0,-0.2564102564102564,-0.011961722488038277
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, the term ""everyone gets a trophy generation"" has been used to describe Millennials, suggesting a cultural shift towards declining standards for victimhood. This narrative has gained traction in various discussions, particularly in the context of individuals who commit acts of violence while simultaneously portraying themselves as victims of societal injustices. A notable example of this phenomenon is Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the New Jersey and New York City bombings.

Rahami, who has been linked to a series of bombings in 2016, previously claimed to be a victim of ""Islamophobia."" This assertion came in the wake of his family's legal battles with local authorities, which they argued were rooted in discrimination against their Muslim faith. In 2011, Rahami and his father filed a lawsuit against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department, alleging that they were subjected to discrimination and ""selective enforcement"" concerning their chicken restaurant, First American.

The lawsuit detailed a series of grievances, with the Rahami family claiming that local residents had racially abused them, stating phrases like ""Muslims don’t belong here."" This claim of victimhood was central to their legal argument, as they sought redress for what they perceived as systemic bias against them due to their religion. However, Mayor Christian Bollwage of Elizabeth denied the allegations of discrimination, asserting that the complaints against the Rahami family were primarily related to noise and issues stemming from street congregation outside their restaurant.

Despite their efforts, the Rahami family's lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful. This legal defeat did not deter Ahmad Khan Rahami from his subsequent actions, which culminated in the bombings that shocked both New Jersey and New York City. The juxtaposition of his claims of victimhood against the backdrop of his violent actions raises critical questions about the narratives surrounding individuals who resort to terrorism.

Critics of the situation argue that Rahami's case exemplifies a troubling trend where individuals, particularly those involved in acts of terror, adopt a victim narrative to justify their actions. This perspective suggests that the portrayal of oneself as a victim can serve as a dangerous catalyst for violence, as it may foster a sense of entitlement to act against perceived oppressors.

The implications of this narrative extend beyond Rahami's case, as it reflects broader societal issues regarding how victimhood is defined and perceived. In a world where the lines between victim and perpetrator can become blurred, it is essential to critically examine the motivations and backgrounds of those who commit acts of violence. The case of Ahmad Khan Rahami serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities surrounding victimhood and the potential consequences of a culture that may inadvertently encourage such narratives.",-38.0,-46.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,514.0,-2.7058823529411766,-0.08949416342412451
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to move businesses if employees don't vote in their favor.

In a landscape where corporate influence looms large over political processes, the tactics employed by employers to sway employee voting behavior have come under scrutiny. Historically, employers have threatened to relocate their businesses if employees do not cast their votes in favor of their interests. This trend raises significant concerns about the implications for workers, particularly in industries where job security and fair wages are already precarious.

One prominent figure in this ongoing debate is Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Puzder has made headlines for his explicit threats regarding the potential for increased automation should a Democrat win the upcoming election. His comments resonate with a pattern established by other corporate leaders, such as ""Papa"" John Schnatter, who similarly warned of dire consequences for workers during the last presidential election. These threats serve as a stark reminder of the lengths to which some employers will go to protect their interests, often at the expense of their employees.

Puzder's plans for his restaurants include the implementation of advanced automation systems, such as Eatsa, which significantly reduces human interaction in the dining experience. This shift towards automation is not merely a response to market demands but also a strategic maneuver to mitigate labor costs. Puzder argues that raising the minimum wage inevitably leads to job losses, framing the debate around wage increases as a zero-sum game. He questions the benefits of higher wages for some workers if it results in others losing their jobs altogether.

With approximately 20,000 employees under his purview, Puzder's influence extends beyond his own restaurants. He aims to sway not only his workforce but also other low-wage workers to vote against their own interests. This tactic raises ethical questions about the responsibilities of employers in the political arena and the potential consequences for workers who may feel pressured to align their voting choices with corporate agendas.

Puzder's engagement in political discourse is further exemplified by his blog, where he discusses topics related to politics and capitalism. This platform allows him to articulate his views and potentially shape the opinions of his employees regarding the economic system that governs their livelihoods. However, it also raises questions about the extent to which his employees share in the financial success of the company. Despite Puzder's significant earnings—nearly $4.5 million in 2012—and the rising profits of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, the financial benefits do not appear to trickle down to the workers who contribute to that success.

The looming threat of automation, coupled with the historical precedent of employer intimidation, paints a concerning picture for the future of labor relations. Puzder's commitment to automating his restaurants seems unwavering, regardless of the election outcome. This prioritization of profits over employee welfare underscores a broader trend in the corporate world, where the interests of shareholders often take precedence over the needs of workers.

As the election approaches, the implications of these corporate strategies will likely become more pronounced. Workers may find themselves caught in a complex web of corporate influence, where their voting choices are shaped by the very employers who hold their job security in the balance. The challenge for employees will be to navigate this landscape, advocating for their rights and interests in the face of mounting pressure from powerful corporate entities.

In conclusion, the intersection of corporate power and political influence raises critical questions about the future of work and the rights of employees. As employers like Andy Puzder continue to wield their influence in the electoral process, the need for a robust dialogue about workers' rights and protections becomes increasingly urgent. The outcomes of these elections will not only shape the political landscape but also determine the future of labor relations in an era marked by automation and corporate consolidation.",21.0,13.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,710.0,0.48148148148148145,0.018309859154929577
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category

In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a significant development that has reignited the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, the FBI is currently investigating new evidence that has emerged during an inquiry into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin. This investigation has unveiled a potential treasure trove of information that could have serious implications for both Clinton and Abedin.

The evidence in question was discovered on a laptop shared by Abedin and Weiner, which may contain ""tens of thousands of emails"" from Abedin. Notably, some of these emails are believed to have been forwarded from Clinton's account and were not previously submitted to the FBI during its earlier investigation. The implications of this discovery are profound; if these emails are found to be work-related or classified, both Clinton and Abedin could face charges for allegedly lying to the FBI.

The urgency of the situation is underscored by the timing of the FBI's letter, which was released just 11 days before the presidential election. This timing has raised eyebrows and led to speculation about the seriousness of the findings and their potential impact on the election outcome.

The backdrop to this renewed investigation dates back to July 2016, when FBI Director James Comey publicly outlined the evidence against Clinton but ultimately did not recommend charges. This decision was met with discontent among various FBI officials, who felt that the case warranted more serious consequences. A high-ranking FBI official later revealed that there was a strong desire among agents to revoke Clinton's security clearance and pursue prosecution.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, an FBI summary has surfaced, indicating that a State Department official allegedly pressured the FBI to declassify certain information in exchange for additional agents at diplomatic posts. This revelation has raised questions about the integrity of the investigation and the potential influence of external factors on the FBI's decision-making process.

Moreover, the summary also highlighted the existence of a group of State Department officials, referred to as ""The Shadow Government,"" who were reportedly involved in discussions regarding Freedom of Information requests related to Clinton's emails. This group’s activities have led to further scrutiny of the State Department's handling of the investigation and its interactions with the FBI.

In a separate but related incident, it has been reported that Clinton ignored security advice during her campaign, putting herself and others at risk for the sake of a photo opportunity. This behavior has drawn criticism and raised concerns about her judgment and adherence to security protocols.

The investigation has also revealed troubling financial connections. A Clinton supporter reportedly donated nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official involved in the investigation, prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest and the integrity of the investigation.

Central to the controversy is Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was identified as having deleted over 33,000 emails from Clinton's private server. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department, a decision that has been met with skepticism and concern regarding the motivations behind the deletions.

Leaked emails have further complicated the narrative, suggesting that Clinton communicated with President Obama via her private server. This revelation contradicts previous claims made by Clinton that the President was unaware of her use of a private email system, raising questions about transparency and accountability.

Additionally, further emails indicate that Clinton personally deleted emails without any oversight, which has led to speculation about her intent and the legality of her actions. While the FBI did not press charges against Clinton due to a perceived lack of intent, the emergence of new evidence suggests that this conclusion may need to be reevaluated.

The timeline of events surrounding the investigation and the deletion of emails is critical to understanding the full scope of the controversy. Key dates highlight potential collusion and cover-up efforts, painting a picture of a complex web of interactions and decisions that have far-reaching implications.

As the FBI continues its investigation into this new evidence, the political ramifications are likely to be significant. With the election looming, the findings could influence public perception and voter sentiment, making this a pivotal moment in the ongoing saga of Hillary Clinton's email controversy. The stakes are high, and the outcome of this investigation could have lasting effects on the political landscape in the United States. 

In conclusion, the renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, spurred by new evidence uncovered during the inquiry into Anthony Weiner, has the potential to reshape the narrative surrounding her actions and the broader implications for accountability in government.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In a recent address at her party's annual conference, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on the challenges posed by her open borders policy for Syrian refugees, a stance she has long championed. While Merkel's approach aimed to provide sanctuary to those fleeing conflict, it has been met with significant backlash from the German public, particularly in light of rising crime rates associated with the influx of migrants.

Reports indicate a troubling increase in crime, including thousands of sexual assaults and violent incidents in various German cities, which have fueled public discontent. This growing unease culminated in a substantial electoral defeat for Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), signaling a shift in public sentiment regarding her refugee policies.

Acknowledging the ramifications of the migrant crisis, Merkel expressed regret during her speech, stating that the issues could have been avoided. She described the concept of multiculturalism as a “living lie,” a stark admission that underscores the complexities of integrating a large number of refugees into German society.

Despite her previous optimistic slogan, ""we can do this,"" Merkel conceded that Germany's ability to manage the situation hinges on controlling the influx of migrants. She cautioned that if migration levels remain high, they could overwhelm the country's state and societal structures, leading to further complications.

In response to the mounting pressures, Merkel announced plans to significantly reduce the number of refugees entering Germany. However, she resisted calls to establish a specific cap on arrivals, indicating a preference for a more flexible approach. Instead, she emphasized the necessity of a coordinated strategy at the German, European, and global levels to effectively regulate and limit migration.

Merkel's remarks reflect a pivotal moment in her leadership, as she grapples with the consequences of her policies while attempting to navigate the complex landscape of public opinion and international obligations. As Germany continues to confront the realities of the refugee crisis, the chancellor's commitment to a balanced and controlled approach may shape the future of the nation’s immigration policies.",-2.0,-8.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,393.0,-0.6153846153846154,-0.020356234096692113

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.",http://freedomdaily.com/disgusting-because-of-hillary-obama-ny-terrorist-will-get-better-treatment-than-us-vets/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3895D4C900000578-3798726-Ahmad_Khan_Rahami_28_was_taken_into_custody_on_Monday_after_a_sh-a-65_1474398076306.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a striking revelation, it has come to light that Ahmad Rahami, the terrorist responsible for planting explosives in New Jersey and New York City, will receive superior medical care compared to that of U.S. veterans. This situation has sparked outrage and frustration among many, particularly in light of a troubling history of inadequate care within the Veterans Administration (VA).

The issue was brought to the forefront during a recent campaign speech by former President Donald Trump, who criticized the stark contrast in medical treatment available to Rahami versus the struggles faced by veterans. Trump emphasized that Rahami will have access to top doctors, modern hospital facilities, and legal representation, while many veterans continue to suffer from a lack of timely and effective care.

This disparity is particularly poignant when considering the fallout from a 2014 scandal at the VA, which revealed long waiting lists and cover-ups of inefficiency that plagued the system. The scandal highlighted the dire circumstances many veterans face, with over 300,000 having died while waiting for care. The situation has only worsened, as reports indicate that veteran suicides have occurred while individuals awaited treatment, including tragic incidents in VA parking lots.

The frustration surrounding this issue is palpable, as many Americans grapple with the reality that a terrorist will receive better medical attention than those who have served their country. The government’s failure to provide adequate care for veterans stands in stark contrast to the treatment afforded to individuals like Rahami, raising serious questions about priorities and values within the healthcare system.

As the nation reflects on these disparities, the plight of veterans remains a pressing concern. Advocates for veterans' rights continue to call for reforms within the VA to ensure that those who have sacrificed for their country receive the care and support they deserve. The juxtaposition of Rahami's treatment against the backdrop of veteran care serves as a rallying point for those seeking to hold the government accountable for its obligations to its servicemen and women.

In conclusion, the situation underscores a critical need for systemic change within the VA to address the long-standing issues that have left many veterans without the care they need. As the debate continues, the hope is that the voices advocating for veterans will lead to meaningful reforms that prioritize their health and well-being over the treatment of those who threaten the very fabric of society.",13.0,-8.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,451.0,-0.5714285714285714,-0.017738359201773836
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a dramatic incident that unfolded in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, became a hero when he intervened during a violent attack by an ISIS terrorist. The assailant, a 22-year-old Somali immigrant, stabbed eight people before Falconer stepped in, using his firearm to neutralize the threat and potentially saving countless lives in the process.

Falconer, who has dedicated his life to protecting citizens both as a law enforcement officer and through his firearms training company, Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., has become a symbol of self-defense and responsible gun ownership. His business focuses on training law-abiding citizens in concealed carry practices, empowering individuals to protect themselves and their loved ones in dangerous situations.

However, Falconer's commendable actions and his commitment to public safety have come under scrutiny from political figures, most notably Hillary Clinton. The former Secretary of State has made it clear that if elected president, she aims to put Falconer out of business by targeting his firearms training company. Clinton's campaign has outlined a series of policies that would directly impact businesses like Falconer's, raising concerns among gun rights advocates.

One of the key elements of Clinton's agenda is the elimination of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). This legislation currently protects firearms manufacturers and dealers from frivolous lawsuits, allowing businesses like Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. to operate without the constant threat of legal action stemming from the misuse of firearms. Critics argue that repealing the PLCAA would create an environment where gun makers and trainers could be held liable for the actions of criminals, effectively stifling the industry and undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.

Clinton has faced accusations of misrepresenting the PLCAA, claiming that it provides ""immunity"" to gunmakers and dealers. This assertion has been challenged by many in the firearms community, who argue that the law simply prevents unjust lawsuits that could cripple businesses and infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of individuals like Falconer.

The implications of Clinton's policies extend beyond just Falconer and his business. They represent a broader threat to the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves. Supporters of gun rights argue that responsible firearm training is essential for public safety, and that individuals should have the ability to learn how to protect themselves without fear of political retribution or legal consequences.

Falconer's experience as a police officer and his dedication to firearms training highlight the importance of self-defense education in today's society. His actions during the St. Cloud stabbing incident serve as a reminder of the critical role that trained individuals can play in protecting their communities from violence. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the debate over gun rights and self-defense training remains at the forefront, with Falconer standing as a testament to the impact that responsible gun ownership can have in saving lives.

As the presidential campaign heats up, the stakes for individuals like Jason Falconer could not be higher. With Clinton's proposed policies threatening to dismantle the very foundation of self-defense training and responsible gun ownership, the future of businesses like Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. hangs in the balance. The outcome of this political battle will not only affect Falconer but could also have lasting implications for the rights of citizens across the nation.",-11.0,6.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,632.0,0.25,0.00949367088607595
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election season heats up, the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has emerged as a significant topic of discussion among voters and political analysts alike. Recent polling data reveals a notable shift in public perception regarding Clinton's health, with a growing number of registered voters expressing concerns about her well-being.

A recent poll indicates that over 40% of registered voters now believe Clinton is in ""below average"" or ""very poor"" health, a substantial increase from just 26% in late August. This rising skepticism about her health status has raised alarms within her campaign and among her supporters, as they navigate the implications of such perceptions on her candidacy.

In contrast, the belief that Donald Trump, Clinton's primary opponent, is in ""above average"" or ""excellent"" health has seen a slight uptick, rising from 33% to 36%. This disparity in public opinion could play a crucial role in shaping voter sentiment as the election approaches.

Despite the growing concerns about her health, the percentage of voters who consider Clinton's health to be ""average"" has remained steady at 28%. However, nearly 80% of respondents are aware of Clinton's potential medical issues, suggesting that her health is a topic that resonates deeply with the electorate.

At 68 years old, Clinton is often perceived as looking older than her age, which has further fueled speculation about her health. Observers have noted that she appears to be experiencing physical distress, with reports of her taking Coumadin, a medication commonly prescribed for blood clotting issues, and researching Provigil, a drug typically used to treat serious conditions such as narcolepsy.

Concerns about Clinton's health have been exacerbated by various public appearances where she has exhibited signs of confusion, fatigue, and physical discomfort. Videos and photographs have captured moments where Clinton has needed assistance navigating stairs and has shown signs of requiring support while speaking. Such instances have not gone unnoticed, leading to increased scrutiny of her overall health.

One particularly alarming incident occurred during a public appearance at the 9/11 Memorial, where Clinton was seen appearing unsteady and ultimately passed out. Reports have surfaced claiming that videos of this incident are being removed from the internet, raising questions about transparency and the handling of her health narrative.

The Clinton campaign appears to be taking a cautious approach in response to these concerns, with observations suggesting that they are limiting her public appearances to mitigate the risk of showcasing her health issues. This strategy may be an attempt to control the narrative surrounding her health and maintain voter confidence as the election draws nearer.

Adding to the public's apprehension, Clinton's frequent coughing during speeches has garnered significant attention. This persistent issue has led to speculation about her overall health and has become a focal point for critics and supporters alike. The visibility of these health-related concerns has the potential to impact her campaign's momentum and voter perception.

As the election season progresses, the implications of Clinton's health on her candidacy remain to be seen. With a significant portion of the electorate expressing doubts about her well-being, the former Secretary of State faces a challenging landscape as she seeks to reassure voters of her fitness for office.

In a political climate where health can be a decisive factor in voter decision-making, Clinton's campaign will need to address these concerns head-on. Whether through increased transparency regarding her health or a strategic shift in public engagement, the stakes are high as the election approaches.

As voters continue to weigh their options, the narrative surrounding Clinton's health will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. With both Clinton and Trump vying for the support of the electorate, the focus on health and wellness in politics has never been more pronounced. The coming weeks will be critical for Clinton as she navigates these challenges and seeks to bolster public confidence in her candidacy.",-11.0,16.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,752.0,0.5925925925925926,0.02127659574468085

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle, a former high school sweetheart of Bill Clinton, has unveiled a controversial tell-all book titled ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which offers a scathing portrayal of both Bill and Hillary Clinton. The book delves into Hillary's alleged aggressive demeanor towards individuals she considers beneath her, painting a picture of a woman with a pronounced sense of superiority.

Kyle shares personal anecdotes that shed light on the couple's attitudes and behaviors, providing readers with a glimpse into their private lives. One particularly shocking incident recounted in the book involves Hillary making derogatory remarks about developmentally challenged children during an Easter egg hunt at the governor's mansion. This incident serves to illustrate the author's claims about Hillary's perceived disdain for those she views as less fortunate.

Throughout the narrative, Hillary is depicted as looking down on the people of Arkansas, referring to them as ""ignorant hillbillies."" This characterization suggests a disconnect between the Clintons and the very constituents they were meant to serve. Raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois, Hillary's background is highlighted as a contributing factor to her sense of superiority, which reportedly intensified during her campaigns in New York.

The book also touches on the Clintons' growing dissatisfaction with their time in Arkansas. According to Kyle, this discontent played a significant role in Bill Clinton's decision to forgo running for reelection in 1990, as he set his sights on a presidential bid. 

""Hillary: The Other Woman"" promises to stir controversy and reignite discussions about the Clintons' legacy, as Kyle's revelations challenge the public's perception of the couple. As the book gains attention, it remains to be seen how these claims will impact the Clintons' reputation and the ongoing discourse surrounding their political careers.",-10.0,-5.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,344.0,-0.4166666666666667,-0.014534883720930232

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking ruling, a Massachusetts judge has established a special law that permits black males to flee from police officers without facing legal repercussions. This decision, which is now in effect and cannot be appealed, has sparked significant debate regarding its implications for public safety and law enforcement practices.

The judge's ruling stems from concerns about the fear that some black Americans experience when interacting with police officers. This fear, the judge argues, often leads to a tendency among these individuals to flee from law enforcement. Under the new law, individuals who feel they are being ""disproportionately"" targeted by police are now legally allowed to run away without the risk of being pursued or penalized.

Historically, fleeing from a police officer could establish ""reasonable suspicion,"" allowing law enforcement to detain and investigate individuals. However, this new ruling fundamentally alters that dynamic, raising alarms about the potential consequences for public safety. Critics argue that the law undermines the ability of police officers to effectively protect and serve their communities, as it effectively grants individuals the freedom to evade law enforcement without fear of accountability.

The implications of this ruling have led to skepticism among various stakeholders, particularly regarding its potential to benefit those with criminal intent. By allowing individuals to flee without consequence, there are concerns that the law may inadvertently encourage criminal behavior, as it removes a critical deterrent against evading police.

As the law takes effect, community leaders and law enforcement officials are grappling with the challenges it presents. Many are questioning how police will be able to maintain order and ensure public safety in an environment where fleeing from officers is no longer a prosecutable offense. The ruling has ignited a broader conversation about the balance between addressing the concerns of marginalized communities and ensuring the safety of all citizens.

Supporters of the ruling argue that it is a necessary step toward addressing systemic issues within law enforcement and acknowledging the fears that many black Americans face. They contend that the law is a response to a long history of racial profiling and unjust treatment by police, and that it provides a measure of protection for those who feel targeted.

However, the ruling's critics maintain that it could lead to increased danger for citizens, as individuals who may pose a threat can now evade police scrutiny. The debate surrounding this law is likely to continue as communities assess its impact on public safety and the relationship between law enforcement and the populations they serve.

As Massachusetts navigates this uncharted territory, the ruling serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in reforming policing practices while ensuring the safety and security of all residents. The coming months will be crucial in determining the long-term effects of this controversial decision.",-13.0,-18.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,523.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.03441682600382409
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

In his remarks, Sansaricq criticized the response to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, asserting that corruption overshadowed the essential aid that was needed during that crisis.

Sansaricq highlighted that despite billions of dollars flowing into the Clinton Foundation, the Haitian populace continues to endure significant hardships. He accused the Clintons of exploiting the disaster for personal gain, alleging that they have stolen billions from the Haitian people. He pointed out the stark contrast between the Clintons' growing wealth and the ongoing plight of many Haitians, who are still living in tents years after the earthquake.

The former senator called for greater transparency regarding the funds allocated for aid and questioned the reasons behind the failure to deliver assistance effectively. His comments resonate with themes presented in Peter Schweizer’s book ""Clinton Cash,"" which scrutinizes the financial dealings of the Clintons.

At a recent Trump rally, Sansaricq claimed that President Bill Clinton attempted to bribe him, which he alleges led to the revocation of his visa after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed that she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance to revisit the past. This revelation comes in the wake of the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) disappointing performance in recent elections in Berlin, which has been interpreted as a reflection of the growing anti-migrant sentiment within Germany.

Merkel's comments signal a potential shift in her approach to refugee policy, as she acknowledged her unpreparedness for the challenges posed by the 2015 refugee crisis. Taking responsibility for the CDU's poor election results, she indicated that the party must reassess its stance in light of the changing political landscape.

The election results have underscored a notable rise in support for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has capitalized on public discontent regarding immigration. This shift in voter sentiment has raised alarms within Merkel's party, as it suggests a significant backlash against her previous policies.

Despite her regrets about the past, Merkel has firmly dismissed the notion of implementing substantial changes to her existing policy framework. She specifically rejected calls from the Christian Social Union (CSU) for a cap on the number of migrants allowed into the country, as well as proposals to prioritize Christian migrants over their Muslim counterparts. Merkel emphasized that such a stance would contradict the fundamental principles of her party and the core values of Germany.

The tension between Merkel and CSU leader Horst Seehofer has been palpable, particularly during the 2017 campaign when Seehofer threatened to withdraw his party's support over the contentious issue of a migrant cap. This ongoing friction highlights the internal divisions within the ruling coalition regarding how to address the complexities of migration and integration.

Merkel's remarks come against a backdrop of rising concerns about terrorism and crime, which some attribute to the influx of refugees. This anti-migrant atmosphere has fueled fears that her policies may lead to further electoral challenges in the upcoming federal elections. As public sentiment shifts, Merkel faces the daunting task of reconciling her commitment to humanitarian principles with the growing calls for stricter immigration controls.

The chancellor's willingness to reconsider her approach to refugee policy reflects a broader recognition of the changing dynamics in German society. As the political landscape evolves, Merkel's leadership will be tested as she navigates the delicate balance between upholding Germany's values and addressing the concerns of an increasingly skeptical electorate.

In summary, while Merkel has expressed a desire to change her past decisions regarding migration, she remains steadfast in her commitment to the principles that have guided her policies. The CDU's recent electoral setbacks serve as a stark reminder of the challenges ahead, as the party grapples with the implications of its stance on immigration in a country that is becoming more divided on the issue. As the next federal election approaches, the future of Merkel's policies and her party's fortunes hang in the balance.",-14.0,-1.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,553.0,-0.05263157894736842,-0.0018083182640144665
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In a disturbing incident that has drawn attention to issues of domestic violence and the treatment of women, Abdullah, a Somali asylum seeker residing in Sundsvall, Sweden, was arrested following a brutal assault on his pregnant wife. Known to local police for a history of violent crimes, Abdullah has been living off welfare benefits since his arrival in Sweden five years ago.

The incident unfolded after Abdullah returned home from a night out with friends. Prior to his return, he had demanded that his wife’s niece, whom she was babysitting, leave the premises. However, upon discovering that the niece was still present, Abdullah reacted with extreme violence. Witnesses report that he physically attacked his wife, kicking her in the head and stomach, leaving her in a state of distress and fear.

The assault did not end there. In a further act of humiliation, Abdullah poured beer over his wife and urinated on her, actions that have sparked outrage and condemnation from various community members and advocates for women's rights. This incident raises serious concerns about the safety and well-being of women in domestic settings, particularly among vulnerable populations.

The case has also ignited discussions surrounding the interpretation of religious texts and their application in modern society. Abdullah's actions have been juxtaposed with Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. Critics have pointed out the selective adherence to Islamic teachings displayed by Abdullah, who, while invoking religious justification for his actions, simultaneously engages in behavior that contradicts the very principles he claims to uphold. His consumption of alcohol and abandonment of his wife starkly contrast with the values of respect and care that are central to many interpretations of Islamic teachings.

This incident is not just a reflection of Abdullah's personal failings but also highlights broader societal issues regarding the treatment of women and the challenges faced by asylum seekers in integrating into a new culture. The complexities of navigating cultural differences, particularly in relation to gender roles and domestic violence, are significant and require urgent attention from both community leaders and policymakers.

As the investigation continues, local authorities are emphasizing the importance of support systems for victims of domestic violence. Organizations dedicated to assisting women in crisis are being called upon to provide resources and safe havens for those affected by similar situations. The community is urged to come together to address these pressing issues, ensuring that victims are heard and supported.

Abdullah's case serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for comprehensive measures to combat domestic violence and protect the rights of women, particularly within vulnerable populations. As discussions around this incident unfold, it is crucial for society to reflect on the values of respect, dignity, and equality that should be afforded to all individuals, regardless of their background.",-28.0,-42.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,530.0,-2.1,-0.07924528301886792
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, Pennsylvania Republicans are advocating for House Bill 29, legislation that would permit voter intimidation on Election Day. First introduced in June, the bill aims to empower non-residents to monitor polling places and challenge voters, raising concerns about potential disruptions to the voting process.

Critics of the bill, including Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice, have voiced strong opposition, warning that the legislation could lead to discriminatory challenges against voters. Gitlin emphasized that such actions could result in longer wait times at polling locations, creating an environment that may discourage participation in the electoral process.

The implications of House Bill 29 are particularly alarming for minority groups, who may face increased intimidation and scrutiny at the polls. The potential for voter intimidation has raised red flags among civil rights advocates, who fear that the bill could disproportionately affect those already facing barriers to voting.

Adding to the tension surrounding the bill, former President Donald Trump has publicly encouraged his supporters to monitor polling areas, alleging that the upcoming election could be rigged against him. This rhetoric has further fueled concerns about the atmosphere at polling places, as Trump's supporters may feel emboldened to challenge voters under the provisions of House Bill 29.

An amendment to the bill proposes that it would take effect immediately upon passage, rather than the standard 60-day waiting period. This expedited timeline has raised eyebrows among critics, who argue that it could hasten the implementation of potentially harmful practices just ahead of the election.

The stakes are particularly high in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that is crucial for Trump's political ambitions. With the race expected to be closely contested, the introduction of voter intimidation tactics could have significant ramifications for the election outcome. Observers worry that if House Bill 29 is successful, it could set a precedent for similar measures in other states, further eroding the integrity of the electoral process.

As the debate over House Bill 29 continues, the potential for voter intimidation looms large, raising questions about the future of fair and accessible elections in Pennsylvania and beyond. Advocates for voting rights are mobilizing to combat the bill, urging lawmakers to consider the long-term consequences of allowing such practices to take root.

The situation remains fluid, with both supporters and opponents of the bill gearing up for a contentious battle in the coming weeks. As Election Day approaches, the eyes of the nation will be on Pennsylvania, where the outcome could shape the political landscape for years to come. The push for House Bill 29 serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by voters and the importance of safeguarding the democratic process against intimidation and discrimination. 

In a climate where every vote counts, the implications of this legislation could resonate far beyond Pennsylvania's borders, potentially influencing electoral strategies and voter engagement across the country. As the debate unfolds, the fundamental question remains: how can we ensure that every eligible voter feels safe and empowered to exercise their right to vote?",-19.0,-19.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,572.0,-0.95,-0.033216783216783216

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an American Olympian fencer, made history as the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab. Her groundbreaking achievement has not only inspired many but also brought to light the challenges faced by Muslim women in the United States. Despite her success, Muhammad has expressed feelings of insecurity, recounting a troubling incident where an individual followed her home with the intent to report her to the police. This experience underscores the ongoing struggles against prejudice and discrimination that many face in their daily lives.

In her reflections, Muhammad highlighted the severity of racist incidents that have occurred in the U.S., drawing attention to the tragic shooting in North Carolina and the negative rhetoric surrounding the Khan family during the Democratic National Convention. These events serve as stark reminders of the challenges that marginalized communities continue to confront.

While some may label America as an ""Islamophobic"" country, the article presents a counterargument, noting that hate crimes against Jews occur at a higher rate than those against Muslims. This statistic raises questions about the broader context of discrimination and the complexities of societal issues in America.

The article further probes Muhammad's decision to remain in the United States, questioning why she continues to live in a country she perceives as so terrible. It suggests that conditions in many Muslim-majority countries may be far worse, prompting a reflection on the freedoms and safety that America offers. The potential dangers faced in some Muslim countries, including stoning, genital mutilation, and harsh punishments for crimes, starkly contrast with the liberties Muhammad enjoys in the U.S.

As Ibtihaj Muhammad continues to break barriers in sports and advocate for change, her story serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience of individuals facing adversity. Her journey not only highlights the importance of representation but also calls for a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding race, religion, and identity in America today.",-23.0,-14.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,364.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.038461538461538464
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In recent days, protests in Charlotte have escalated into riots, following a shooting incident involving a black police officer and a black individual. What began as a demonstration has devolved into a scene of chaos, raising serious questions about the motivations and actions of those involved. The situation has sparked outrage, not only among law enforcement but also within the broader community, as the protests have taken a violent turn that many deem unjustifiable.

Critics of the protests have labeled the demonstrators as ""thugs,"" arguing that their actions are causing unnecessary chaos and destruction. This sentiment is echoed by numerous observers who have witnessed the events unfold. Instead of fostering dialogue and understanding, the protests have become a platform for violence and disorder, undermining the very message that some claim to support.

One particularly disturbing incident highlights the troubling behavior of some protesters. During the riots, a group of individuals was seen mocking an injured police officer rather than offering assistance. This shocking display of disrespect not only reflects poorly on those involved but also raises questions about the values being promoted within the movement. Such actions are not only irresponsible but also indicative of a deeper issue within the protests themselves.

The author of this article expresses a strong disdain for the actions of the protesters, characterizing them as irresponsible and violent. The argument is made that if the Black Lives Matter movement genuinely cared about black lives, its supporters would not resort to violence against one another during protests. This contradiction raises critical questions about the true intentions behind the demonstrations and the effectiveness of the movement in advocating for change.

Furthermore, the article generalizes negative traits to supporters of Black Lives Matter, suggesting that many are uneducated and prone to violence. This sweeping characterization serves to undermine the legitimacy of the movement and its goals, painting a picture of a group that is more interested in chaos than constructive dialogue. Such generalizations, while controversial, reflect a growing frustration among those who believe that the movement has strayed from its original purpose.

The condemnation of the Black Lives Matter movement is strong, with the author asserting that its actions reflect poorly on the black community as a whole. This perspective suggests that the behavior exhibited during the protests is not just an isolated incident but rather indicative of broader societal issues that need to be addressed. The author argues that the actions of a few can tarnish the reputation of many, and it is essential for individuals to be held accountable for their behavior.

In a society that values individual actions over race, the author emphasizes the importance of judging people based on their conduct rather than their skin color. This stance is particularly relevant in the context of the protests, where the actions of some have overshadowed the voices of those genuinely seeking change. The strong anti-Black Lives Matter sentiment expressed in the article underscores a belief that the movement has lost its way, prioritizing violence over meaningful dialogue.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to unfold, it is crucial for all parties involved to reflect on the implications of their actions. The protests, which began with the intention of advocating for justice and equality, have taken a troubling turn that raises questions about the effectiveness of such demonstrations. If the goal is to promote understanding and change, it is imperative that the movement reevaluates its approach and considers the impact of its actions on the community at large.

In conclusion, the recent riots in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the Black Lives Matter movement and the broader community. As tensions rise and chaos ensues, it is essential for individuals to take a step back and consider the consequences of their actions. Only through accountability and a commitment to constructive dialogue can true progress be made in the pursuit of justice and equality for all.",-83.0,-71.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,724.0,-2.5357142857142856,-0.09806629834254144
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In a poignant farewell as the sitting President, Barack Obama delivered his final speech at the United Nations General Assembly, a moment that has ignited significant debate among critics and supporters alike. Characterized by many as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal, Obama has faced scrutiny for his policies, including the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and an increasing acceptance of refugees.

During his address, Obama advocated for a one world order and emphasized the importance of international governance. This call for global cooperation has raised eyebrows, particularly among those who believe it undermines American sovereignty. He suggested that the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms in the name of global security, a notion that has not sat well with a segment of the American populace.

While Obama underscored that the right to self-defense should remain inviolable, his remarks have drawn criticism for their perceived implications. Many Americans have expressed their discontent with his views, yet Obama remained steadfast, acknowledging the backlash but refusing to waver in his beliefs.

The speech has also highlighted the growing frustration with Obama's perceived arrogance and his unwillingness to compromise. Critics argue that his approach has contributed to the divisiveness that plagues Washington D.C. today. The expectation for cooperation among representatives seems increasingly unrealistic, as partisan lines deepen and dialogue becomes more contentious.

As Obama exits the political stage, his legacy remains a topic of heated discussion. His vision for a more interconnected world stands in stark contrast to the sentiments of those who prioritize national interests and individual freedoms. The implications of his final address will likely resonate in the political landscape for years to come, as the nation grapples with the balance between global engagement and domestic priorities.",13.0,5.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,335.0,0.38461538461538464,0.014925373134328358
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of professional football, two names stand out, albeit for different reasons: Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. Both former starting quarterbacks in the NFL, they now find themselves in a similar position as non-starters, yet their reputations and public perceptions could not be more different.

Tim Tebow is widely regarded as a respected figure, known for his strong moral compass and commitment to his beliefs. In contrast, Colin Kaepernick has often been portrayed in a less favorable light, with many viewing his actions during the National Anthem as disrespectful. This stark contrast raises questions about how athletes are perceived based on their actions and the messages they choose to convey.

Tebow recently commented on Kaepernick's National Anthem protest, emphasizing the importance of standing for one's beliefs in a manner that is respectful and constructive. He advocates for expressing convictions without alienating others, suggesting that there are appropriate ways to address social issues without resorting to divisive actions. This perspective highlights Tebow's focus on positivity and respect, qualities that have endeared him to fans and critics alike.

On the other hand, the author of this article takes a critical stance towards Kaepernick, labeling him a high-paid bench player who should reserve his protests for his personal time rather than using the platform of a national sport. This sentiment reflects a broader frustration with Kaepernick's approach, which some perceive as counterproductive to the very causes he aims to support.

The article further dismisses claims of oppression in the United States, arguing that such assertions are indicative of laziness. The author points to the presidency of Barack Obama as a significant counterpoint to the narrative of systemic oppression, suggesting that the opportunities available in the U.S. are abundant for those willing to pursue them. This perspective implies that those who claim to be oppressed are, in fact, making excuses for their own lack of ambition.

In contrast, Tebow is portrayed as a wise individual who has managed to avoid negative press while focusing on his career. His recent endeavors in baseball with the New York Mets are seen as a testament to his dedication and resilience. The hope is that Tebow will find success in this new chapter of his athletic journey, further solidifying his reputation as a role model.

As the article draws to a close, it leaves readers with a negative sentiment towards Kaepernick, suggesting that his actions have not only tarnished his image but have also detracted from the important conversations surrounding social justice. In a world where athletes wield significant influence, the paths of Tebow and Kaepernick serve as a reminder of the impact of personal choices on public perception.",-6.0,11.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,505.0,0.6111111111111112,0.02178217821782178
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

The ongoing debate surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border wall has intensified, with proponents emphasizing its role as a crucial national security measure beyond merely curbing illegal immigration. Historical parallels are drawn to China's Great Wall, originally constructed to fend off foreign invaders rather than immigrants, underscoring the wall's intended purpose in safeguarding the nation.

The current landscape along the southern border is fraught with challenges, particularly due to the pervasive influence of drug cartels in Mexico. These criminal organizations have contributed to alarming death tolls, raising concerns about the safety and security of U.S. citizens. The unsecured southern border is not only a conduit for illegal immigration but also poses a significant risk for terrorist groups, including ISIS, to infiltrate the United States.

Recent events have highlighted these vulnerabilities. In a troubling incident, eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally cross into the U.S. from Mexico. They were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, a critical point of entry that has become a focal point for border security discussions. Reports from unnamed federal agents and Border Patrol Council President Hector Garza shed light on the incident, emphasizing the ongoing challenges faced by border enforcement agencies.

Garza has voiced serious concerns regarding the Border Patrol's capacity to manage security effectively. He pointed out that a substantial percentage of individuals apprehended while attempting to enter the U.S. illegally are not deported, which raises questions about the efficacy of current border enforcement strategies. This situation underscores the urgent need for stronger border security measures and increased support for Border Patrol agents who are on the front lines of this ongoing battle.

In light of these challenges, the call for enhanced border security has gained traction, with a notable Presidential candidate pledging to prioritize this issue. The candidate's commitment to bolstering border security resonates with many who believe that a secure border is essential for national safety and the protection of American citizens.

As the debate continues, the border wall remains a symbol of the broader struggle to balance immigration control with national security. The recent incidents serve as a stark reminder of the complexities involved in securing the nation's borders and the pressing need for comprehensive solutions that address both security and humanitarian concerns.",-13.0,-7.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,422.0,-0.4375,-0.016587677725118485

These people LOVED Trump. They cheered for him, he sat quietly as they told their stories.

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

In a recent gathering, a group of Haitians in the audience expressed their support for former President Donald Trump, cheering enthusiastically and sharing personal experiences that highlighted their sentiments. However, the media's early departure from the event meant they missed crucial stories from the audience, including significant complaints directed at the Clintons.

Attendees voiced their frustrations regarding the perceived neglect of Haiti by the Clintons, particularly after substantial funds were allocated for the country. Many in the audience alleged that money intended for the impoverished nation failed to reach those in need, instead benefiting Washington lobbyists and the White House. This sentiment was echoed by claims that Hillary Clinton actively opposed raising Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5, further fueling discontent among the audience.

The media's decision to leave before hearing these critical narratives was noted, with sources suggesting that the lack of negative news regarding Trump may have influenced their early exit. This has raised questions about the media's commitment to covering all perspectives, particularly those that challenge prevailing narratives.

The event concluded with a pointed critique of the media's actions, highlighting a growing concern among the audience about the representation of their voices and experiences. As the conversation around Haiti continues, the disconnect between the media and the stories of those directly affected remains a pressing issue.",-2.0,-9.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,262.0,-1.0,-0.03435114503816794
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate of heightened concern over terrorism, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reignited a contentious debate by proposing a ban on Muslim immigration until a better understanding of terrorism can be achieved. This proposal has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who have labeled it as racist. However, a closer examination reveals that racism pertains to race, not religion, suggesting that the discourse surrounding this issue may be mischaracterized.

The article posits that Islam, as a religion, has elements that can lead to radicalization, citing various extremist actions that have occurred globally. This perspective has found resonance among a significant portion of the Australian populace, as evidenced by a recent poll indicating that 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration. This figure marks a notable increase from just 28% in October of the previous year, highlighting a shift in public sentiment.

The poll further reveals that 48% of voters are in favor of initiating a national debate on the topic, suggesting a growing willingness to engage in discussions that many may have previously avoided. This sentiment is echoed by two-thirds of Australians who believe that populist senator Pauline Hanson addresses issues that other politicians tend to sidestep. Hanson's outspoken views on immigration and national security have struck a chord with many voters, reflecting a desire for more direct conversations about pressing societal concerns.

The primary motivations behind the support for a ban on Muslim immigration appear to stem from fears of terrorism and apprehensions regarding the integration of Muslim migrants into Australian society. The poll indicates that support for ending Muslim migration is particularly strong among right-wing Coalition voters, with 60% in favor. Additionally, 40% of Labour voters and 34% of Green voters also express support for the ban, suggesting that the issue transcends traditional party lines and resonates across a broader spectrum of the electorate.

The pollster behind the survey expressed surprise at the significant level of support for the ban, indicating that it reflects a deeper societal concern regarding national security and cultural integration. This growing sentiment may signal a shift in how Australians perceive immigration and its implications for the country's future.

In the context of this debate, the article critiques the approach taken by political figures such as Hillary Clinton, who have opposed views like Trump's without acknowledging the underlying fears and concerns that drive such opinions. The article argues that recognizing and addressing differing perspectives may be a more effective strategy in fostering constructive dialogue and understanding among the electorate.

As the conversation around Muslim immigration continues to evolve, it is clear that the Australian public is increasingly willing to confront these complex issues head-on. The rise in support for a ban on Muslim immigration, coupled with a desire for national debate, underscores the importance of engaging with the concerns of citizens in a thoughtful and respectful manner.

In conclusion, the proposal for a ban on Muslim immigration, while controversial, has sparked a significant shift in public opinion in Australia. As the nation grapples with the implications of this issue, it remains essential for political leaders to navigate the conversation with sensitivity and an openness to diverse viewpoints. The future of immigration policy in Australia may very well depend on the ability to balance national security concerns with the values of inclusivity and understanding that define the nation.",2.0,14.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,627.0,0.6666666666666666,0.022328548644338118

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a shocking turn of events, a chaotic incident unfolded in the middle of a street, where a fight was anticipated. What began as a typical altercation quickly escalated into a disturbing scene when an individual unexpectedly set those involved in the fight on fire. Eyewitnesses described the atmosphere as chaotic, with people running in all directions, desperately trying to avoid being struck by oncoming vehicles.

The incident has drawn significant attention, particularly due to claims made by Buzzfeed that the description of the crime and its victims was false. However, these assertions have been debunked by the original source, reaffirming the gravity of the situation. The author of the report expressed deep concern over the mindset of the individual who threw the Molotov cocktail, suggesting that such an act indicates a level of premeditation that is both alarming and troubling.

Reflecting on the incident, the author contrasts the current behavior of bystanders with a nostalgic view of the past. There was once a time when individuals would intervene to prevent harm during fights, stepping in to protect those in danger. This sense of community and responsibility appears to have diminished, replaced by a modern tendency to record events for viral content rather than offering assistance to those in peril.

The chaotic scene not only highlights the dangers of violence but also raises critical questions about societal values. In an age where social media often takes precedence over human compassion, the author calls for a renewed commitment to caring for one another. The need for individuals to step up and intervene in dangerous situations is more pressing than ever, as the consequences of inaction can be dire.

As the community grapples with the aftermath of this disturbing incident, it serves as a stark reminder of the importance of empathy and responsibility. The author urges everyone to reflect on their actions and consider how they can contribute to a safer environment. It is essential to foster a culture that prioritizes human life over the fleeting allure of online fame.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- A border wall is deemed necessary not only to prevent illegal immigration but also to secure access points into America.

Luna County, New Mexico, is on high alert following a recent traffic stop that involved an undocumented woman from the Middle East. The woman, described as an ""Islamic refugee,"" was found with detailed plans for a gas pipeline in Deming, New Mexico, raising significant concerns about potential terrorist intentions.

Law enforcement officials are particularly wary, as the presence of an undocumented Muslim woman in a border county has intensified fears of possible threats. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, along with U.S. Border Patrol, promptly investigated the area but reported no immediate threats. However, the remote location of the pipeline has led to speculation that the woman may have been scouting for future terror attacks rather than planning an immediate assault.

The situation has reignited discussions about the necessity of a border wall, which many argue is essential not only to prevent illegal immigration but also to secure access points into America. Advocates for the wall point to a 2015 report by Judicial Watch, which indicated a troubling collaboration between Mexican cartels and terror organizations. This report highlighted how cartels have been involved in smuggling individuals from terror-afflicted nations into the United States.

Further compounding these concerns, a 2017 report revealed that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border to scout potential targets. These findings have led to calls for Congress to approve funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall, which supporters argue is crucial for preventing entry by terrorists and drug cartels.

The narrative surrounding illegal immigration has evolved, with many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. not solely from Mexico but from further south, often with the support of the Mexican government. This shift underscores the argument that terrorists could exploit the southern border to gain entry into the United States, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced border security measures.

As the investigation into the undocumented woman continues, the community remains on edge, grappling with the implications of her actions and the broader security challenges facing the nation. The call for a fortified border wall resonates strongly among those who believe that such measures are vital for safeguarding the country from foreign threats. The situation in Luna County serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration, national security, and the ongoing debate over how best to protect the United States from potential dangers.",-44.0,-37.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,447.0,-2.466666666666667,-0.08277404921700224
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a world where the pressures of fame and success often overshadow personal values, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out as a beacon of hope and integrity. Wilson, known for his impressive skills on the football field, emphasizes a profound love for God and a commitment to helping others. His mission transcends the game, as he aims to serve and change lives, aspiring to leave a legacy filled with joy.

On the field, Wilson is laser-focused on winning, a mindset that has propelled him to success in the NFL. However, his priorities shift dramatically when he steps off the gridiron. Wilson is a passionate advocate for promoting joy and peace, driven by his faith and the belief that good choices can lead to a fulfilling life. His approach to life is simple yet powerful: God first, family and friends second, and football third. Wilson firmly believes that adhering to this order not only enriches his personal life but also leads to great outcomes in all areas.

Despite the NFL's advice to refrain from discussing his faith publicly, Wilson remains undeterred. He continues to share his message through his actions, embodying the principles he holds dear. His commitment to faith is not merely a personal journey; it is a call to inspire others to embrace similar values. Wilson's determination to speak out about his beliefs highlights a growing concern regarding the freedom of expression, particularly when it comes to faith.

In a climate where many individuals in power seem to forget their roots, Wilson critiques those who use their influence for self-glorification rather than the betterment of society. He expresses concern over the corruption and deception that often permeate leadership, particularly in the current political landscape. This critique resonates with many who feel disillusioned by the actions of those in authority, prompting a broader discussion about the responsibilities that come with power.

The article also touches on a perceived double standard regarding freedom of speech. While some individuals face backlash for expressing their faith, others seem to escape scrutiny when they disrespect the country. This inconsistency raises questions about the values that society chooses to uphold and the implications for those who dare to stand for their beliefs.

Wilson's unwavering commitment to helping others raises an important question: when did the act of serving and uplifting those in need become viewed negatively? In a time when self-interest often takes precedence, Wilson's dedication to truth and righteousness serves as a reminder of the importance of compassion and integrity. His actions challenge the narrative that helping others is a liability rather than a virtue.

His legacy is not just about the touchdowns and victories; it is about the lives he touches and the hope he instills in those around him. In a world that often seems divided, Wilson's message of faith, service, and love stands as a unifying force, encouraging others to reflect on their values and the impact they can have on the world.

In conclusion, Russell Wilson exemplifies the power of faith and the importance of prioritizing what truly matters. His journey serves as a testament to the idea that success is not solely measured by accolades but by the lives we touch and the joy we spread. As he continues to champion these ideals, Wilson's legacy is sure to inspire future generations to embrace a life of purpose, service, and unwavering faith.",79.0,108.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,670.0,4.0,0.16119402985074627
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a recent address, Pope Francis delivered a poignant critique of fear-based media, equating its impact to that of terrorism. His remarks, while primarily directed at the Italian press, were intended to resonate on a global scale, particularly within the United States, where fear and anxiety have become increasingly prevalent.

The Pope emphasized the dangers of journalism rooted in gossip and rumors, asserting that such practices can inflict significant harm on both individuals and society as a whole. He underscored the responsibility of the media to provide accurate and constructive information, rather than sensationalized narratives that foster fear and division.

Referencing a famous quote from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Pope highlighted the destructive nature of fear-mongering, stating, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” This historical perspective serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of allowing fear to dominate public discourse. Despite a notable decrease in crime rates, many Americans report feeling increasingly fearful, with recent polls indicating heightened concerns about terrorism and crime.

The article draws attention to the role of media outlets, particularly Fox News, in shaping public perception and contributing to this climate of fear. Critics argue that the network's focus on sensational stories and alarming headlines has exacerbated feelings of insecurity among viewers. As reports of terrorist attacks and mass shootings become more frequent, a pervasive sense of disorder has taken hold, further fueling public anxiety.

Pope Francis's comments serve as a call to action for journalists and media organizations to reflect on their practices and the potential consequences of their reporting. By prioritizing accuracy and responsible journalism, the media can play a crucial role in alleviating fear rather than amplifying it. The Pope's message resonates with the need for a more compassionate and truthful approach to news reporting, one that seeks to inform rather than incite panic.

As the world grapples with various challenges, including political unrest and social upheaval, the Pope's critique of fear-based media is a timely reminder of the power of words and the responsibility that comes with them. In an era where misinformation can spread rapidly, the call for integrity in journalism is more important than ever.

In conclusion, Pope Francis's remarks highlight the urgent need for a shift in media practices, urging journalists to move away from fear-driven narratives and towards a more constructive and truthful approach. As society continues to navigate complex issues, fostering a sense of hope and understanding may be the key to overcoming the pervasive fear that has taken root in many communities.",-56.0,-43.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,483.0,-2.6875,-0.08902691511387163
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and

However, other snap polls from various sources, including TIME Magazine, Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville, present a more mixed picture, with some suggesting Trump may have the edge.

Key topics during the debate included the Birther movement, the ongoing email controversy surrounding Clinton, and questions regarding Trump’s tax returns. These issues have been pivotal in shaping the candidates' narratives as they vie for voter support. Despite Clinton's strong showing in CNN's poll, the validity of the results has been called into question due to the poll's Democrat-leaning sample pool. This has led to skepticism about whether Clinton's perceived win will translate into increased voter turnout.

In response to the polling results, Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude to his supporters for their favorable responses. Meanwhile, Clinton has yet to comment on the debate or the polling outcomes. Trump's campaign has also been marked by controversy, as he criticized the media for allegedly providing him with a defective microphone during the debate. He further suggested that he should have brought up Bill Clinton's infidelity, indicating a strategy to shift focus onto his opponent's past.

As the election date approaches, both candidates are acutely aware of the limited time they have to sway undecided voters. The stakes are high, and every debate and poll could play a crucial role in shaping the final outcome. Adding to the tension, Julian Assange has hinted at an October surprise release on Wikileaks that could potentially impact Clinton's campaign, leaving many to speculate about the implications of such a revelation.

With the political landscape rapidly evolving, the debate results and subsequent polling will undoubtedly continue to be a focal point in the lead-up to the election.",18.0,-3.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,391.0,-0.2,-0.0076726342710997444
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

In the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, Hillary Clinton declared victory, but the public's response paints a more complex picture. Focus groups conducted by both Fox News and CNN revealed a significant divide in perceptions of the debate's outcome. CNN's focus group, comprised of Florida voters, reported an overwhelming 18-2 split in favor of Clinton, while Fox News's group from Pennsylvania showed a more modest 16-6 advantage for the former Secretary of State.

Pollster Frank Luntz, who analyzed the debate, noted that while Trump struggled to articulate his tax policies, he found his footing when discussing Clinton's email scandal. However, Trump's performance was not without controversy. He faced considerable backlash for revisiting his long-debunked questioning of President Obama's birthplace, which many viewed as a misstep.

Despite the focus group results favoring Clinton, a separate poll indicated a stark contrast, showing Trump leading with a staggering 92% to Clinton's 8%. This discrepancy has left many analysts puzzled about the true impact of the debate on voter sentiment.

Following Clinton's declaration of victory on social media, a wave of backlash ensued, with the hashtag #TrumpWon trending globally. Critics have pointed out Clinton's pattern of avoiding media engagements after debates, raising questions about her strategy and willingness to engage with opposing viewpoints.

As the election season heats up, the debate's aftermath highlights the complexities of public perception and the challenges both candidates face in swaying undecided voters. While Clinton may have claimed victory in the immediate aftermath, the mixed reactions and contrasting poll results suggest that the debate's impact on the overall race remains uncertain. As both campaigns move forward, the focus will undoubtedly shift to how each candidate addresses the issues raised during the debate and the narratives that emerge in the coming weeks.",18.0,10.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,350.0,0.7692307692307693,0.02857142857142857
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted in Charlotte for the second consecutive night in response to the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, a tragic event that has ignited outrage and calls for justice across the city. The protests, which began peacefully with approximately 1,000 participants chanting ""Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,"" quickly escalated into chaos, culminating in a civilian being shot in the head and critically injured during the demonstrations.

The atmosphere was charged as protesters gathered to voice their anger and grief over Scott's death, which has been described as another instance of police violence against African-Americans. However, the situation took a dangerous turn when riot police arrived on the scene, leading to heightened tensions and a rapid escalation of the protests.

Eyewitness accounts of the shooting incident that left a civilian critically injured have raised serious questions about the official narrative provided by law enforcement. While police claimed that the shooter was a civilian, multiple eyewitnesses have contradicted this assertion, suggesting that the shot may have originated from law enforcement officers present at the protest.

Todd Zimmer, an eyewitness to the events, took to Twitter to express his disbelief at the police's version of events, stating, ""The city is lying about the incident."" His comments reflect a growing sentiment among protesters and community members who feel that the truth is being obscured by official statements.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, corroborated Zimmer's account, noting that he heard a gunshot that did not sound like a typical firearm. This observation has led many to speculate about the type of weapon used during the incident, with some eyewitnesses suggesting that rubber bullets may have been deployed by law enforcement.

As the protests continued, the City of Charlotte quickly issued a statement asserting that the shooting was a result of civilian-on-civilian violence. However, this claim has been met with skepticism, as additional eyewitness reports have emerged that contradict the police narrative. Many participants in the protest described the shooting as an ""ambush,"" indicating that they believe it was likely caused by police actions rather than a confrontation between civilians.

The incident has drawn attention to the ongoing violence faced by African-Americans during protests against state violence, a theme that has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. The protests in Charlotte are part of a larger movement calling for accountability and justice in the wake of police killings, and the events of the past two nights have only intensified these demands.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to unfold, community leaders and activists are calling for a thorough investigation into the shooting and the circumstances surrounding Kenneth L. Scott's death. The protests serve as a reminder of the deep-seated issues of racial injustice and police violence that persist in many communities across the United States.

In the wake of these events, the city faces mounting pressure to address the concerns of its residents and to ensure that justice is served for Kenneth L. Scott and all those affected by police violence. The protests are not just a response to a single incident; they represent a broader struggle for equality and justice that resonates with many across the nation.

As the protests enter their third night, the eyes of the nation are on Charlotte, where the fight for justice continues to unfold amidst a backdrop of tension and uncertainty. The voices of the protesters, demanding accountability and change, echo the sentiments of countless others who have taken to the streets in cities across the country, united in their call for an end to systemic violence and oppression.

The events in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead in the pursuit of justice and equality. As the community grapples with the aftermath of the protests and the tragic loss of Kenneth L. Scott, the need for dialogue, understanding, and meaningful change has never been more urgent.",-74.0,-86.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,736.0,-3.739130434782609,-0.11684782608695653
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, finds himself at the center of a growing controversy regarding his foreign policy and its apparent alignment with Russian interests. Critics have raised alarms over Trump's connections to the Kremlin and the implications these ties may have for U.S. foreign policy should he return to the White House.

Trump has been accused of fostering relationships with individuals linked to the Russian government, raising questions about his commitment to American interests. His campaign has received notable support from Russian state-controlled media and intelligence services, further complicating the narrative surrounding his foreign policy stance. This support has led to concerns that Trump may prioritize his personal relationships over the strategic interests of the United States.

In a bid to distance himself from allegations of impropriety, Trump has publicly asserted that he has “ZERO investments in Russia.” However, an investigation conducted by ABC News has uncovered a different reality, revealing that Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in business dealings. This discrepancy between Trump's claims and the findings of the investigation has fueled skepticism among voters and political analysts alike.

The investigation highlights Trump's profitable ventures with Russian oligarchs, who have been instrumental in his business dealings. Notably, Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow, a high-profile event that not only showcased his brand but also solidified his connections within Russian elite circles. Additionally, he has engaged in real estate transactions with Russian buyers, further intertwining his financial interests with those of the Russian oligarchs.

Russian oligarchs, who amassed their wealth during the transition to a free-market economy in Russia, have been known to leverage their influence to support President Vladimir Putin while simultaneously enriching themselves. This dynamic raises significant concerns about the motivations behind their financial dealings with Trump. Purchasing properties owned by Trump has emerged as a favored method for these oligarchs to launder money out of Russia, a practice that could have serious implications for U.S. national security.

Former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev has characterized Russian oligarchs as materialistic and culturally ignorant, suggesting that their motivations are primarily driven by financial gain rather than any allegiance to democratic values. This characterization adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing debate about Trump's foreign policy and his connections to these influential figures.

In 2014, the United States imposed sanctions on Russian oligarchs in response to the annexation of Crimea, a move aimed at curtailing their financial activities and holding them accountable for their actions. However, Trump has suggested that he would reconsider these sanctions if elected, a statement that has raised eyebrows among critics who fear potential conflicts of interest between his personal finances and U.S. foreign policy.

The prospect of Trump re-entering the White House with such connections has led to warnings about the potential for corruption at the highest levels of government. Critics argue that allowing Trump and his associates to influence U.S. foreign policy could undermine the integrity of American democracy and lead to a foreign policy that prioritizes personal gain over national interests.

As the election draws nearer, the implications of Trump's foreign policy and his ties to Russian interests will likely remain a focal point of discussion among voters and political commentators. The concerns surrounding his connections to the Kremlin and the potential for conflicts of interest are not merely political talking points; they represent a significant challenge to the integrity of U.S. governance.

In conclusion, the scrutiny surrounding Donald Trump's foreign policy and his connections to Russian oligarchs raises critical questions about the future of American leadership. As voters prepare to make their choice in the upcoming election, the potential ramifications of Trump's ties to Russia will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and influencing the political landscape. The stakes are high, and the need for transparency and accountability has never been more pressing.",27.0,10.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,728.0,0.4166666666666667,0.013736263736263736
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing the looming threat of impeachment as state legislators weigh the possibility of filing articles against him in connection with the infamous ""Bridgegate"" scandal. The controversy centers around allegations that Christie orchestrated the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge as a form of political retribution against a rival, leading to significant traffic disruptions and even a tragic death due to delayed emergency services.

The potential for impeachment is being considered by top state legislators, who are closely monitoring the developments in the ongoing legal proceedings related to the scandal. If Christie is found guilty of orchestrating the bridge closures, Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto will have the authority to decide whether to move forward with the impeachment process. Should Prieto approve, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would initiate the proceedings.

For impeachment to proceed, a majority of the 80-member Assembly must vote in favor, followed by a two-thirds vote in the Senate for a conviction. This complex political process underscores the gravity of the situation for Christie, who has seen his political standing decline significantly in recent years.

Adding to the pressure, a judge has recently ordered Christie to produce personal emails related to the Bridgegate scandal, which could provide further insight into his involvement. Federal prosecutors have already implicated Christie in the ongoing trial of three senior aides, accusing him of being part of the political retribution plot that led to the bridge closures. The ramifications of these allegations are profound, as they not only threaten Christie's governorship but also his role as the chairperson of Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump’s transition team.

The Bridgegate scandal first emerged in January 2014, when Christie publicly denied any knowledge of the lane closures during a press conference. However, revelations have since surfaced indicating that he was informed about the situation during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 but failed to take any action. This has raised serious questions about his leadership and accountability.

The scandal has had far-reaching consequences, not only for the individuals directly involved but also for Christie's political future. Once viewed as a potential leader of the Republican Party, Christie’s reputation has suffered significantly as a result of the ongoing controversy. His endorsement of Donald Trump in March 2016 marked a pivotal moment in his political career, but the implications of the Bridgegate scandal continue to overshadow his contributions to the party.

As the situation unfolds, the eyes of New Jersey residents and political observers alike are fixed on the actions of the state legislature. The decision to pursue impeachment could set a precedent for how political misconduct is addressed in the future, particularly in a climate where accountability is increasingly demanded from public officials.

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a heated Republican primary debate in September 2015, Donald Trump made a bold assertion regarding his past interactions with Jeb Bush concerning casino gambling in Florida. Trump claimed he never lobbied Bush for the introduction of casino gambling, stating emphatically, “If I wanted it, I would have gotten it.” This statement, however, raises significant questions about the veracity of Trump's claims, particularly in light of his previous admissions during a 2007 deposition where he acknowledged that he did, in fact, push for casino gambling in the state.

The contradiction between Trump's statements during the debate and his earlier deposition creates a complex narrative that suggests either a deliberate falsehood during the debate or potential perjury in the deposition. This inconsistency is not merely a matter of political rhetoric; it touches on the serious implications of honesty and integrity in public office.

During the debate, Trump’s narrative directly contradicted Bush's assertion that Trump had sought to influence him through campaign contributions. Bush maintained that Trump had indeed attempted to sway him regarding the legalization of casino gambling, a claim that Trump vehemently denied. This exchange not only highlights a personal dispute between the two political figures but also underscores a broader conflict over the introduction of casino gambling in Florida, a contentious issue that has long divided state politics.

The implications of Trump's statements extend beyond mere political posturing. The article draws a parallel between Trump's situation and the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced serious consequences for lying under oath. Clinton's impeachment was rooted in the principle that dishonesty, particularly in legal contexts, undermines the integrity of the office and the trust of the public. Similarly, if Trump is found to have lied during the debate or committed perjury in his deposition, it raises profound questions about his fitness for office and the potential ramifications for national safety.

The debate exchange serves as a critical moment in understanding the dynamics of Trump's political strategy. His tendency to distort the truth has been a hallmark of his public persona, and this incident is no exception. The potential dangers of such dishonesty are not to be underestimated; when a leader is willing to manipulate facts for personal gain, it poses a risk not only to the political landscape but also to the safety and security of the nation.

To illustrate the conflicting statements made by Trump, the article includes transcripts from both the debate and the 2007 deposition. In the deposition, Trump stated, “I was pushing for casino gambling in Florida. I thought it was a good idea.” This admission starkly contrasts with his debate claim, where he insisted, “I never lobbied Jeb Bush for casino gambling.” The discrepancies between these statements are not merely semantic; they reflect a deeper issue of accountability and transparency in leadership.

The call to action for Congress to consider impeachment based on Trump's alleged crimes is a significant aspect of the discussion. The notion that a sitting president could face impeachment for dishonesty is a serious matter that speaks to the foundational principles of American democracy. The integrity of the office must be upheld, and any actions that undermine that integrity warrant scrutiny and potential consequences.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Trump's statements and the surrounding controversy will likely remain a focal point of discussion. The questions raised by his claims about casino gambling in Florida are emblematic of larger issues regarding truthfulness in politics and the responsibilities of public officials to their constituents.

In conclusion, the debate exchange between Trump and Bush serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing American politics today. The potential for dishonesty and manipulation of facts poses a significant threat to the democratic process and the trust that citizens place in their leaders. As the nation grapples with these issues, the importance of accountability and integrity in public office cannot be overstated. The call for Congress to take action in response to Trump's alleged dishonesty is a reminder that the principles of truth and transparency must remain at the forefront of political discourse.",-29.0,-21.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,779.0,-0.8076923076923077,-0.026957637997432605
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a drinking game during a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN.

- The Surgeon General cautioned that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related issues following the debate.
- Viewers are advised to drink responsibly during upcoming debates, with a suggestion for ""baby sips"" for Trump's lies.","**Surgeon General Warns Against Drinking Games During CNN Debate**

In a striking reminder of the potential dangers associated with drinking games, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a warning ahead of a recent 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN. Many viewers engaged in a drinking game, taking a sip every time former President Donald Trump made a false statement. However, Murthy cautioned that such behavior could lead to serious health risks, including alcohol poisoning.

The Surgeon General's concerns are not unfounded. In 2012, there were approximately 70,000 incidents of alcohol poisoning linked to drinking games during political debates. With the current Republican candidates, Murthy emphasized the need for caution, particularly given Trump's history of misleading statements. Prior to the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton on September 26, 2016, Murthy had already reiterated the dangers of drinking in response to Trump's frequent untruths.

A recent study by Politico highlighted the extent of Trump's fabrications, revealing that he told 87 lies over a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, averaging a lie every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Based on this average, it is estimated that Trump likely made around 28 false statements during the CNN debate, raising concerns about the potential for viewers to overindulge in alcohol consumption.

In light of these statistics, Murthy warned that first responders were on alert for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate. He urged viewers to drink responsibly, suggesting a more measured approach, such as taking ""baby sips"" when Trump lies, to mitigate the risks associated with excessive drinking.

As political debates continue to draw large audiences, the Surgeon General's warning serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of moderation. With the potential for high-stakes drinking games, viewers are encouraged to prioritize their health and safety while engaging in political discourse. The upcoming debates will undoubtedly attract attention, but it is essential for participants to remain mindful of the risks associated with drinking games, especially in the context of the current political climate.",-17.0,-15.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,379.0,-1.0714285714285714,-0.0395778364116095
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the wake of a recent debate, mainstream media outlets have widely declared Hillary Clinton the victor, praising her performance and articulating a strong case for her candidacy. However, a stark contrast emerged from the online sphere, where polls and social media trends suggested a different narrative. The hashtag #TrumpWon surged in popularity across Twitter, indicating a significant portion of the public felt otherwise.

Interestingly, the hashtag #TrumpWon has been traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia, raising concerns about the origins of this online sentiment. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has been known to employ cyber-trolls as part of a broader strategy to promote disinformation campaigns that serve his political agenda. This tactic is designed to create discord and amplify divisions among U.S. allies, further complicating the already polarized political landscape.

In addition to the online discourse, Russian state-controlled media has been actively promoting Donald Trump to European audiences, suggesting a concerted effort to influence perceptions of the U.S. political climate. Analysts believe that Putin's ultimate goal is to manipulate Trump into lifting the economic sanctions that were imposed following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. This manipulation could have far-reaching implications for international relations and the stability of the region.

Reports from former bloggers who have worked in this environment describe their conditions as harsh, with strict oversight and penalties for performance. These accounts highlight the lengths to which the Russian government will go to ensure that its narrative is disseminated effectively, often at the expense of truth and transparency.

Given the complexities of online interactions, experts are warning the public against placing undue trust in online polls and engaging with potential Russian trolls. The digital landscape can be a breeding ground for misinformation, and discerning fact from fiction is increasingly challenging.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call to action for Congress to consider impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. Advocates argue that the influence of foreign entities in U.S. politics poses a significant threat to democracy and must be addressed decisively.

Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor. The lawsuit alleges that the company has engaged in systematic discrimination against Asian job applicants during its hiring process, raising significant concerns about the fairness and integrity of its employment practices.

As a contractor for the federal government, including agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA), Palantir is expected to adhere to strict non-discriminatory hiring standards. However, the lawsuit highlights troubling statistics regarding the company's hiring practices for engineering intern positions. According to the allegations, out of 130 applicants for these roles, a striking 73% were Asian. Yet, the hiring outcomes reveal a stark disparity: only four Asian candidates were selected for the positions, compared to 17 non-Asian hires. This discrepancy raises serious questions about the company's commitment to equitable hiring practices.

The Department of Labor's lawsuit underscores the improbability of such hiring outcomes occurring by chance, estimating the likelihood of this result at one in a billion. This statistic serves to bolster the claims of discrimination, suggesting that the hiring process at Palantir may be influenced by biases that disproportionately affect Asian applicants.

Peter Thiel, who has been a significant figure in the tech industry as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has a complex public persona. A first-generation immigrant himself, Thiel has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, who has taken a hardline stance against immigration. This juxtaposition of Thiel's background and his political affiliations adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing lawsuit, as it raises questions about the values and practices within the company he controls.

Thiel is also known for his controversial actions outside of his business ventures, including funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, which ultimately led to the bankruptcy of the site. His public persona was further solidified when he made history as the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention. During his speech, Thiel expressed pride in his identity while simultaneously criticizing government incompetence. However, the Republican Party adopted an anti-LGBT platform during the same convention, highlighting the contradictions within the party's stance on social issues.

The Department of Labor's lawsuit serves as a reminder that federal contractors like Palantir are required to maintain non-discriminatory hiring practices. The implications of this lawsuit could be significant, not only for Palantir but also for the broader tech industry, which has faced increasing scrutiny over diversity and inclusion in recent years.

In response to the allegations, a spokeswoman for Palantir stated that the company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims made by the Department of Labor. The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching consequences for Palantir, particularly as it seeks to maintain its status as a trusted contractor for federal agencies.

As the case unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor how Palantir addresses these allegations and whether any changes are made to its hiring practices in light of the scrutiny. The tech industry as a whole is at a crossroads, with increasing pressure to ensure that diversity and inclusion are prioritized in hiring processes. The outcome of this lawsuit may serve as a pivotal moment for Palantir and could influence how other companies approach their own employment practices.

In conclusion, the federal lawsuit against Palantir Technologies raises serious questions about the company's hiring practices and its commitment to non-discrimination. As the case progresses, it will be essential to observe the implications for both Palantir and the broader tech industry, particularly in the context of ongoing discussions about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. The stakes are high, and the outcome could set important precedents for how companies navigate these critical issues in the future.",-18.0,-21.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,715.0,-0.8076923076923077,-0.02937062937062937

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Authorities are actively pursuing leads in connection with the Chelsea bombing that took place last Saturday, injuring 29 individuals. The incident has raised significant concerns about public safety and the potential for further attacks, prompting a thorough investigation by law enforcement.

In a critical development, a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster located just four blocks away from the site of the initial explosion. This discovery has heightened fears and underscored the urgency of the investigation as police work to determine whether the two incidents are linked.

Three significant leads have emerged in the ongoing investigation, each providing potential insights into the motives and identity of the perpetrator. 

The first lead involves a hand-written letter that was found alongside the second bomb. This letter, which is partially written in Arabic, could offer crucial clues regarding the bomber's intentions and background. Authorities are currently analyzing the contents of the letter to decipher its meaning and relevance to the case.

The second lead comes from an unidentified male caller who contacted 911 to issue a chilling warning about potential further explosions. The caller ominously stated, “There will be more,” raising alarms among law enforcement and the public alike. This warning has prompted police to increase their vigilance and preparedness for any additional threats.

The third lead is a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ which claims to serve as the bomber's manifesto. The page expresses grievances related to various societal issues, including the oppression of the LGBTQ+ community and other forms of inequality. The individual behind the Tumblr post has taken responsibility for the explosions, indicating that their actions are motivated by a desire to draw attention to these perceived injustices.

In a particularly alarming statement, the individual asserts, “This is not the end, this is just the beginning,” suggesting a willingness to continue their campaign of violence. This declaration has raised concerns among law enforcement officials about the potential for further attacks and the need for heightened security measures in the area.

Despite the gravity of these claims, there is a growing skepticism regarding the authenticity of the statements made on the Tumblr page. Some experts and officials have expressed concerns that individuals may be attempting to exploit the situation for notoriety or attention, casting doubt on whether the claims are genuinely linked to the bombing incidents.

As the investigation unfolds, police are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. The community is on high alert, with many residents expressing fear and uncertainty in the wake of the attacks. Local businesses and organizations are also taking precautions to ensure the safety of their patrons and employees.

In response to the bombing and the subsequent discovery of the second device, city officials are coordinating with law enforcement to enhance security measures throughout the Chelsea area. Increased police presence and surveillance efforts are being implemented to reassure the public and deter any potential threats.

As investigators continue to sift through the evidence and analyze the leads, the community remains hopeful for a swift resolution to the case. The Chelsea bombing has not only left a mark on the individuals directly affected but has also shaken the sense of safety within the broader community.

The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are committed to uncovering the truth behind these violent acts. As they work to piece together the puzzle, the public is reminded to stay alert and report any information that may assist in bringing those responsible to justice.",-25.0,-10.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,650.0,-0.37037037037037035,-0.015384615384615385
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on September 25, 2016

As Donald Trump gears up for a pivotal debate against Hillary Clinton, concerns are mounting regarding his mental state and overall readiness. At 70 years old, Trump has been relentlessly campaigning, often sacrificing rest for the sake of his political ambitions. With less than 24 hours to go before the highly anticipated face-off, signs of mental strain are becoming increasingly evident.

In a perplexing display, Trump took to Twitter to share an incoherent message that spanned three unrelated topics. The tweet referenced a tragic incident in Washington State where five individuals were killed by a Middle Eastern immigrant, drug overdoses plaguing Ohio, and riots occurring in North Carolina. This unusual combination of subjects has raised eyebrows and led many to speculate about the state of Trump's focus and mental clarity.

Observers note that the disjointed nature of the tweet may indicate that Trump is struggling to maintain a coherent line of thought, a troubling sign for someone preparing for a debate against a seasoned politician like Clinton. The ability to articulate clear and focused arguments is crucial in such high-stakes situations, and Trump's recent social media activity suggests he may be grappling with this challenge.

The implications of Trump's mental state could be significant for his campaign. As he faces off against Clinton, who is known for her political acumen and debate skills, any signs of unpreparedness or lack of focus could be detrimental. The upcoming debate is not just a test of policy positions but also a reflection of each candidate's mental fortitude and ability to engage under pressure.

As the clock ticks down to the debate, the question remains: will Trump's apparent mental strain serve as a turning point for his campaign? With the stakes higher than ever, both supporters and critics are watching closely to see how he performs in the face of mounting pressure. The outcome of this debate could very well shape the trajectory of Trump's campaign as he seeks to solidify his position in the race for the presidency.",-22.0,-8.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,392.0,-0.5714285714285714,-0.02040816326530612

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio – Hillary Clinton's recent door-knocking event, scheduled for 1 PM, was anticipated to be a rallying point for volunteers and supporters. However, the turnout was far from what her campaign had hoped for, as only one individual, a known supporter of Donald Trump, showed up to document the occasion.

The event, designed to engage local residents and galvanize grassroots support, was met with an unexpected twist when Clinton's staff recognized the Trump supporter among them. Following this realization, campaign staff members asked the individual to leave, highlighting the tense political atmosphere surrounding the event.

Despite the campaign office's preparations, which included organizing materials and setting up for a larger crowd, the reality of the situation became evident as only staff members were present. This lack of grassroots enthusiasm has raised significant concerns about the effectiveness of Clinton's campaign as the election approaches.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump's rallies have been characterized by packed venues and enthusiastic crowds, showcasing a stark divide in the current political landscape. Observers have noted that while Trump continues to draw large numbers of supporters, Clinton's campaign appears to be struggling to generate similar excitement and engagement among potential voters.

The low turnout at the door-knocking event has led to speculation about the challenges Clinton may face in the upcoming election. Analysts are questioning whether her campaign can effectively mobilize supporters and build the necessary momentum to compete against Trump, who has consistently demonstrated a strong base of support.

As the political climate intensifies, the implications of this event extend beyond just one afternoon in Ohio. The lack of grassroots support for Clinton raises alarms about her campaign's overall viability and effectiveness. With the election looming, the ability to connect with voters and inspire enthusiasm will be crucial for any candidate hoping to secure victory.

In light of these developments, political commentators are increasingly suggesting that Clinton's campaign may be in trouble. The stark contrast between her event and Trump's rallies serves as a reminder of the challenges she faces in rallying support and energizing her base. As the election season progresses, the question remains: can Clinton turn the tide and regain the enthusiasm necessary to compete effectively against her opponent?

With the political landscape shifting rapidly, the upcoming months will be critical for both candidates. Trump's potential victory is becoming a topic of serious discussion, particularly as Clinton's campaign struggles to gain traction. The door-knocking event in Delaware serves as a microcosm of the larger challenges facing Clinton as she seeks to navigate a complex and often hostile political environment.

As the election draws nearer, the stakes are high, and both campaigns will need to adapt to the evolving dynamics of voter sentiment. For Clinton, the path forward may require a reevaluation of strategies to engage supporters and build a more robust grassroots movement. The outcome of this election could hinge on her ability to inspire confidence and enthusiasm among voters, a task that has proven increasingly difficult in recent months. 

In conclusion, the door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, has illuminated the challenges facing Hillary Clinton's campaign as it grapples with low enthusiasm and support. With Donald Trump maintaining a strong presence among his supporters, the upcoming election promises to be a pivotal moment in American politics, with both candidates vying for the hearts and minds of voters across the nation.",-7.0,48.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,647.0,2.0,0.07418856259659969

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a recent bombing in New York City, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his immediate and pointed reactions. Trump, who accurately described the incident as a ""bombing,"" has found himself at the center of a media storm, particularly with CNN's response to his terminology.

CNN, in a move that has drawn criticism, took issue with Trump's choice of words. The network's coverage of the bombing notably omitted a similar description used by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who also referred to the attack as a bombing. This selective editing has raised eyebrows and sparked a debate about media bias and the integrity of news reporting.

During an interview on Fox and Friends, Trump did not hold back in his condemnation of CNN's actions. He labeled the network as ""disgusting and disgraceful,"" accusing it of dishonesty in its reporting. Trump further derided CNN as the ""Clinton news network,"" suggesting that the outlet's editorial choices are influenced by political affiliations rather than a commitment to objective journalism.

In addition to his criticisms of the media, Trump took the opportunity to address broader concerns regarding national security and terrorism. He expressed frustration with what he described as ""stupid"" leaders who have adopted a soft approach to terrorism. Trump emphasized the necessity for a tougher stance, arguing that the current leadership has failed to adequately protect the nation from threats.

A significant part of Trump's commentary focused on the issue of refugees, particularly in light of the ongoing crisis in Syria. He criticized former President Barack Obama’s plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017, asserting that such a move poses risks to national security. Trump claimed that Clinton, if elected, would seek to increase that number even further, raising alarms about the potential implications for American safety.

The former president also voiced concerns about the vetting process for incoming refugees, labeling it as inadequate. He argued that the current system does not sufficiently ensure the safety of American citizens, calling for a reevaluation of how refugees are screened before being allowed into the country.

Trump's remarks come at a time when the nation is grappling with the complexities of immigration and security. His call for a more stringent approach resonates with a segment of the population that prioritizes national security and is wary of the potential risks associated with an influx of refugees.

As the debate continues, Trump's criticisms of CNN and his calls for a tougher stance on terrorism and refugee policies are likely to fuel discussions among policymakers and the public alike. The incident in New York City has reignited conversations about how best to balance humanitarian efforts with the imperative of ensuring national security.

In the aftermath of the bombing, the political landscape remains charged, with Trump positioning himself as a vocal advocate for a more aggressive approach to combating terrorism and addressing the challenges posed by refugee resettlement. His comments reflect a broader narrative that is likely to influence the ongoing discourse surrounding these critical issues in the months to come. 

As the nation processes the implications of the bombing and the responses from various political figures, the spotlight remains on how media outlets report on such incidents and the narratives they choose to amplify. The clash between Trump and CNN serves as a reminder of the contentious relationship between politics and the media, particularly in an era where every word and action is scrutinized under the public eye.",-45.0,-21.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,661.0,-0.875,-0.03177004538577912

Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

In a surprising turn of events, Ahmad Rahami, a convicted terrorist and murderer, has filed a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The lawsuit, which was submitted in federal court in Newark, alleges that Rahami's family has faced discrimination due to their cultural background as Muslims from Afghanistan.

Rahami's family has been operating a chicken restaurant in Elizabeth since 2002. According to the lawsuit, they claim to have experienced ongoing harassment from local officials, which they argue has included numerous unjust tickets and court summons. The family contends that this treatment is rooted in their cultural identity and has been exacerbated by racial abuse from some local residents, who have reportedly made derogatory comments about Muslims.

Central to the lawsuit is the allegation that the Elizabeth police department unfairly targeted the Rahami family for staying open past 10 PM, despite having the necessary permissions to do so. The family asserts that their restaurant was subjected to undue scrutiny and pressure to close early, which they believe is a violation of their constitutional rights.

The lawsuit further claims that police officials justified their actions by stating that the area was known for criminal activity, a characterization that the Rahami family disputes. They argue that this claim was used as a pretext for the harassment they faced, which they believe was discriminatory in nature.

The timing of the lawsuit is particularly ironic, as it comes five years after Ahmad Rahami was arrested for planting bombs in the Tri-state area. His actions, which were widely condemned, have undoubtedly cast a long shadow over his family's business and their experiences in the community.

The Rahami family's allegations highlight broader issues of discrimination and racial profiling that many minority communities face. The lawsuit raises questions about the treatment of individuals based on their cultural background and the potential for systemic bias within law enforcement practices.

As the case unfolds, it will be closely watched by civil rights advocates and community members alike. The outcome could have significant implications for how police departments across the country handle allegations of discrimination and the treatment of minority-owned businesses.

In a community that has been grappling with the complexities of race, culture, and law enforcement, the Rahami family's lawsuit serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges that many face in seeking justice and equality. The legal proceedings will likely bring to light the intricate dynamics between law enforcement and the communities they serve, particularly in the context of cultural sensitivity and respect for constitutional rights.",-49.0,-48.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,477.0,-2.823529411764706,-0.10062893081761007
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

In recent discussions surrounding pay-to-play corruption, the spotlight has turned to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. Allegations have emerged suggesting that the foundation primarily served as a profit-making entity for the Clinton family and their associates, raising questions about its true purpose and financial practices.

In response to these corruption allegations, the Clinton campaign has emphasized the foundation's positive contributions to global health and development. However, critics argue that the financial data tells a different story. According to IRS filings from 2014, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants, a figure that raises eyebrows given the foundation's substantial total spending of nearly $91.3 million that year.

A closer examination of the foundation's financials reveals that less than $5.2 million was directed towards charity in 2014. In stark contrast, the foundation spent a staggering $34.8 million on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits. This significant expenditure on personnel raises concerns about the foundation's priorities and its commitment to charitable work.

Moreover, an additional $50.4 million was categorized as ""other expenses,"" which further complicates the narrative of a charity focused on altruism. Professional fundraising efforts also accounted for nearly $851,000, suggesting that a considerable portion of the foundation's resources was dedicated to generating funds rather than distributing them to those in need.

Interestingly, despite receiving an extra $30 million in 2014, the foundation's charitable spending saw a dramatic decrease of 40% compared to the previous year. This decline in charitable contributions, juxtaposed with an increase of $5 million in salaries and other expenses, has led many to question the foundation's operational integrity.

Critics assert that the financial practices of the Clinton Foundation indicate a troubling trend, where the organization may have been leveraged for personal financial gain. The author of the article concludes that the foundation has functioned as a means for the Clintons to generate significant income, particularly with Hillary Clinton's position as Secretary of State potentially providing opportunities for financial advantage.

As the debate over the Clinton Foundation's role continues, the implications of these allegations raise important questions about transparency and accountability in charitable organizations, particularly those associated with high-profile political figures. The ongoing scrutiny may have lasting effects on the foundation's reputation and the legacy of the Clintons.",25.0,14.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,446.0,0.875,0.03139013452914798

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York, former President Barack Obama has left many Americans in shock, as his remarks have drawn sharp criticism for their perceived insensitivity in the wake of recent violent incidents. The speech, which took place shortly after a weekend marked by bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing in St. Cloud, Minnesota, has been labeled by some as a display of arrogance and a failure to address pressing national concerns.

The weekend's events were harrowing, with bombings that rattled the streets of New York and New Jersey, and a stabbing incident that added to the sense of unease in St. Cloud. These acts of violence, which many are calling acts of terrorism, have left communities on edge and searching for answers. However, instead of addressing these critical issues, Obama chose to focus his speech on a high-dollar fundraiser, where he criticized sexism in the media and expressed his support for Hillary Clinton.

Critics have been quick to point out that the former President's decision to prioritize a fundraising event over addressing the violence that occurred over the weekend is both troubling and disappointing. The author of this article echoes these sentiments, expressing frustration that elected officials, including Obama, did not take the opportunity to acknowledge the victims of the attacks or the gravity of the situation. 

While some defenders of Obama argue that he may not have had sufficient information to comment on the incidents, the author believes that a brief acknowledgment of the bombings and the stabbing was not only warranted but necessary. In times of crisis, the public looks to their leaders for guidance and reassurance, and failing to address such significant events can be seen as a dereliction of duty.

The author describes Obama's response as ""disgusting,"" highlighting a growing sentiment among many Americans who feel that their leaders are out of touch with the realities facing the nation. The juxtaposition of a high-profile fundraiser with the backdrop of violence and fear has left many questioning the priorities of those in power. 

As the nation grapples with the implications of these recent attacks, the expectation is that leaders will step up and provide the necessary support and acknowledgment to those affected. Instead, Obama's focus on political issues and fundraising has raised eyebrows and sparked outrage among constituents who feel that their safety and well-being are being overlooked.

In a time when unity and solidarity are crucial, the failure to address the pain and suffering caused by these violent acts has left many feeling abandoned. The author argues that it is essential for leaders to recognize the impact of their words and actions, especially in moments of crisis. The lack of immediate response from elected officials, particularly from a figure as prominent as Obama, has only deepened the sense of disappointment and frustration among the public.

As the dust settles from the weekend's tragic events, the hope remains that leaders will take a more proactive approach in addressing the concerns of their constituents. The expectation is that they will prioritize the safety and well-being of the American people over political ambitions and fundraising efforts. In the face of adversity, the public deserves leaders who are willing to stand with them, acknowledge their struggles, and work towards solutions that foster healing and security. 

In conclusion, Obama's recent speech has not only shocked many but has also ignited a conversation about the responsibilities of elected officials in times of crisis. The call for accountability and sensitivity in leadership has never been more urgent, as the nation seeks to heal from the wounds of violence and division.",-25.0,-64.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,685.0,-2.782608695652174,-0.09343065693430656
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

A recent surge in public awareness regarding corruption at the Clinton Foundation has emerged since Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A new report has unveiled serious issues within the foundation that may have previously gone unnoticed, raising concerns about its operations and impact.

The Daily Caller has reported alarming findings related to the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a prominent program under the Clinton Foundation. According to the report, CHAI distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa, a practice that a draft congressional report suggests ""likely increased"" risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these treatments.

As one of the foundation's most significant initiatives, CHAI's actions are now under intense scrutiny, particularly as Hillary Clinton gears up for her presidential campaign. The distribution of diluted AIDS drugs could lead to heightened criticism and questions about the foundation's integrity and commitment to public health.

Further complicating matters, the congressional study has revealed connections between Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-American figures currently under investigation by the FDA and SEC. The report specifically highlights the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company notorious for its history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting practices to the FDA.

While the report raises serious concerns, uncertainty remains regarding the exact number of AIDS patients who may have received the compromised medications. The implications of these findings are significant, as they not only threaten the reputation of the Clinton Foundation but also the health and safety of vulnerable populations in need of effective treatment.

In light of these revelations, the report has called for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further harm. As the situation develops, the foundation's future and its impact on public health initiatives remain uncertain, with many calling for accountability and transparency in its operations.",-14.0,-10.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,353.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.028328611898016998
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for enacting poorly worded laws that have significant implications for parenting activities. A recent law, intended to protect children from molesters, has inadvertently criminalized normal parental interactions, raising serious concerns among legal experts and advocates for children's rights.

The law specifically targets any contact between an adult and a child's genitals, categorizing such actions as felonies. This broad definition means that routine activities such as diaper changes or baths could potentially land parents in legal trouble, transforming innocent caregivers into felons for actions that are part of everyday parenting. Critics argue that while the intention behind the law is to safeguard children, it fails to account for the innocent and necessary interactions that occur between parents and their children.

In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court has further complicated the situation by stating that defendants accused under this law must prove a lack of sexual intent. This requirement undermines the fundamental presumption of innocence, placing an undue burden on parents and caregivers who may find themselves facing serious charges for actions that are not criminal in nature. The court's decision has raised alarms about the potential for wrongful accusations and the chilling effect it may have on parental behavior.

Legal expert John Pfaff has pointed out the troubling implications of this ruling, particularly regarding plea bargaining. He notes that defendants may feel pressured to accept guilty pleas due to the threat of facing severe charges, even when they are innocent. This coercive environment could lead to a significant number of parents and caregivers being wrongfully convicted, further exacerbating the issue of prosecutorial overreach.

The court's suggestion to rely on prosecutors to exercise common sense rather than revising the problematic law has been met with skepticism. Critics argue that this approach places too much trust in the discretion of prosecutors, who may not always act in the best interest of justice. The potential for prosecutorial harassment of parents and caregivers looms large, raising questions about the protection of constitutional rights in Arizona.

Concerns about due process have been amplified, with many advocating for immediate intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court. The current legal landscape in Arizona appears to suspend essential rights for parents and caregivers, leaving them vulnerable to accusations that could have devastating consequences for their families. The lack of clarity in the law, combined with the court's ruling, has created an environment where innocent actions may be misconstrued as criminal behavior.

As the debate continues, advocates for both children's rights and parental protections are calling for a reevaluation of the law. They argue that it is crucial to strike a balance between safeguarding children and ensuring that parents can engage in necessary caregiving activities without fear of legal repercussions. The Arizona state legislature faces mounting pressure to address these concerns and amend the law to prevent further harm to families across the state. 

In the wake of this controversy, the future of parenting in Arizona hangs in the balance, as lawmakers grapple with the implications of their decisions on the lives of countless families.",-12.0,-57.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,572.0,-2.7142857142857144,-0.09965034965034965

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts with the possibility of Hillary Clinton assuming the presidency, speculation is rife regarding the future of Michelle Obama. The former First Lady, who has become a prominent figure in American culture, may find herself back in the White House, albeit under a different administration. This prospect raises questions about the implications of her presence in a potential Clinton administration and the legacy she would carry forward.

While some may welcome the idea of Michelle Obama continuing her public service, there are those who express discomfort at the thought of covering the Obamas for another four years. The Obamas have been a fixture in American politics and culture since Barack Obama’s presidency, and the prospect of their continued influence raises concerns about the saturation of their narratives in the media and public discourse.

Critics have pointed to Michelle Obama’s legacy, particularly her school lunch program, which aimed to combat childhood obesity and promote healthier eating habits among children. While the initiative garnered support from health advocates, it also faced backlash from parents and students who found the new regulations unappetizing and impractical. Additionally, some of her controversial statements during her time as First Lady have drawn scrutiny, leading to questions about her qualifications for a potential role in a Clinton administration.

Hillary Clinton has long been an advocate for government involvement in child-rearing, a belief that aligns with her vision of a more engaged government in the lives of families. This philosophy raises further questions about the role of Michelle Obama in such a framework. Would she be expected to champion policies that reflect this ideology, or would she carve out her own path? The intersection of their beliefs could lead to a powerful partnership, but it also risks alienating those who value parental autonomy and local control over education.

Despite the criticisms, Michelle Obama has remained steadfast in her commitment to her healthy living campaign for children. She has publicly stated that she has no plans to slow down her efforts, indicating a desire to continue advocating for health and wellness initiatives. This determination could position her as a key player in shaping policies that align with Clinton’s vision, but it also raises concerns about the progressive influence on education and the role of government as a parental figure.

The idea of government control over education and parenting is a contentious issue. Many parents and educators express discomfort with the notion that the government should play a significant role in raising children. This sentiment is particularly pronounced among those who believe that education should be tailored to the needs of individual families rather than dictated by overarching government policies. The potential for Michelle Obama to influence educational policy under a Clinton administration could exacerbate these concerns, leading to a broader debate about the appropriate balance between government involvement and parental rights.

As the political climate evolves, the speculation surrounding Michelle Obama’s future role remains a topic of interest. While her commitment to health and wellness initiatives is commendable, the implications of her potential involvement in a Clinton administration warrant careful consideration. The intersection of her legacy, the criticisms she faces, and the broader societal concerns about government influence in parenting and education will undoubtedly shape the narrative as the nation moves forward.

In conclusion, the prospect of Michelle Obama remaining in the White House under Hillary Clinton’s administration is fraught with complexities. As discussions about her qualifications and legacy continue, the public will be watching closely to see how these dynamics unfold in the coming years.",6.0,19.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,665.0,0.7916666666666666,0.02857142857142857

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has emerged involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), raising serious concerns about the distribution of ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This alarming revelation has sparked outrage and prompted investigations into the implications of such practices on patient health and safety.

The controversy is closely linked to Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has a troubled history in the pharmaceutical industry. In 2013, Ranbaxy was found guilty of fraud and introducing adulterated drugs into commerce, resulting in a staggering $500 million fine. This past misconduct has now resurfaced, as allegations suggest that the company may have continued its pattern of distributing substandard medications, particularly in the context of the CHAI's initiatives.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, indicating that the distribution of these substandard drugs could have significantly increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these medications for their health. The report, initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, underscores the Clinton Foundation's ongoing relationship with Ranbaxy as a central issue in this scandal. The implications of this partnership are profound, as it raises questions about the foundation's commitment to patient safety and the ethical considerations surrounding its operations.

Dinesh Thakur, a former employee of Ranbaxy, has emerged as a key whistleblower in this situation. His revelations led to a significant lawsuit against the company, shedding light on the internal practices that may have contributed to the distribution of ineffective medications. Thakur's courage in coming forward has been instrumental in bringing these issues to the forefront, prompting further scrutiny of Ranbaxy's operations and its relationship with the Clinton Foundation.

As the investigation unfolds, concerns have been raised about the number of lives potentially lost due to the distribution of these ineffective medications. The implications of providing substandard HIV/AIDS drugs are dire, particularly in regions where access to effective treatment is already limited. The potential for increased morbidity and mortality among patients is a grave concern that cannot be overlooked.

Critics have directed their ire at the Clinton Foundation for its continued partnership with Ranbaxy, especially in light of the evidence surrounding the company's poor quality control and fraudulent practices. The foundation's decision to maintain this relationship raises ethical questions about its priorities and commitment to the well-being of individuals in need of medical assistance.

In 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, a decision that has come under scrutiny in light of the recent allegations. This funding was intended to support efforts to provide essential medications to those affected by HIV/AIDS, but the potential impact of substandard medicines on patient health has raised serious concerns. The allocation of such significant resources to a company with a history of malpractice calls into question the oversight and accountability mechanisms in place to protect vulnerable populations.

The article suggests that the Clintons may be prioritizing financial gain over the well-being of individuals, particularly in the context of their charitable initiatives. This perception has the potential to undermine public trust in the Clinton Foundation and its mission to improve global health outcomes. As the scandal continues to unfold, the foundation's reputation hangs in the balance, and the implications for its future operations could be significant.

The fallout from this scandal is likely to reverberate through the political landscape, as lawmakers and advocacy groups demand accountability and transparency from both the Clinton Foundation and Ranbaxy. The potential for increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies and the public could lead to significant changes in how charitable organizations operate and partner with pharmaceutical companies.

As the investigation progresses, it remains to be seen how the Clinton Foundation will respond to these allegations and what steps will be taken to address the concerns raised by the draft congressional report. The health and safety of patients in sub-Saharan Africa hang in the balance, and the need for effective and reliable medications has never been more critical.

In conclusion, the emerging scandal surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its partnership with Ranbaxy raises serious ethical questions about the distribution of substandard HIV/AIDS drugs. The potential risks to patient health, coupled with the foundation's history of financial dealings, have sparked outrage and calls for accountability. As the investigation unfolds, the implications for the Clinton Foundation and its future operations remain uncertain, but the need for transparency and commitment to patient safety is paramount. The lives of countless individuals depend on the integrity of the organizations that seek to provide them with essential medical care.",-63.0,-23.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,840.0,-0.7666666666666667,-0.02738095238095238

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated the State Department to release documents related to security training for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides within a five-day timeframe. This decision comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit initiated by the Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which has been actively pursuing these records.

Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, rejected the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, underscoring the court's commitment to transparency in government operations. However, he did deny TheDCNF's request to depose State Department officials, a move that has drawn attention to the ongoing tensions between the media organization and the federal agency.

The core of TheDCNF's inquiry revolves around the absence of records confirming that Clinton and her aides received mandatory security briefings on the handling of classified materials. This lack of documentation raises questions about compliance with established protocols for safeguarding sensitive information, a critical issue given the high-profile nature of Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

In addition to seeking information about Clinton, TheDCNF is also pursuing records related to key members of her inner circle, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The implications of these records extend beyond mere procedural compliance; they touch upon the broader issues of accountability and transparency in government.

During the proceedings, Judge Leon expressed visible frustration with the State Department's delays in producing the requested documents. He set specific deadlines for the release of the information, requiring one-third of the documents to be made available by September 26, with the remainder due by October 10. This timeline reflects the judge's determination to expedite the process and ensure that the public has access to pertinent information regarding the handling of classified materials by high-ranking officials.

An attorney representing TheDCNF highlighted the judge's dissatisfaction with the State Department's obstruction of the FOIA process. The attorney's comments underscore the challenges faced by media organizations in obtaining information that is often critical to public understanding and oversight of government actions.

State Department officials have acknowledged that their failure to produce the requested documents suggests that the required security courses were not completed by Clinton or her aides. This admission raises serious concerns about the adherence to security protocols and the potential implications for national security during Clinton's time in office.

The ruling and the subsequent deadlines set by Judge Leon mark a pivotal moment in the ongoing scrutiny of Clinton's handling of classified information. As the State Department prepares to comply with the court's order, the release of these documents is anticipated to shed light on the security training—or lack thereof—received by Clinton and her top aides.

The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications, not only for the individuals involved but also for the broader discourse on government transparency and accountability. As the public awaits the release of the documents, the spotlight remains firmly on the State Department and its handling of this high-profile matter.

In conclusion, the federal judge's order to release security training documents related to Hillary Clinton and her aides represents a significant step in the pursuit of transparency within the government. TheDCNF's efforts to obtain this information through a FOIA lawsuit highlight the ongoing challenges faced by media organizations in holding public officials accountable. As the deadlines approach, the implications of the forthcoming documents will undoubtedly resonate beyond the courtroom, influencing public perception and discourse surrounding national security and government oversight.",-5.0,-7.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,667.0,-0.3181818181818182,-0.010494752623688156
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the nation gears up for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the role of moderator Lester Holt has come under scrutiny. Holt will guide the discussion but has made it clear that he will not engage in fact-checking the candidates during the event. This decision raises significant concerns about the integrity of the debate, particularly in light of Trump's history of making unverified claims.

Without on-screen fact-checks from major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, the responsibility of ensuring honesty falls squarely on Holt's shoulders. This places an immense burden on the moderator, as Trump has been documented to lie approximately every three-and-a-half minutes. The absence of a systematic fact-checking process could allow Trump to make assertions without accountability, relying solely on Clinton's responses to challenge his statements.

The media's reluctance to fact-check during the debate has been attributed to concerns over ratings and a desire to avoid confrontation with Trump. This approach has sparked criticism, particularly from Clinton's campaign, which emphasizes the necessity for the moderator to challenge false statements. The campaign argues that a fair debate hinges on the ability to hold candidates accountable for their claims, a sentiment echoed by many political analysts.

As the debate approaches, expectations for Clinton are notably high. She is anticipated to perform exceptionally well to counteract Trump's unchallenged assertions. This dynamic reflects a perceived double standard in the treatment of the candidates, where Clinton must exceed expectations while Trump is often allowed to make dubious claims without immediate scrutiny.

The implications of this debate structure extend beyond the candidates themselves; they raise broader concerns about the state of journalism in the context of the election. The decision to forgo fact-checking during such a pivotal event could undermine the public's ability to make informed decisions. As voters tune in, the lack of accountability for candidates' statements may lead to a distorted understanding of the issues at stake.

In a political landscape where misinformation can spread rapidly, the role of the media in providing accurate information is more crucial than ever. The upcoming debate presents a critical opportunity for Holt to navigate these challenges effectively, but the absence of a robust fact-checking mechanism may leave voters with more questions than answers. As the nation watches, the hope remains that the debate will foster a fair and informed discussion, despite the hurdles presented by the current media environment.",-6.0,6.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,458.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013100436681222707
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

In a striking revelation, Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has voiced serious concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In her recent statements, Kyle claims that Clinton is driven by ""anger and rage,"" which she believes could lead to a physical breakdown if left unaddressed.

Kyle's assertions extend beyond mere emotional observations; she contends that Clinton is experiencing cognitive impairment that raises questions about her ability to fulfill the demanding role of president. According to Kyle, symptoms such as emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty with tasks are indicative of a deeper issue that could hinder Clinton's effectiveness as a leader.

The concerns do not stop at cognitive challenges. Kyle warns that Clinton's paranoia and controlling nature could culminate in what she describes as a ""psychological disaster."" This alarming prediction underscores the potential risks associated with Clinton's temperament and decision-making capabilities, particularly in high-pressure situations that are inherent in the presidency.

In an effort to shed light on these issues, Kyle authored the book ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" which aims to reveal the truth about Clinton, including her health concerns. Through her writing, Kyle seeks to provide a candid perspective on the former Secretary of State, suggesting that Clinton's ambition may come at a significant cost to her well-being and the Democratic Party as a whole.

Kyle characterizes Clinton as ""addicted to power,"" suggesting that her relentless pursuit of political success could jeopardize not only her health but also the integrity of the party she represents. This portrayal raises critical questions about the implications of such ambition on Clinton's ability to lead effectively and responsibly.

The article notes that Hillary Clinton has faced numerous challenges in maintaining a positive public image, particularly amid ongoing health and character scandals. These issues have cast a shadow over her political career, leading to increased scrutiny from both supporters and detractors alike.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Kyle's revelations add a new layer of complexity to the ongoing discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton's candidacy. With concerns about her mental and physical fitness for the presidency now in the spotlight, the implications of these claims could resonate throughout the upcoming election cycle.",-13.0,3.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,431.0,0.2,0.0069605568445475635

YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA. NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE, NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC. WE ACCEPT MANY IMMIGRANTS, IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS, CONTRADICTING TO MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS NON-MUSLIMS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In a world increasingly characterized by migration and cultural exchange, the United States has long been celebrated as a ""nation of immigrants."" However, recent discussions have highlighted a growing sentiment that emphasizes the need for unity and cultural integration among newcomers. This perspective advocates for immigrants to adapt to American customs and traditions, rather than maintaining their own, in order to foster a cohesive national identity.

The conversation surrounding cultural integration has gained traction, particularly in light of statements made by a Quebec mayor regarding the integration of Muslims into Canadian society. The mayor asserted that it is essential for immigrants, particularly those from Muslim backgrounds, to embrace Canadian culture rather than expecting the culture to accommodate their traditions. This assertion reflects a broader belief that while diversity is welcomed, it should not come at the expense of the foundational values and identity of the host nation.

The mayor emphasized that Canadians are not inherently racist or xenophobic; rather, they are open to accepting diverse cultures. However, he firmly believes that the essence of Canadian identity and culture should remain intact and not be compromised for the sake of immigrants. This sentiment resonates with many who argue that the preservation of national identity is crucial in a multicultural society.

In a further assertion of this stance, the mayor stated that religion should remain a private matter, suggesting that municipalities have the right to refuse concessions to Islam and Sharia law. This position raises important questions about the role of religious practices in public life and the extent to which they should influence local governance. The mayor's comments reflect a desire to maintain a secular public sphere, where laws and regulations are not influenced by religious doctrines.

Moreover, the mayor's remarks included a provocative suggestion for Muslims who feel uncomfortable with Canadian culture: they have the option to return to their countries of origin. This statement underscores a growing frustration among some segments of the population regarding the perceived reluctance of certain immigrant groups to fully integrate into the cultural fabric of their new home.

The call for Americans to reject any foreign laws, including Sharia, in their judicial system echoes similar sentiments expressed in Canada. Advocates for this position argue that the legal framework of a nation should be based solely on its own laws and traditions, without the influence of external legal systems. This perspective is rooted in the belief that the majority should not be overshadowed by the minority, and that the cultural and legal integrity of the nation must be preserved.

As discussions around immigration and cultural integration continue to evolve, the emphasis on unity and shared values remains a central theme. The notion that immigrants should either adopt the local culture or consider leaving has sparked debate, with proponents arguing that a cohesive national identity is essential for social harmony. Critics, however, caution against the potential for exclusionary practices that may arise from such a rigid stance.

In conclusion, the dialogue surrounding immigration and cultural integration in North America is complex and multifaceted. While the celebration of diversity is important, the call for unity and the preservation of national identity cannot be overlooked. As both the United States and Canada navigate these challenges, the emphasis on cultural adaptation and integration will likely continue to shape the discourse on immigration policy and societal cohesion.",12.0,21.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,628.0,0.9130434782608695,0.03343949044585987

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a striking incident in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through a demonstration. Eyewitnesses initially feared for the man's safety, speculating that he might be the target of a mugging. However, in a surprising turn of events, the protesters allowed him to pass without incident.

This situation stood in stark contrast to recent reports of rioters halting vehicles and engaging in looting, raising questions about the dynamics of protest interactions. As the man approached the crowd, he calmly rolled down his window, revealing a handgun to the protesters. This action prompted a swift dispersal of the crowd, allowing him to continue on his way.

The incident has ignited a debate over the appropriateness of the man's response. Some argue that displaying a firearm escalated the situation unnecessarily, while others contend that it was a justified measure of self-defense in a potentially threatening environment. The protesters' quick retreat raises further questions about the balance of power in such confrontations and the implications of armed individuals in protest scenarios.

Critics of the man's actions suggest that he could have chosen a different approach, such as driving through the crowd without engaging. This alternative might have avoided the tension that arose from brandishing a weapon. Supporters, however, argue that in a climate where vehicles have been targeted during protests, the man's display of a firearm was a reasonable reaction to ensure his safety.

As discussions continue, the incident serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding protests and the varied responses they elicit from individuals. The balance between personal safety and the potential for escalation remains a contentious topic, particularly in the context of ongoing social movements.

In the wake of this event, community leaders and activists are calling for dialogue on how to navigate such situations in the future, emphasizing the need for understanding and communication between protesters and those who may inadvertently find themselves in the midst of demonstrations.",-18.0,-23.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,379.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.06068601583113457
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

In a striking display of perceived hypocrisy, Chicago environmentalists are under fire for their inconsistent stances on development projects that impact the city’s landscape. Critics argue that leftist groups support environmental issues until they are personally affected, revealing a troubling double standard.

Previously, these same environmentalists vehemently opposed George Lucas's proposal to build a museum in the city, citing concerns over environmental impact. However, they have now shifted their support to the Obama Presidential Library, which is set to be constructed in Jackson Park. Juanita Irizarry, the executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly expressed her excitement about the Obama center, raising eyebrows among those who remember the fierce opposition to Lucas's project.

The contradiction is stark: the Obama center's construction will necessitate the destruction of trees and grass, while Lucas's museum would have been built on an existing parking lot. This inconsistency has led to accusations that the environmentalists' decisions are influenced by factors beyond environmental concerns, with some suggesting a racial bias in their support for the Obama center over the Lucas museum.

This situation has been framed as an ""environmental dilemma,"" highlighting the complexities and contradictions within the environmental movement in Chicago. As the debate continues, critics are calling attention to what they see as liberal hypocrisy and the intricate web of Chicago politics that shapes these decisions. The apparent selective support for projects raises questions about the true motivations behind environmental advocacy in the city, leaving many to wonder whose interests are truly being served.",3.0,0.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,298.0,0.0,0.0

At one point McChrystal was called into the Oval Office and he knew his Army career was about to be over.

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

In a dramatic turn of events, General Stanley McChrystal, the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has resigned following a tense meeting with President Barack Obama. The two leaders have had a history of frequent disagreements regarding the conduct of the war, which culminated in this pivotal encounter in the Oval Office.

During the meeting, President Obama confronted McChrystal, accusing him of failing to provide the necessary political support. In a firm response, McChrystal clarified that his duty was to support Obama as Commander-in-Chief, not as a politician. This assertion led to the general submitting his resignation, signaling a significant shift in military leadership during a critical period in Afghanistan.

The relationship between McChrystal and Obama has been strained, with the President reportedly harboring negative sentiments towards the US military and its personnel. This backdrop of tension was evident in the meeting, where Obama made a parting remark that suggested McChrystal would be happy to disrespect him after his death. 

In a display of honor and integrity, McChrystal saluted and responded that he would not stand in line to disrespect anyone, underscoring his commitment to the values of the military.

Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm.

These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has recently found itself at the center of a storm of unrest, with reports indicating that a significant portion of the rioters involved in the chaos were not local residents. In fact, it has been revealed that at least 70% of those participating in the riots held out-of-state identification, raising questions about the motivations and organization behind these actions.

The police union head has characterized these individuals as ""professional criminals,"" suggesting that their presence in Charlotte was not a spontaneous reaction to local events but rather part of a planned operation aimed at inciting violence and disorder. This assertion aligns with growing concerns that outside radicals are being strategically deployed to escalate tensions during protests, undermining the peaceful intentions of many demonstrators.

In stark contrast to the turmoil in Charlotte, protests in Tulsa have remained largely peaceful. Observers note that this difference may be attributed to local sentiment and the specific circumstances surrounding the protests. In Tulsa, the police officer involved in a controversial incident has been charged with manslaughter, which may have contributed to a more subdued atmosphere among demonstrators. The local community's response appears to reflect a desire for justice and accountability, rather than chaos and violence.

The situation in Charlotte, however, paints a different picture. The city has developed a reputation for being sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement, which some suggest has made it a target for unrest. The presence of out-of-state rioters, coupled with the characterization of their actions as part of a broader revolutionary agenda, raises concerns about the potential for further escalation in the region.

The narrative surrounding the unrest in Charlotte implies that the actions of these rioters are not merely reactions to local grievances but are instead part of a calculated effort to create chaos. This perspective suggests that the goal of these actions may extend beyond immediate protests, aiming instead to promote a larger revolutionary agenda that seeks to disrupt societal norms and instigate widespread unrest.

As the situation continues to unfold, the implications of these developments are significant. The involvement of out-of-state individuals in the riots raises questions about the nature of grassroots movements and the potential for external influences to shape local protests. It also highlights the challenges faced by law enforcement and community leaders in addressing the complexities of unrest fueled by both local and external factors.

In light of these events, community leaders and activists in Charlotte are faced with the daunting task of navigating a landscape marked by division and unrest. The presence of professional criminals and outside radicals complicates the narrative of peaceful protest, making it increasingly difficult for local voices advocating for change to be heard amidst the chaos.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of these riots, the need for dialogue and understanding becomes more pressing than ever. The contrasting experiences of protests in Charlotte and Tulsa serve as a reminder of the diverse responses to issues of racial injustice and police accountability across the nation. While some communities may find themselves embroiled in violence and disorder, others are able to maintain a focus on constructive dialogue and peaceful advocacy.

In conclusion, the unrest in Charlotte underscores the complexities of modern protests and the potential for external influences to shape local dynamics. As the community seeks to heal and move forward, it will be essential to address the underlying issues that have fueled these tensions while also fostering an environment that encourages peaceful expression and meaningful change. The road ahead may be challenging, but the commitment to justice and accountability remains a vital part of the conversation.",-17.0,-36.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,669.0,-1.5,-0.053811659192825115

He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”!

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right?

In a political landscape increasingly defined by deep divisions, a new organization has emerged with a clear mission: to oppose former President Donald Trump. Common Defense PAC, which has been identified as one of the 187 groups funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, is positioning itself as a defender of the rights of all Americans while specifically targeting Trump and his policies.

Common Defense PAC claims to advocate for the interests of veterans and the broader American populace. However, the organization’s leadership team, which is said to include military veterans, has raised eyebrows due to a notable lack of publicly available contact information for these individuals. This absence of transparency has led to questions about the authenticity of the PAC’s claims to represent the veteran community.

The PAC has been active in disseminating anti-Trump content and has formed alliances with other political action committees (PACs) that are also funded by Soros. One of the most prominent campaigns associated with Common Defense PAC is the promotion of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which has garnered support from MoveOn.org, a progressive advocacy group known for its grassroots mobilization efforts.

MoveOn.org’s Political Action has taken an active role in advertising the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag, amplifying the message across various platforms. The collaboration between Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org has resulted in significant outreach, including participation in a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump. This campaign reportedly reached over 4.5 million people, showcasing the potential impact of coordinated efforts between these organizations.

The campaign has also attracted the attention of high-profile celebrities, including actor Mark Ruffalo and political commentator Van Jones, who have lent their voices to the cause. With MoveOn.org serving as the organizer, the partnership has effectively mobilized public sentiment against Trump, particularly among those who identify as veterans or supporters of veteran rights.

In addition to online campaigns, Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org organized a protest aimed at urging Senator John McCain to disavow Trump. This event highlighted the PAC’s commitment to challenging Trump’s influence within the Republican Party and advocating for a more veteran-friendly political environment.

Despite its ambitious goals, Common Defense PAC’s financial backing raises questions about its independence and representation. The PAC’s July quarterly filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) revealed that it had only one donor: Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This singular source of funding has led to skepticism regarding the PAC’s ability to genuinely represent the diverse views of veterans, particularly when its financial support appears to be concentrated in the hands of a single individual.

At the helm of Common Defense PAC is Perry O’Brien, the organization’s Director. O’Brien is a self-identified left-wing activist and conscientious objector who served in Afghanistan. His background in anti-war activism and his recent efforts to initiate a petition against Trump’s perceived attacks on veterans further underscore the PAC’s ideological leanings. However, critics have pointed out the irony of a PAC that claims to represent veterans being primarily led by a conscientious objector, raising concerns about the legitimacy of its claims to advocate for the veteran community.

As the political climate continues to evolve, the emergence of organizations like Common Defense PAC illustrates the ongoing battle for the hearts and minds of American voters. While the PAC positions itself as a champion for veterans and a vocal opponent of Trump, the questions surrounding its leadership, funding, and representation of the veteran community remain pertinent.

In a time when political affiliations and ideologies are often at odds, the effectiveness of Common Defense PAC in achieving its goals will likely depend on its ability to address these concerns and demonstrate a genuine commitment to representing the diverse voices within the veteran community. As the 2024 election cycle approaches, the scrutiny of such organizations will only intensify, making transparency and accountability more crucial than ever.",8.0,29.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,740.0,1.16,0.03918918918918919

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has brought to light a controversial decision made by the Obama administration in 2015, which allocated a staggering $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas. This revelation, which initially garnered little media attention, has resurfaced and continues to provoke significant outrage among various segments of the American public.

Critics of the funding argue that it raises serious concerns about U.S. foreign aid, particularly regarding the potential support of Islamic terrorists. Many believe that the allocation of such a substantial amount of taxpayer dollars to renovate mosques could inadvertently bolster groups that may not have the best interests of the United States at heart. This sentiment has been echoed by numerous commentators and political figures who question the wisdom of investing in foreign religious institutions while domestic issues remain unresolved.

Taxpayer advocates have expressed their frustration over what they perceive as reckless spending by the government. They argue that the U.S. is operating on a ""gigantic credit card,"" accumulating debt that future generations will have to pay off. With many Americans struggling economically, the allocation of funds for overseas mosque renovations has become a focal point of anger and discontent. Reports indicate that one-third of Americans are currently out of work, leading to heightened scrutiny of government spending priorities.

In defense of the funding, the State Department has stated that the financial support is part of broader efforts to build relationships with Islamic leaders in an attempt to combat extremism. Officials argue that fostering these relationships is crucial for national security and for promoting peace in regions where extremism has taken root. However, this justification has done little to quell the concerns of those who view the funding as misplaced, especially in light of the economic challenges facing many Americans.

The controversy surrounding the mosque renovation funding is further compounded by allegations that it is part of a larger agenda to redistribute wealth to Islamic countries. Critics suggest that this initiative is not merely about renovating places of worship but is also tied to efforts to influence U.S. demographics through the resettlement of Muslim refugees. This perspective has fueled fears among some Americans that their government is prioritizing foreign interests over domestic needs.

As the investigation continues to unfold, the implications of the funding decision remain a hot topic of debate. Many Americans are left questioning the priorities of their government and whether taxpayer money should be directed toward foreign projects when pressing issues at home remain unaddressed. The outrage surrounding the mosque renovation funding reflects a broader discontent with government spending practices and the perceived disconnect between policymakers and the everyday struggles of citizens.

In conclusion, the CBS investigation has reignited discussions about the Obama administration's decision to allocate $770 million for the renovation of mosques overseas. With critics raising concerns about potential support for terrorism, economic mismanagement, and the prioritization of foreign aid over domestic needs, the issue is likely to remain a contentious topic in American political discourse. As the nation grapples with economic challenges, the call for accountability and transparency in government spending has never been more urgent.",-13.0,-24.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,577.0,-1.1428571428571428,-0.0415944540727903

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

In a bold response to the rising tide of terrorism, the United States Marine Corps has launched a nationwide billboard campaign aimed at countering the fear and intimidation tactics employed by ISIS and similar terrorist groups. These organizations thrive on propaganda, using threats of violence to instill fear in the hearts of non-believers, whom they label as infidels. The Marines, however, are unbothered by being placed on terrorist hit lists and instead welcome the challenge posed by these extremist factions.

The billboards, strategically placed across the country, send a clear and powerful message: the Marines are prepared to confront terrorists head-on. This initiative comes at a crucial time, as the U.S. has witnessed a recent uptick in terrorist attacks, making the need for a strong and resolute response more pressing than ever. The Marine Corps aims to reassure the public that they are ready to fight back against those who seek to instill fear and chaos.

By promoting a message of readiness and resilience, the Marines are directly countering the terrorists' agenda. The billboards serve as a symbol of defiance, undermining the very goal of ISIS and its affiliates to create a climate of fear among the American populace. The Marine Corps' commitment to self-defense and national security stands in stark contrast to the tactics of intimidation employed by these extremist groups.

While the campaign has garnered support from many, it has also drawn criticism from some liberal factions. Critics have expressed anger over the billboards, suggesting that they may escalate tensions rather than promote peace. However, the article posits that these critics may prioritize appeasing terrorists over the fundamental right of Americans to defend themselves. The Marine Corps' message is clear: they will not back down in the face of threats, and they will not allow fear to dictate the actions of the American people.

In conclusion, the Marine Corps' billboard campaign is a powerful statement against the agenda of ISIS and similar terrorist organizations. By standing firm and ready to confront these threats, the Marines are sending a message that the agenda of fear and intimidation has been defeated. The resolve of the Marines serves as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the spirit of American resilience and determination will prevail.",-53.0,-33.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,429.0,-2.0625,-0.07692307692307693

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is reeling from a wave of rioting that has left the city grappling with violence and widespread looting. The unrest has severely impacted local businesses, prompting a swift response from state officials. In light of the escalating situation, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency and has deployed the National Guard to assist in restoring order.

The rioting, which has seen individuals engaging in violent acts and looting, has raised significant concerns among city officials. In an effort to deter further unrest, officials announced that individuals caught participating in these activities will face severe repercussions, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This measure aims to hold individuals accountable for their actions and discourage further violence.

The consequences extend beyond adults, as minor children involved in rioting or looting will also face serious repercussions. Officials have stated that these minors will not only lose their benefits but that their parents could also be affected. Parents of minors caught engaging in such activities may face the loss of state benefits, referrals to social services, and even the potential loss of custody of their children. This approach underscores the emphasis on parental responsibility and the need for parents to monitor their children's actions closely.

City official Wilson Stewart has been vocal about the importance of parental oversight in the wake of the riots. He urged parents to take an active role in their children's lives, emphasizing that they must be aware of their children's whereabouts and activities. ""We need parents to step up and take responsibility for their children’s actions,"" Stewart stated, highlighting the community's role in preventing further unrest.

In addition to the strict measures against rioters, a mandatory curfew has been implemented in Charlotte. This curfew is designed to help restore order and ensure the safety of residents as the city works to recover from the chaos. The curfew aims to limit the movement of individuals during the night, reducing the likelihood of further violence and looting.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of the riots, the community is left to reflect on the events that have unfolded. The combination of a state of emergency, the deployment of the National Guard, and the implementation of strict consequences for those involved in the unrest signals a determined effort by state and local officials to regain control of the situation.

The impact of the riots on local businesses has been profound, with many establishments suffering significant losses due to looting and vandalism. The community is now faced with the challenge of rebuilding and healing in the wake of the violence. As officials work to restore order, the emphasis on accountability and parental responsibility serves as a reminder of the collective effort needed to prevent such incidents in the future.

In the coming days, the city will continue to navigate the complexities of the situation, with the hope that the measures taken will lead to a safer and more stable environment for all residents of Charlotte.",-33.0,-24.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,570.0,-1.0909090909090908,-0.042105263157894736

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey is under increasing scrutiny and may be facing resignation as criticism mounts over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. The controversy has intensified following revelations that Comey granted immunity to several of Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills. Reports indicate that Mills allegedly did not fully cooperate with the investigation, raising questions about the integrity of the inquiry.

The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28, where Comey will be called to account for his actions during the investigation. This hearing comes at a time when public and political pressure is mounting, with calls for Comey to step down from his position. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has been particularly vocal, demanding Comey's resignation and questioning his fitness for office. DiGenova has characterized the investigation as inadequate, suggesting that it was structured to appear legitimate while ultimately shielding individuals from prosecution.

As Congress continues to hold hearings to investigate the handling of the email scandal, Comey is expected to face tough questions regarding his decisions and the overall conduct of the investigation. The scrutiny is not limited to the investigation's outcomes; it also extends to Comey's actions and the implications they may have for his career and legal standing. The FBI Director has been issued a subpoena by Congress to provide documents related to the investigation, which he has previously failed to deliver, further complicating his position.

The situation has led to growing concerns about Comey's loyalty to Clinton and whether his actions were influenced by political considerations. Critics argue that the decisions made during the investigation could undermine the credibility of the FBI and its leadership. As the hearings approach, the pressure on Comey is likely to escalate, with many watching closely to see how he will respond to the allegations and the demands for accountability.

The fallout from the email scandal continues to reverberate through the political landscape, and Comey's role in the investigation remains a focal point of contention. With the House Judiciary Committee poised to delve deeper into the matter, the coming weeks could prove pivotal for Comey and the future of the FBI's leadership. As the investigation unfolds, the implications for Comey's career and the broader implications for the FBI's reputation are yet to be fully realized. 

In a climate of heightened scrutiny and political division, the outcome of the upcoming hearing may not only determine Comey's fate but also set a precedent for how similar investigations are conducted in the future. The stakes are high, and the eyes of the nation are on the unfolding drama surrounding one of the most controversial investigations in recent history.",-17.0,-24.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,509.0,-1.3333333333333333,-0.047151277013752456

In a shocking revelation, Saudi Arabia, a significant donor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, has been implicated in the horrific practice of selling ISIS sex slaves at public auctions. This alarming connection raises serious ethical questions about the influence of foreign donations on American politics and the implications of U.S. support for a nation with such a troubling human rights record.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has long been scrutinized for its role in global terrorism, particularly given that the majority of the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks were Saudi nationals. This historical context casts a shadow over the United States' continued support for the Kingdom, especially in light of recent reports detailing the trafficking of women, including Yazidis and Christians, who are being sold in auctions to various buyers, including individuals from Western nations.

The Saudi deputy crown prince has publicly stated that the Kingdom funded 20% of Clinton's campaign, a fact that has drawn criticism from various quarters. Critics argue that accepting money from nations perceived as adversaries, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, undermines the integrity of American political processes and raises ethical concerns about the motivations behind such financial support.

The Islamic State has a notorious history of abusing and trafficking sex slaves, with a particular focus on non-Muslim women. Reports indicate that these women are subjected to unimaginable horrors, being sold to the highest bidder in a grotesque display of human commodification. The complicity of nations like Saudi Arabia in these practices not only highlights the urgent need for accountability but also calls into question the moral compass of those who accept their financial backing.

In light of these revelations, there is a growing call for an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Critics argue that the U.S. government is complicit in these human rights abuses by maintaining relationships with a country that engages in such egregious violations. The continued flow of arms to Saudi Arabia, a nation implicated in the trafficking of women and the funding of terrorism, raises serious ethical dilemmas for American policymakers.

The author of this article expresses deep concern over the potential consequences of electing leaders who appear indifferent to the plight of women and children affected by trafficking and violence. The normalization of relationships with countries that engage in such practices sends a troubling message about the values that underpin American democracy and the importance of human rights.

As the U.S. navigates its foreign policy, it is imperative that leaders prioritize the protection of vulnerable populations and take a stand against human rights abuses. The implications of accepting foreign donations from nations with questionable human rights records cannot be overstated, as it risks compromising the integrity of the political process and the moral standing of the United States on the global stage.

In conclusion, the troubling ties between Saudi Arabia, the trafficking of women, and U.S. political campaigns demand urgent attention. The revelations surrounding the sale of ISIS sex slaves and the Kingdom's financial influence on American politics highlight the need for a reevaluation of relationships with nations that engage in human rights violations. It is crucial for American leaders to distance themselves from such countries and to advocate for the rights and dignity of all individuals, particularly those who are most vulnerable. The future of American democracy and its commitment to human rights depend on the choices made by its leaders today.",-30.0,-30.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,643.0,-1.4285714285714286,-0.04665629860031104
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle was characterized by intense exchanges between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump. The event, which took place on September 26, 2016, was moderated by NBC's Lester Holt, who faced scrutiny for his handling of the debate, particularly in his interactions with Trump.

Critics quickly pointed out that Holt interrupted Trump multiple times to ""fact-check"" his statements, with many of these fact-checks later deemed inaccurate. This approach raised questions about the moderator's impartiality and the overall fairness of the debate format. One of the most contentious moments occurred when Holt pressed Trump on his alleged support for the Iraq War, a claim that Trump vehemently denied. In contrast, Holt did not pose similar questions to Clinton regarding her own vote in favor of the war, which many observers felt highlighted a bias in the moderation.

Following the debate, an interview with Fox News' Neil Cavuto revealed that Trump had expressed reservations about the invasion of Iraq. In the interview, Trump articulated his uncertainty regarding the decision to invade, suggesting that more deliberation was necessary and that the United Nations should have been more involved in the process. This revelation added another layer to the debate, as it contradicted Holt's insistence that Trump had supported the war.

The aftermath of the debate sparked a broader discussion about the role of the mainstream media in shaping public perception of candidates. Critics argued that the media's focus on discrediting Trump overshadowed the need for a substantive debate on the issues at hand. This sentiment resonated with many of Trump's supporters, who felt that the media was more interested in undermining the Republican nominee than facilitating a fair discussion of policies and ideas.

Throughout the debate, Trump was noted for his ability to stand his ground against both Clinton and the media. His assertive demeanor and refusal to back down from contentious topics resonated with his base, who appreciated his combative style. As the election season progressed, the dynamics established during this debate would continue to influence the discourse surrounding both candidates.

In summary, the first presidential debate set the stage for a contentious election cycle, with heated exchanges and a focus on media interactions that raised questions about fairness and bias. As both candidates prepared for the challenges ahead, the debate underscored the importance of clear communication and the need for voters to critically evaluate the information presented to them.",-9.0,0.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,467.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The Birther movement, which gained traction during Barack Obama's presidency, has sparked intense debate regarding its implications and whether it reflects an underlying bias against the former president. Central to this discussion are claims about Obama's birthplace, which have been fueled by various sources, including a 2004 article from Breitbart that controversially stated, ""Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate."" This assertion came at a time when Obama was poised to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his rival, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a scandal.

The controversy surrounding Obama's birthplace has persisted, with critics pointing to a 1991 promotional booklet from Obama's literary agency. This booklet described him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii,” a characterization that has been scrutinized in light of the ongoing debate about his American citizenship. The booklet was distributed to colleagues in the publishing industry and included a biography of Obama alongside other authors, raising questions about the accuracy of the information presented.

Despite the claims made in the Breitbart article and the details in the 1991 booklet, Obama never publicly refuted the assertions regarding his birthplace. This silence has led to speculation and further fueled the Birther movement, which questions the validity of his American birth and citizenship. The implications of these claims are significant, as they challenge the narrative that Obama has presented throughout his political career.

The article raises critical questions: If Obama’s birthplace is indeed valid, then the claims made in the literary agency's booklet must be false. Conversely, if the booklet's description is accurate, it casts doubt on Obama's American citizenship. This dichotomy presents a contradiction in Obama's narrative regarding his birthplace, leaving many to wonder about the truth behind the conflicting accounts.

As the Birther movement continues to influence public perception, it is essential to consider the broader implications of these claims. The movement has not only questioned Obama's legitimacy as a president but has also highlighted the biases that may exist against him as a Black leader in a predominantly white political landscape. The persistence of these questions about his birthplace raises concerns about the motivations behind the Birther movement and whether it is rooted in genuine inquiry or a deeper-seated bias.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate surrounding Obama's birthplace and the Birther movement underscores the complexities of identity, race, and politics in America. As the narrative unfolds, it remains crucial to examine the implications of these claims and their impact on public perception and political discourse.",-18.0,-17.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,486.0,-1.0,-0.03497942386831276

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

However, her performance was not without controversy, as social media users quickly turned their attention to a peculiar flesh-colored device visible in her ear, igniting a flurry of speculation regarding its purpose.

The device, which many observers speculated could be an earpiece, led to a variety of theories circulating online.
