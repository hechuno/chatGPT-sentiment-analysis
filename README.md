# Sentiment Analysis of Content Created by chatGPT

Under the supervision of Professor Raphaël Khoury, this is my final project to obtain my bachelor's in computer science from the University of Québec in Outaouais.

## Objective

ChatGPT is writing more content. Ideally, chatGPT would use language that is unbiased and factual. This research seeks to find if the content created by chatGPT is positive, neutral, or negative. In particular, it seeks to find if chatGPT is biased towards certain subjects and if/how much the temperature parameter affects the language used by chatGPT. We used the chatGPT 4o-mini model and the chatGPT API to generate the data.

**Please reference the report for details. It is in French.**
