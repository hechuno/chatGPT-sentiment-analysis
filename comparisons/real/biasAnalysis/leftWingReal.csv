The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the partyâ€™s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. â€œWeâ€™re going to be here next week. Weâ€™re probably going to have some downtime,â€ù Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. â€œThereâ€™s no reason we couldnâ€™t vote.â€ù

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundationâ€™s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romneyâ€™s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democratâ€™s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is â€œethically compromisedâ€ù and the â€œking of the welfare kings.â€ù

Ironically, Romneyâ€™s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know whatâ€™s inside Republican nominee Donald Trumpâ€™s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidentâ€™s crimes.

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trumpâ€™s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywoodâ€™s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

â€œThis yearâ€™s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people weâ€™re one of their closest friends.â€ù

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

â€œIf it werenâ€™t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.â€ù

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

â€œThatâ€™s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us â€˜Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we donâ€™t have to watch reality shows anymore, because weâ€™re living in one. Thank you, Mark.â€ù

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. Thatâ€™s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trumpâ€™s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. [â€?] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomasâ€™ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomasâ€™ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the manâ€™s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from â€œspeaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.â€ù

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said â€œEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.â€ù To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: â€œSays who?â€ù

In a stunning interview with CNNâ€™s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

â€œI think personally if you start getting into fact checking, Iâ€™m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.â€ù

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesnâ€™t want moderators correcting lies because â€œwhat is a big fact, what is a little fact?â€ù #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW â€” John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Mondayâ€™s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. Thatâ€™s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trumpâ€™s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trumpâ€™s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was â€œsleepingâ€ù when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clintonâ€™s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what itâ€™s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trumpâ€™s lying â€œso greatly exceed[s] Clintonâ€™s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.â€ù Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (â€œunemployment rateâ€ù), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBIâ€™s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesnâ€™t need to serve as the â€œEncyclopedia Britannica,â€ù he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? â€” Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 â€” Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? â€” Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trumpâ€™s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy ideaâ€?..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. â€” Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party thatâ€™s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying â€œyesâ€ù to Fox News almost every day but saying â€œnoâ€ù to most other major networks and news organizations â€” a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into â€œFox & Friendsâ€ù on Monday morning, he is booked on â€œThe Oâ€™Reilly Factorâ€ù Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidateâ€™s exposure to hard-hitting questions â€” while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts wonâ€™t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isnâ€™t challenged â€“ and thatâ€™s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isnâ€™t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in â€œswingâ€ù districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney â€œlandslideâ€ù the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Hereâ€™s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Mondayâ€™s debate? â€” Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outletâ€™s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

Thereâ€™s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last nightâ€™s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins arenâ€™t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesnâ€™t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, â€œMajority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNNâ€™s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.â€ù They actually looks like theyâ€™re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Mondayâ€™s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think itâ€™s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

â€œThis is a guy who said â€” and wants to be president â€” that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?â€ù

Adding:

â€œEvery president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what weâ€™re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.â€ù

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

â€œHe does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they donâ€™t take pleasure from â€˜Youâ€™re fired.â€™ They donâ€™t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.â€ù

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and donâ€™t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

â€œHe acknowledged that he didnâ€™t pay taxes because, he said, heâ€™s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here whoâ€™s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.â€ù

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

â€œIf this choice isnâ€™t clear, I donâ€™t know â€“- my lordâ€? What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.â€ù

And itâ€™s true, the choice is abundantly clear â€” Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, itâ€™s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe weâ€™ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Todayâ€™s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, itâ€™s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but letâ€™s not forget that itâ€™s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, weâ€™ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Doucheâ€™s Twitter account this morning, I couldnâ€™t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when youâ€™re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When â€œliberalsâ€ù â€” otherwise known as â€œsane peopleâ€ù â€” try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, weâ€™re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. Itâ€™s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those â€œliberalsâ€ù every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. Iâ€™ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and Iâ€™ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, weâ€™d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didnâ€™t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

â€œWho the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?â€ù

Adding:

â€œThis is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.â€ù

Chelsea then said:

â€œStop telling women to smile. We donâ€™t like that. Itâ€™s not an icebreaker, itâ€™s a deal breaker.â€ù

Going for Priebusâ€™ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

â€œYou know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.â€ù

And thatâ€™s exactly right.
