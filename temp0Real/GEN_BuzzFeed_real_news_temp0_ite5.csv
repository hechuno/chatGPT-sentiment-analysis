Real_1-Webpage,Another Terrorist Attack in NYC…Why Are we STILL Being Politically Correct – Eagle Rising,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

On September 17, 2023, a significant explosion rocked Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, injuring 29 individuals and causing extensive property damage. The blast occurred on West 23rd Street, where a homemade bomb had been placed in a dumpster. Fortunately, no fatalities were reported, but the incident has raised serious concerns about urban security and the ongoing threat of terrorism in the United States.

The explosion in Chelsea was not an isolated incident. Just days prior, a similar bomb detonated in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, during a charity race, also resulting in no casualties. This pattern of violence has led law enforcement to conclude that the explosives used in both New York and New Jersey were linked to the same individual, suggesting a coordinated effort to instill fear in public spaces.

In the aftermath of the Chelsea explosion, all injured individuals were treated and released from the hospital by Sunday morning, a relief for families and friends who feared the worst. However, the incident has sparked a broader conversation about the nature of terrorism and the challenges society faces in addressing it. 

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the media following the explosion, stating that there was no specific threat from any terror organization. However, he acknowledged that the explosion was an intentional act, underscoring the need for vigilance in urban areas. His comments reflect a growing concern among city officials about the potential for similar attacks in densely populated areas, where soft targets are prevalent.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo took a firmer stance, labeling the explosion as an act of terrorism. He emphasized the importance of clarity in defining terrorism, a term that has become increasingly politicized in recent years. Cuomo's remarks highlight the complexities of addressing terrorism in a society that often grapples with political correctness and the fear of stigmatizing certain groups.

The incident has also drawn reactions from prominent political figures, including presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Clinton called for increased support for first responders, recognizing the critical role they play in managing crises and ensuring public safety. In contrast, Trump advocated for a tougher approach to security, suggesting that the nation must adopt more stringent measures to protect its citizens from potential threats.

The Chelsea explosion has reignited discussions about the vulnerability of soft targets in the U.S. These locations, which include public spaces such as parks, shopping districts, and community events, are often seen as easy targets for those looking to instill fear and chaos. The lack of security measures in these areas raises questions about how prepared the nation is to handle such threats.

As the investigation into the Chelsea explosion continues, law enforcement agencies are working diligently to identify the individual responsible for both the New York and New Jersey incidents. The connection between the two events has prompted a collaborative effort among various agencies, highlighting the importance of information sharing and coordination in combating terrorism.

The societal perception of terrorism is also a critical aspect of this ongoing dialogue. Many individuals struggle to reconcile the idea of terrorism with the realities of everyday life, particularly in urban environments where the potential for violence can feel omnipresent. The challenge lies in addressing these fears while also promoting a sense of community and resilience.

In light of these events, there is a growing call for strong leadership to protect citizens from terrorism. Leaders at all levels must prioritize public safety and work to create an environment where individuals feel secure in their daily lives. This includes not only enhancing security measures but also fostering a culture of awareness and preparedness among the public.

The Chelsea explosion serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present threat of terrorism in modern society. As communities grapple with the implications of such violence, it is essential to engage in open discussions about the nature of terrorism, the vulnerabilities of soft targets, and the need for effective leadership in addressing these challenges.

In conclusion, the events of September 17, 2023, have left an indelible mark on the Chelsea neighborhood and the broader New York City community. As the investigation unfolds and the nation reflects on the implications of these attacks, it is crucial to remain vigilant and proactive in the face of potential threats. The dialogue surrounding terrorism, public safety, and community resilience must continue, ensuring that citizens are not only informed but also empowered to contribute to a safer society.",-43.0,-9.0,930.0,-1.2285714285714286,-0.046236559139784944,828.0,-0.2727272727272727,-0.010869565217391304
Real_10-Webpage,"Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests","Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.

""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.

The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.

""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""

He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.

""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""

But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.

Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.

During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""

Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.

Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.

""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.

In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",http://abcn.ws/2d4lNn9,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg,"More Candace,Adam Kelsey,Abc News,More Adam",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437,"{""fb_title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@adam_kels"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-22"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-22"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-22 14:33:00"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh""}","- Protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, turned violent following the police killing of African-American man Keith Lamont Scott.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has become the epicenter of unrest following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man. The protests, which began peacefully, escalated into violence, reflecting deep-seated tensions surrounding police conduct and community relations. The incident has reignited discussions about systemic issues affecting African-American communities across the nation.

In the wake of the protests, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, addressed the unrest during a speech at the Shale Insight 2016 Conference. He attributed some of the violence to the impact of drugs, suggesting that substance abuse plays a significant role in the turmoil. Trump's remarks came as he condemned the violence that erupted in Charlotte, calling for national unity and better control of cities to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

During his speech, Trump praised law enforcement, emphasizing the importance of proper training and accountability for police misconduct. He underscored the need for law enforcement agencies to be held responsible for their actions, a sentiment that resonates with many who have been advocating for police reform. However, Trump's comments did not address the broader context of the protests, particularly the pattern of violence against African-Americans by police, which has been a primary catalyst for the demonstrations.

In a bid to connect with African-American voters, Trump has recently posed a provocative question: what do they have to lose by voting for him? This appeal comes amid a backdrop of his portrayal of a bleak view of black poverty and crime, which he argues necessitates a change in leadership. Trump has claimed that many inner cities are in dire conditions, despite evidence indicating significant educational and economic progress among black Americans in recent years.

Trump's outreach to the African-American community included a visit to a black church in Cleveland, where he discussed various issues affecting the community. During this visit, he touched upon the controversial policing strategy known as ""stop and frisk."" Initially, Trump expressed support for the practice, which has been criticized for disproportionately targeting minority communities. However, he later clarified that his endorsement was intended specifically for Chicago, attempting to narrow the focus of his comments.

In his remarks, Trump made a distinction between what he referred to as ""violent disruptors"" and the broader black community. He acknowledged the need to improve life for African-American families, suggesting that his administration would prioritize policies aimed at uplifting these communities. This differentiation is crucial, as it attempts to separate the actions of a few individuals from the larger population, a move that may resonate with some voters who feel misrepresented by the media narratives surrounding protests.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to unfold, the protests serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by African-American communities in the United States. The unrest highlights the urgent need for dialogue and reform in policing practices, as well as a broader understanding of the systemic issues that contribute to these tensions. 

The events in Charlotte are not isolated; they are part of a larger national conversation about race, justice, and the role of law enforcement in society. As the presidential election approaches, candidates like Trump are faced with the challenge of addressing these complex issues in a way that resonates with voters across the spectrum. 

In the coming weeks, the focus will likely remain on the protests in Charlotte and the broader implications for race relations in America. The response from political leaders, including Trump, will be closely scrutinized as the nation grapples with the realities of systemic racism and the urgent need for change. 

As the protests continue, the voices of those advocating for justice and accountability will remain at the forefront, demanding that the issues surrounding police violence and community relations be addressed with the seriousness they deserve. The events in Charlotte may serve as a catalyst for change, prompting a reevaluation of policies and practices that have long been criticized for their impact on African-American communities. 

In this critical moment, the call for unity and understanding is more important than ever, as the nation seeks to navigate the complexities of race, justice, and the future of policing in America. The outcome of these discussions will shape the landscape of American society for years to come, making it imperative for all voices to be heard in the pursuit of a more just and equitable future.",-51.0,-33.0,768.0,-1.7,-0.06640625,821.0,-1.1379310344827587,-0.040194884287454324

Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.

Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”

So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.

Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.

How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right?

In a recent address to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama articulated a nuanced perspective on the delicate balance between liberty and security. His remarks have ignited a heated debate regarding the implications of his stance on American sovereignty and national safety.

During his speech, Obama proposed that the United States should be willing to accept certain constraints on freedom in the interest of fostering international cooperation and enhancing global security. He argued that by relinquishing some degree of freedom of action, the U.S. could bolster its long-term security without jeopardizing its ability to safeguard core national interests. This assertion raises critical questions about the extent to which a nation should compromise its foundational principles in pursuit of a perceived greater good.

A significant portion of Obama's address focused on the acceptance of Muslim refugees, which he linked directly to national security. He posited that aiding those in need not only fulfills a moral obligation but also contributes to a more stable and secure global environment. By extending a helping hand to refugees fleeing conflict and persecution, Obama suggested that the U.S. could play a pivotal role in promoting international stability.

However, this perspective has drawn sharp criticism from various quarters. Detractors argue that Obama's approach undermines American sovereignty and poses risks to national safety. They contend that the acceptance of refugees, particularly from regions plagued by extremism, could inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities. The author of a recent critique pointed to Germany's experience with refugee integration, highlighting concerns over social cohesion and the potential for radicalization among certain groups.

Moreover, the article referenced recent terrorist attacks in the United States, suggesting that these incidents underscore the need for a more cautious approach to immigration and refugee policies. Critics assert that the potential dangers associated with accepting refugees outweigh the benefits of humanitarian assistance, arguing that national security should take precedence over international obligations.

The author further characterized Obama's stance as part of a broader liberal agenda that threatens constitutional rights and the safety of American citizens. They argue that prioritizing international cooperation at the expense of domestic security could lead to a slippery slope, where the rights of citizens are compromised in the name of globalism. This perspective resonates with a segment of the population that values a more isolationist approach to foreign policy, emphasizing the need to protect American interests first and foremost.

As the debate continues, it is clear that Obama's address has struck a chord with both supporters and opponents of his views. Proponents of his approach argue that a commitment to international cooperation and humanitarian assistance is essential for fostering a more peaceful world. They contend that the U.S. has a moral responsibility to assist those in need, particularly in the face of global crises.

Conversely, critics maintain that the risks associated with accepting refugees and compromising national security are too great to ignore. They call for a reevaluation of immigration policies that prioritize the safety and sovereignty of the United States over international obligations.

In conclusion, Obama's address to the United Nations General Assembly has reignited a critical conversation about the balance between liberty and security. As the nation grapples with the implications of his proposals, the discourse surrounding immigration, national security, and American values will undoubtedly continue to evolve. The challenge remains to find a path that honors both the principles of freedom and the imperative of safety in an increasingly complex global landscape.",23.0,25.0,576.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03993055555555555,639.0,1.0,0.03912363067292645
Real_12-Webpage,Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works,"Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump’s vision.

As he made clear once again in Monday night’s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.”

Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ‘I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “Incomes went up for everybody.”

Story Continued Below

That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “My whole life is about winning. … I always win,” Trump says in explaining why he’s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “Winning the Global Competition.” You don’t get more zero-sum than that.

Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–Trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.

The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.

Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.

No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan’s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.

Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.

Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.

The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders’ powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.

Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. They aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.

We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.

As the 2016 election cycle unfolded, the American electorate found itself grappling with starkly contrasting economic philosophies, epitomized by the two leading candidates: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. At the heart of this divide lies a fundamental disagreement about the nature of the economy itself. Trump’s perspective is rooted in a zero-sum view, where one person's gain is perceived as another's loss, while Clinton advocates for a more inclusive economic approach that suggests prosperity can be shared among all.

Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which he argues has been detrimental to American manufacturing. He emphasizes the need to protect American jobs from foreign competition, framing his economic narrative around the idea that the success of American workers is contingent upon limiting the advantages afforded to foreign entities. This perspective resonates with many Americans who feel that their livelihoods have been threatened by globalization and outsourcing.

In stark contrast, Hillary Clinton promotes a vision of shared prosperity, drawing on the economic successes of the 1990s during her husband’s presidency. She argues that an economy can be structured in a way that benefits everyone, not just a select few. This belief in inclusivity and opportunity for all stands in direct opposition to Trump’s zero-sum mentality, which suggests that economic growth for one group inherently comes at the expense of another.

The 2016 election has thus become a battleground for these competing ideologies. On one side, Trump’s supporters often express feelings of being left behind by the rapid changes in the economy, a sentiment that has fueled his rise. Many Americans, particularly those in rural areas or industries affected by globalization, have found solace in Trump’s rhetoric, which validates their frustrations and fears. Despite recent Census data indicating a rise in median income, this statistic fails to capture the diverse experiences of all Americans, particularly those who continue to struggle in the face of economic shifts.

Clinton’s support, on the other hand, is notably stronger among urban populations and those who perceive themselves as thriving in the current economic landscape. Her message of inclusivity appeals to individuals who believe that the economy can be a rising tide that lifts all boats, rather than a battleground where only a few can succeed. This polarization in support reflects a broader societal divide between those who subscribe to a zero-sum worldview and those who advocate for expanding opportunities for all.

Economists generally argue against the zero-sum perspective, asserting that the economy is not a fixed pie but rather a dynamic system that can be structured to benefit everyone. They contend that innovation, education, and investment in human capital can lead to growth that is not only sustainable but also equitable. This view aligns more closely with Clinton’s vision, which emphasizes the importance of creating pathways for success that do not rely on the detriment of others.

Historical parallels can be drawn to the Progressive Movement, which emerged in response to similar sentiments about inequality and the need for reform. Just as the Progressives sought to address the disparities of their time, the current political landscape reflects a renewed urgency to confront economic inequality. The divide between zero-sum thinkers and those who believe in shared prosperity echoes the struggles of the past, highlighting the ongoing relevance of these debates in shaping American society.

Interestingly, Trump has garnered some support from business leaders who resonate with his worldview, despite their own economic successes. This alignment suggests that even those who have thrived in the current economy may find appeal in a narrative that prioritizes protectionism and a more combative stance against foreign competition. However, this approach raises concerns about the long-term implications for economic growth and stability.

Critics warn that a zero-sum approach may lead to further division and insecurity within the nation. By framing economic success as a competition where one group must lose for another to win, the potential for collaboration and collective progress diminishes. In contrast, an open economy that prioritizes education, innovation, and inclusivity can foster an environment where all individuals have the opportunity to succeed.

As the election approaches, the stakes are high. The choice between a zero-sum mentality and a vision of shared prosperity will not only shape the future of economic policy but also influence the broader social fabric of the nation. The outcome of this ideological battle will determine whether America moves toward a more divided society or embraces a path that seeks to uplift all its citizens.

In conclusion, the 2016 election serves as a critical juncture in the ongoing debate about the nature of the economy and the values that underpin it. The contrasting views of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton encapsulate a broader struggle between competing visions of economic success. As voters head to the polls, they must consider not only their own economic circumstances but also the implications of their choices for the future of the nation. The path forward will require a careful balancing act, one that recognizes the complexities of the economy and the diverse experiences of all Americans.",72.0,64.0,1571.0,1.3333333333333333,0.04583068109484405,957.0,1.8285714285714285,0.06687565308254964
Real_13-Webpage,"President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill, Setting Up Showdown With Congress","President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

“I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message.

“I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”

The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.

Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.

The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.

If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.

Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.

""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.

""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.""

But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks.

In a significant move today, President Obama vetoed the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" (JASTA), a bill that would have allowed survivors of the September 11 attacks and the families of victims to sue the Saudi government. The veto comes just days after Congress overwhelmingly approved the legislation, which passed with near-unanimous support in both the House and Senate.

In his statement regarding the veto, Obama expressed deep sympathy for the families affected by the 9/11 tragedy and reiterated his administration's commitment to justice. However, he raised concerns about the potential implications of the bill, particularly regarding the principle of ""sovereign immunity."" The White House argues that allowing lawsuits against foreign governments for terrorism-related damages could expose the United States to similar legal actions from other countries, potentially jeopardizing national interests and diplomatic relations.

The veto marks a pivotal moment in Obama's presidency, as it would be his first veto override if Congress successfully votes to overturn it. This scenario is particularly noteworthy given Obama's high approval ratings, which could complicate the political landscape surrounding the issue. The last president to serve without a veto override was Lyndon B. Johnson, highlighting the rarity of such a situation in modern governance.

The JASTA legislation has garnered significant attention, especially from the families of 9/11 victims who have long sought accountability for the attacks. The political pressure on the Obama administration has intensified as these families advocate for justice, pushing for the ability to hold foreign entities accountable for their alleged roles in terrorism.

Saudi Arabia, which has been the target of accusations regarding its involvement in the 9/11 attacks, has actively lobbied against the bill. The Saudi government has consistently denied any connection to the attacks, and officials have expressed concerns that the legislation could strain U.S.-Saudi relations, which have historically been complex and multifaceted.

As the political landscape evolves, the possibility of a veto override looms large. To successfully overturn the veto, Congress would need a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate. Given the bill's previous unanimous passage, there is a strong likelihood that lawmakers may rally to support the legislation once more.

In the wake of the veto, the White House is reportedly working to galvanize Democratic support to block any override efforts. This maneuvering underscores the delicate balance of power and the intricate dynamics at play in Congress, particularly as the nation approaches a pivotal election season.

Adding to the political discourse, Hillary Clinton, who served as Secretary of State under Obama, has publicly stated that she would sign the legislation if elected president. This endorsement from a prominent political figure could further energize supporters of the bill and complicate the administration's efforts to maintain party unity on the issue.

As the debate continues, the implications of the JASTA bill extend beyond the immediate concerns of justice for 9/11 families. The potential for legal repercussions against foreign governments raises questions about the future of international relations and the principles of sovereignty that underpin diplomatic interactions. The coming weeks will be critical as Congress deliberates the next steps in this contentious issue, with the voices of victims' families echoing in the halls of power.",-7.0,7.0,550.0,-0.4375,-0.012727272727272728,602.0,0.3181818181818182,0.011627906976744186

There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.

The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.

It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474473199000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUv7x5bXV4,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/riot.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice.

Protests erupted in North Carolina in response to the shooting of a Black man on a highway, drawing significant attention and concern from local communities and law enforcement. The demonstrations, which were initially organized by Black Lives Matter activists, quickly escalated into violent confrontations, raising questions about the impact of such actions on the broader civil rights movement.

As tensions mounted, rioters took to the streets, throwing rocks at vehicles and blocking a major interstate, disrupting traffic and endangering the safety of motorists. The situation intensified when a female truck driver was ambushed during the chaos. While she was inside her truck, rioters looted her vehicle and set her cargo on fire. The driver, understandably shaken, called the police for assistance, but reports indicate that no help arrived in time to prevent the destruction of her property or ensure her safety. Media outlets captured footage of the incident, highlighting the alarming turn of events and the growing unrest.

By the end of the night, the violence had taken a toll on law enforcement, with 16 police officers reported injured amid the chaos. The freeway, a vital artery for transportation, was shut down as authorities struggled to regain control of the situation. The events of the night have sparked a heated debate about the methods employed by protesters and the potential ramifications for the Black Lives Matter movement.

Critics of the protests argue that the violent actions of a few individuals not only undermine the message of the Black Lives Matter movement but also exacerbate existing racial tensions within the community. The philosophy of civil rights activism, as championed by figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., emphasized love, integrity, and peaceful protest as the cornerstones of social change. In stark contrast, the recent events in North Carolina reflect a departure from these principles, raising concerns about the long-term effects on the fight for racial equality.

The juxtaposition of current protests with the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. serves as a poignant reminder of the power of peaceful activism. King’s approach sought to unite individuals across racial lines through understanding and compassion, fostering dialogue rather than division. The violent actions witnessed in North Carolina stand in stark contrast to this philosophy, potentially alienating supporters and detracting from the critical issues at hand.

As the community grapples with the aftermath of the protests, it is essential to reflect on the methods employed in the pursuit of justice. While the shooting of a Black man on a highway is undoubtedly a serious issue that warrants attention and action, the means by which activists choose to express their outrage can significantly influence public perception and support for their cause. The challenge lies in finding a balance between passionate advocacy and the preservation of peace and safety for all community members.

In the wake of these events, it is crucial for leaders within the Black Lives Matter movement to reassess their strategies and consider the implications of violent protests on their mission. The goal of achieving racial equality and justice is one that resonates deeply within society, but it must be pursued through methods that honor the legacy of those who fought for civil rights with dignity and respect.

As North Carolina continues to process the fallout from the protests, the hope remains that future demonstrations will reflect the values of love and integrity that have historically driven the civil rights movement forward. Only then can true progress be made in the ongoing struggle for justice and equality.",-44.0,-8.0,572.0,-1.6296296296296295,-0.07692307692307693,655.0,-0.34782608695652173,-0.012213740458015267
Real_15-Webpage,10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.

The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.

Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:

1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.

When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.

Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.”

He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.

2. Personal Attacks Came Early

Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker.

Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics.

“For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.

3. Trading Barbs Over Trade

Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.

“And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said.

Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”

Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.”

“Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said.

Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”

4. Trump Asks ‘Why Not’ Blame All the World’s Problems on Clinton

Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.”

Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?”

Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“

Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""

5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns

Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.

“I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.

Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said.

“I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?

“Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.

6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage

Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.

At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate.

Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015.

“Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”

7. Clinton Defends Being ‘Prepared’ When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail

Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff.

""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.”

Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.

8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion

Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.

“Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said.

Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.”

“They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal.

Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.

9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope

Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.

“I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”

Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.”

The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?""

Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.”

Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”

10. Sparring Over Stamina

Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.”

""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.”

Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.

""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said.

She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:

In a highly anticipated showdown, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump took the stage for their first general election debate at Hofstra University in New York. The atmosphere was charged as the candidates prepared to engage in a battle of wits and policies, with millions of viewers tuning in to witness the clash of two of the most prominent figures in American politics.

The debate commenced with what appeared to be a cordial handshake, a moment that quickly gave way to an undercurrent of sarcasm and mutual contempt. From the outset, it was clear that both candidates were ready to challenge each other fiercely, setting the tone for a night filled with sharp exchanges and pointed accusations.

Clinton wasted no time in launching an attack on Trump’s business background. She highlighted his reliance on family wealth, stating that he had borrowed $14 million from his father to kickstart his business ventures. This assertion aimed to paint Trump as someone who had not truly earned his success through hard work but rather benefited from privilege.

In response, Trump defended his business acumen, asserting that he had received a ""small loan"" and had subsequently built a multi-billion dollar company. His retort was a clear attempt to shift the narrative, emphasizing his entrepreneurial spirit and the success he claimed to have achieved independently.

The debate soon turned to the contentious issue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Trump accused Clinton of supporting the trade agreement, a claim that she vehemently denied. This exchange highlighted the candidates' differing views on trade and its implications for American workers, a topic that has been central to the election discourse.

As the debate progressed, Trump suggested that Clinton would be held accountable for a range of issues facing the country. Clinton, quick on her feet, quipped about being blamed for everything, a remark that elicited laughter from the audience and showcased her ability to deflect criticism with humor.

The discussion then shifted to Trump's controversial decision not to release his tax returns. He defended this choice by stating that he was currently under audit, a claim that has been met with skepticism by many. In a strategic pivot, Trump seized the opportunity to attack Clinton over her email controversy, attempting to redirect the focus onto her own missteps.

The birther issue, which has long been a point of contention in American politics, was also raised during the debate. Trump, who had spent years questioning President Obama’s citizenship, acknowledged Obama’s legitimacy for the first time. This admission marked a significant moment, as it came after years of Trump perpetuating the unfounded conspiracy theory.

Clinton, facing criticism for her preparation for the debate, defended her approach against Trump’s insinuations that she had been absent from the campaign trail. She emphasized her readiness and experience, countering Trump’s narrative that she was unprepared to face him.

The debate also touched on the controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy, with Trump asserting that it had a positive impact on crime rates in New York City. This claim sparked a heated exchange, as Clinton challenged the effectiveness and implications of such policing strategies, which have been criticized for their disproportionate impact on minority communities.

Another contentious topic was Trump’s stance on the Iraq War. Despite evidence suggesting otherwise, Trump insisted that he did not support the war, a claim that was met with skepticism from Clinton and the audience. This moment underscored the candidates' differing narratives regarding foreign policy and military intervention.

As the debate neared its conclusion, the candidates sparred over the issue of stamina. Trump questioned Clinton's endurance, suggesting that she lacked the physical and mental fortitude required for the presidency. Clinton countered this assertion by highlighting her extensive experience in public service and her ability to withstand the rigors of a demanding campaign. She also took the opportunity to address Trump’s derogatory remarks about women, framing her candidacy as a testament to resilience in the face of adversity.

The first general election debate between Clinton and Trump was a microcosm of the larger political battle unfolding in the United States. With sharp exchanges, personal attacks, and a focus on key issues, the debate set the stage for what promises to be a contentious election season. As both candidates continue to vie for the presidency, the stakes have never been higher, and the American public is left to navigate the complexities of their contrasting visions for the future.",50.0,-23.0,2076.0,0.6024096385542169,0.024084778420038536,849.0,-0.6764705882352942,-0.027090694935217905
Real_16-Webpage,Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

“I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

“It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

“Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",http://abcn.ws/2cTj7ap,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"More Michael,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting3_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting1_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting2_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_12x5_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939,"{""fb_title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""description"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@MichaelEHayden"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:03:26"", ""keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter, us news, national news, local news"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter""}","- Peaceful protesters attended Charlotte's first city council meeting since the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 speakers against police violence.

Charlotte, NC – The first city council meeting since the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott was marked by a powerful display of emotion and calls for justice from peaceful protesters. Over 50 speakers took to the podium to voice their opposition to police violence, highlighting the community's deep-seated frustrations and fears in the wake of the tragic incident.

Among the speakers was a young girl named Zianna Oliphant, whose heartfelt testimony resonated with many in attendance. With tears in her eyes, Zianna spoke about the profound impact of police shootings on children and the pain felt by the black community in Charlotte. Her poignant remarks centered on the loss of parents, as she referenced Scott, a father of seven, and lamented the heartbreaking reality of having to bury loved ones due to violence.

The protests in Charlotte began shortly after news broke of Scott's shooting, igniting a wave of demonstrations across the city. While many of these protests remained peaceful, tensions escalated throughout the week, culminating in confrontations between protesters and law enforcement. Police responded to the unrest with tear gas and rubber bullets, which led to further violence, including instances of looting and the throwing of objects by some demonstrators.

During the city council meeting, Mayor Jennifer Roberts urged attendees to maintain decorum as protesters expressed their frustrations, directing criticism towards both her and Police Chief Kerr Putney. The atmosphere was charged, with emotions running high as community members demanded accountability and transparency from their leaders.

Following the meeting, protesters gathered outside the city hall, chanting for the release of the full video of Scott's shooting. The call for transparency was echoed by Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, who, in an interview, emphasized the need for the complete video to be made public. The partial body and dashboard camera footage released by Chief Putney has left many questions unanswered, particularly regarding whether Scott was armed and if he posed a threat to the officers involved.

The ongoing unrest in Charlotte reflects a broader national conversation about police violence and accountability, particularly within communities of color. As the city grapples with the aftermath of Scott's shooting, the voices of those affected continue to rise, demanding change and justice.

The emotional testimony from young activists like Zianna Oliphant serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of violence and the urgent need for reform. As Charlotte moves forward, the community remains vigilant, advocating for a future where such tragedies are no longer a reality.

The city council's next steps will be closely watched, as residents seek assurance that their concerns are being heard and addressed. The call for the full release of the video is just one of many demands that will shape the ongoing dialogue about policing and community safety in Charlotte.

As the situation continues to unfold, the resilience of the community shines through, with peaceful protests serving as a platform for change. The voices of the people, especially the youngest among them, are a powerful force in the fight for justice and accountability in the wake of tragedy.",-57.0,-32.0,570.0,-2.28,-0.1,587.0,-1.5238095238095237,-0.054514480408858604

Real_18-Webpage,Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night’s big debate: Don’t let Donald Trump get away with it.

And Trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.”

Story Continued Below

The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.”

“The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,” Silver tweeted.

During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.

“We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told “CBS This Morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, “that that simply be checked.”

“The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.

But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump’s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he’s a Democrat and the system is “very unfair.” The “NBC Nightly News” anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.

“I don’t know that he knew what Lester Holt’s voter registration was,” said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. “He didn’t lie,” Conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.”

In a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, Monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn’t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.

But Clinton’s campaign has beat up on Holt’s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. “In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” Janet Brown, the commission’s executive director, told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

For her part, Clinton won’t let Trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn’t, either.

“There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.”

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.

“I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “You can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but I don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.”

Trump’s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp’s preparation for two Trumps.

“We don’t want Donald Trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We’re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” Mook told NBC’s “Today.”

Asked about Clinton’s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that “it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.”

But Conway shot down the notion that there’s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that “Overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and Conway joined the pile-on.

“He’s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,” Conway said. “And that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.”

After Mook warned against “a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” Conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.”

“I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.”

Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.

“I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.

“What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,” Conway said. “Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.”

Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance.

“So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself — and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.

""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""

As the countdown to the highly anticipated presidential debate approaches, the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are ramping up their strategies, each aiming to gain the upper hand in a race that has recently shown signs of tightening. With polls indicating a competitive landscape, both candidates are preparing for a showdown that could significantly impact their chances in the upcoming election.

Clinton's campaign is taking a proactive stance, urging that Trump should not be allowed to mislead the public during the debate. The former Secretary of State's team is particularly concerned about the potential for misinformation, with Clinton's campaign manager expressing apprehension that Trump may resort to falsehoods. In a bid to ensure accountability, they have requested real-time fact-checking from the debate's moderator, Lester Holt. This request underscores the seriousness with which Clinton's team views the importance of accuracy in political discourse, especially in a high-stakes environment like a presidential debate.

In response, Trump's campaign has pushed back against the notion of needing a fact-checking moderator. Trump's campaign manager argues that candidates should be responsible for their own statements, emphasizing that the debate should focus on the candidates' policies and visions rather than on fact-checking. This perspective reflects a broader sentiment within Trump's camp, which has long maintained that the media is biased against him. They accuse Clinton's team of attempting to manipulate the debate to their advantage, framing the request for real-time fact-checking as a tactic to undermine Trump's candidacy.

The debate is set against a backdrop of shifting public opinion, as recent polls reveal a tightening race. In both national and battleground state surveys, Trump is either even with or ahead of Clinton, raising the stakes for both candidates as they prepare to present their cases to the American electorate. The tightening race adds an extra layer of urgency to the debate, as each candidate seeks to solidify their support and sway undecided voters.

Clinton's team has been vocal in their criticism of the media's handling of Trump's previous statements. They have pointed to instances where Holt's colleague failed to challenge Trump on false claims made during a national security forum, highlighting a perceived need for moderators to be more assertive in holding candidates accountable. Clinton's press secretary has insisted that Trump's frequent lies should be called out during the debate, reinforcing the campaign's commitment to transparency and truthfulness in political dialogue.

On the other hand, Trump's former campaign manager has downplayed the importance of fact-checking by moderators, suggesting that the focus should remain on the candidates' performances and their ability to connect with voters. This perspective aligns with Trump's broader strategy of portraying Clinton as robotic and overly scripted, contrasting it with his own image of spontaneity and authenticity. Trump's campaign aims to capitalize on this narrative, presenting their candidate as a relatable figure who speaks directly to the concerns of everyday Americans.

As both campaigns prepare for the debate, they are crafting different versions of their candidates. Clinton's team is focused on avoiding distractions that could arise from Trump's potential misinformation, while also ensuring that she effectively communicates her policy positions. In contrast, Trump's campaign is working to highlight his strengths, encouraging him to be himself and not to feel pressured to compete with Clinton's policy expertise. Rudy Giuliani, a key advisor to Trump, has emphasized the importance of authenticity, urging the candidate to connect with voters on a personal level rather than getting bogged down in policy details.

Amidst these preparations, concerns are being raised about the media narratives that could shape public perceptions of the debate. Both campaigns are acutely aware of the power of media framing and the potential impact it can have on voter opinions. As such, they are strategizing not only for the debate itself but also for the aftermath, anticipating how the media will interpret and report on the candidates' performances.

As the debate looms, the tension between the two campaigns is palpable. With each side preparing to defend their candidate's integrity and challenge the other's credibility, the stage is set for a contentious exchange. The outcome of the debate could prove pivotal in the race for the presidency, making it essential for both candidates to navigate the complexities of the political landscape with skill and precision.

In conclusion, the upcoming debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shaping up to be a critical moment in the 2024 presidential race. With both campaigns adopting contrasting strategies and narratives, the stakes are higher than ever. As voters tune in, they will be watching not only for policy discussions but also for how each candidate handles the pressure of the moment and the scrutiny of their statements. The debate promises to be a defining moment in a campaign that has already been marked by intense rivalry and fierce competition.",-11.0,16.0,2057.0,-0.22,-0.0053475935828877,916.0,0.48484848484848486,0.017467248908296942
Real_19-Webpage,Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?,"I’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I’m pretty much baffled.

The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: “You’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.

Story Continued Below

Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that’s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”)

Further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).

By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump—bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post—but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump—and he's still standing.

Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history.

The Focus Is on “Moments”—But They’re Not Always The Key

Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:

“Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked Americans ‘are you better off?’ Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.”

These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It’s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “You’ve all become theater critics.”)

But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.

The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.

There Are Three Debates, Not One—And That Can Matter A Whole Lot

One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th—barely a week before the election.

Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That’s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.

Here, I think, is an opening for Clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).

Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo

The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.

“Well,” he said, “they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.”

Judo, however, can cut both ways. There’s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.

“Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.”

Debates Are NOT Decisive

One last note. It’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory.

In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.

Of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. So you’ll probably want to tune in anyway

As the nation gears up for the highly anticipated presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the stakes are higher than ever. With extensive experience analyzing presidential debates, it is clear that this matchup will be pivotal in shaping the narrative of the election. Both candidates come with their unique strengths and vulnerabilities, and how they navigate these in the debate could significantly influence their campaigns.

Hillary Clinton enters the debate with a wealth of government experience, a factor that has traditionally been viewed as a strength. However, this experience could be turned into a liability by Trump, who is known for his unconventional approach to political discourse. Trump may employ what can be termed ""political judo,"" a strategy that involves using an opponent's strengths against them. By framing Clinton's extensive qualifications as part of the problem in current political issues, Trump could effectively undermine her credibility and appeal to voters who are disillusioned with the status quo.

One of Trump's primary challenges will be to reassure college-educated white voters who have been hesitant to support him. This demographic, which has shown resistance to his candidacy, mirrors the challenge faced by Ronald Reagan in 1980. Reagan had to win over a skeptical electorate, and Trump finds himself in a similar position. His ability to connect with these voters will be crucial, especially as they are often seen as a key demographic in determining the outcome of the election.

On the other hand, Clinton faces her own set of challenges, particularly regarding the issues of honesty and trustworthiness. Trump has a history of leveraging criticisms from credible sources to question Clinton's integrity. This aspect of the debate could prove to be a significant hurdle for her, as voters increasingly prioritize transparency and authenticity in their candidates. The ability to address these concerns head-on will be vital for Clinton if she hopes to maintain her lead in the polls.

Historical context plays a significant role in understanding the impact of debates. Often, specific moments from debates overshadow the cumulative effect of the exchanges that take place. While memorable quotes or gaffes can dominate the headlines, it is the overall performance that tends to resonate with voters. The presence of Trump in the debate could lead to unprecedented moments that capture the public's attention, but it is essential to remember that the overall narrative and performance will likely be more influential in the long run.

This election cycle features three debates, providing both candidates with opportunities to recover from any initial missteps. The first debate may set the tone, but subsequent performances can shift the dynamics of the race. Candidates often learn from their experiences, and the ability to adapt and respond to their opponent's strategies will be crucial in this high-stakes environment.

Clinton has a unique opportunity to connect personal concerns with her proposals during town hall meetings, which could resonate with voters on a deeper level. By addressing the issues that matter most to the electorate, she can create a narrative that positions her as a candidate who understands and empathizes with their struggles. This approach could help counteract any negative perceptions stemming from Trump's attacks on her experience.

Both candidates have the potential to use political judo against each other. Clinton could challenge Trump's claims of business success, questioning the validity of his accomplishments and framing them in a way that highlights the struggles faced by everyday Americans. This tactic could serve to undermine Trump's appeal as a successful businessman and reinforce Clinton's narrative as a candidate focused on the needs of the people.

It is important to note that debates are not always decisive in determining election outcomes. Other factors, such as economic performance and current events, play a significant role in shaping voter sentiment. While debates can provide a platform for candidates to showcase their policies and personalities, they are just one piece of a much larger puzzle. The current election cycle indicates a close race, making the debates particularly worth watching, as they could provide critical insights into how each candidate plans to navigate the challenges ahead.

As the debate approaches, both Clinton and Trump will undoubtedly be preparing extensively, analyzing potential scenarios and crafting their strategies.

Real_2-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have',"Story highlights ""This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" Clinton said

The deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage in the election

Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.

""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.""

The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.

Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton.

“The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?”

“I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.”

Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race.

“He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”

Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential candidate, has expressed his pride in providing voters with an alternative to the major party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In a recent statement, Johnson emphasized that his campaign is about offering a genuine choice rather than merely presenting a lesser evil. He believes that many voters are seeking a fresh perspective and a ""first vote"" that aligns with their values.

Addressing concerns that his candidacy might spoil the election for Clinton, Johnson confidently dismissed these worries, asserting that his supporters are committed to voting for him specifically. He highlighted a significant trend in the electorate, noting that 50% of new voters are registering as independents. This observation raises questions about the long-standing dominance of the two-party system in American politics.

Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, responded to Johnson's candidacy by downplaying its potential impact on the election. He referenced a recent poll indicating that Johnson's support has dropped to 5%, suggesting that the Libertarian candidate is not a significant threat to the major party candidates. Mook acknowledged that Johnson may be drawing votes from both Clinton and Trump but maintained that third-party candidates are unlikely to have a substantial effect on the overall election outcome.

As the election approaches, Johnson's campaign continues to resonate with a segment of the electorate eager for alternatives, while the major party candidates remain focused on consolidating their bases. The dynamics of this election cycle highlight the ongoing debate about the viability of third-party candidates in a predominantly two-party system.",4.0,6.0,300.0,0.5,0.013333333333333334,295.0,0.5454545454545454,0.020338983050847456

Real_22-Webpage,Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.”

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.”

Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

This week, the Senate reconvened, and Democrats took the opportunity to introduce a significant piece of legislation aimed at enhancing transparency among presidential candidates. Spearheaded by Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the proposed bill mandates that candidates release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving their party's nomination. This initiative seeks to ensure that voters have access to crucial financial information that could influence their electoral decisions.

Under the terms of the bill, if a candidate fails to comply with the requirement to disclose their tax returns, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would be obligated to make those returns public after a 30-day grace period. This provision aims to hold candidates accountable and promote transparency in the electoral process, a principle that many lawmakers believe is essential for a healthy democracy.

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) has indicated that there will be opportunities for the Senate to vote on this bill in the coming week, suggesting that the proposal may gain traction among lawmakers. The push for transparency is not without precedent; historically, many candidates have voluntarily disclosed their tax returns. Notably, both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have made over 30 years of their tax returns public. In stark contrast, only one candidate since 1976, Gerald Ford, has refused to disclose such information.

The issue of tax return transparency has been a contentious topic in past elections. During the 2012 presidential race, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid criticized Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, implying that the limited disclosure suggested Romney was concealing critical financial information. This sentiment was echoed in a Bloomberg News article published shortly before the election, which revealed Romney's substantial income and minimal tax payments, further fueling the debate over transparency.

In the current political landscape, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has recently labeled Donald Trump as ""ethically compromised"" and referred to him as ""the king of the welfare kings."" Reid's comments underscore the growing concern among Democrats regarding Trump's financial dealings and the lack of transparency surrounding his tax returns. The article emphasizes the necessity for voters to have access to Trump's tax return details, arguing that such information is vital for making informed decisions at the ballot box. This call for transparency stands in stark contrast to the financial disclosures made by Hillary Clinton, which have been characterized as thorough and open.

As the Senate prepares to deliberate on the proposed bill, the conversation surrounding the need for transparency in presidential candidates' finances is more relevant than ever. The article concludes with a strong call to action, urging lawmakers to consider the implications of Trump's financial opacity and advocating for his impeachment as a means to address the ethical concerns raised by his lack of disclosure. The outcome of this legislative effort could have lasting implications for the future of presidential elections and the expectations placed on candidates regarding financial transparency.",-9.0,2.0,496.0,-0.6428571428571429,-0.018145161290322582,557.0,0.10526315789473684,0.003590664272890485
Real_23-Webpage,Dem congressman to IRS: Audit the Trump Foundation,"Story highlights Trump reportedly used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes,"" Sander Levin wrote to the IRS

Washington (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen

The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.

The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.

Michigan Democratic Representative Sander Levin has formally requested an audit of The Trump Foundation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This call for scrutiny comes in light of a recent report indicating that former President Donald Trump utilized $258,000 from his charitable organization to settle various lawsuits.

Levin stressed the importance of ensuring that charitable funds are allocated solely for charitable purposes, rather than being diverted for personal business interests. The allegations surrounding Trump's financial dealings have raised significant concerns among Democrats, who have accused him of self-dealing.

According to a report by The Washington Post, Trump settled a $100,000 lawsuit with Palm Beach in 2007 and paid $158,000 in connection with a 2011 lawsuit related to a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament. These revelations have intensified scrutiny of the former president's financial practices and the operations of his foundation.

In response to the unfolding situation, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has advised Hillary Clinton's campaign to exercise caution in leveraging these allegations for political attacks. Christie’s remarks suggest a recognition of the potential backlash that could arise from politicizing the issue.

As the debate continues, the focus remains on the ethical implications of using charitable funds for personal gain, and whether an IRS audit will shed light on the operations of The Trump Foundation.",3.0,4.0,257.0,0.3333333333333333,0.011673151750972763,258.0,0.4444444444444444,0.015503875968992248
Real_24-Webpage,Armed Intruders Break in House…Armed Resident Responds – Eagle Rising,"Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun.

The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway.

After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away.

In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.”

Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.”

In a dramatic incident early Friday morning, around 4:00 AM, three armed men broke into a residence in Atlanta, prompting a swift response from a co-worker present at the scene. The co-worker, armed with a handgun, engaged the intruders, and the entire event was captured on surveillance camera.

As the armed men entered the home, the co-worker fired all rounds at the intruders, successfully causing them to flee the scene. Tragically, one of the intruders sustained fatal gunshot wounds and was found dead in the driveway. The other two suspects managed to escape and remain at large.

Following the confrontation, the homeowner took immediate action to calm his co-worker and safely removed the firearm from the situation. Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington addressed the incident, emphasizing the right of individuals to defend their property. He also noted the significance of the surveillance footage, which is considered rare in such home invasion cases.

Authorities are optimistic that the detailed footage will aid in identifying the two remaining suspects, particularly since they were not wearing masks during the break-in. The investigation is ongoing, and law enforcement is urging anyone with information to come forward as they work to bring the suspects to justice.

Real_25-Webpage,"Post-debate, Trump team hits moderator Holt for 'some hostile questions'","""He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about,"" Donald Trump said about Lester Holt. | Getty Post-debate, Trump team hits moderator Holt for 'some hostile questions'

Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.

“They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.”

Story Continued Below

Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.

“I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.”

“Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.”

Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.

""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.

“I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""

While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.

“I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”

Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado.

“I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”

In the aftermath of a heated presidential debate, former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized debate moderator Lester Holt for what he described as unfair questioning. Trump’s remarks came during a post-debate interview where he expressed his dissatisfaction with Holt's performance, particularly regarding the focus of the questions posed to him and his opponent, Hillary Clinton.

Trump asserted that Holt failed to address significant issues surrounding Clinton, specifically her past scandals, which include the controversial handling of her emails and the Benghazi incident. According to Trump, these topics were crucial to the debate and deserved more attention. He emphasized that while he felt he performed well on the standard questions, he was met with what he termed ""hostile"" inquiries that detracted from the overall discourse.

In his assessment of Holt's performance, Trump rated the moderator a C+. He acknowledged that Holt's initial questions were commendable but criticized the subsequent focus on Trump's past lawsuits, which he felt were irrelevant to the pressing issues at hand. This sentiment was echoed by members of Trump's campaign team, including Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence and senior advisor Kellyanne Conway.

Pence expressed disappointment that key issues related to Clinton were not adequately addressed during the debate. He highlighted the importance of discussing Clinton's controversies, suggesting that the American public deserved clarity on these matters. Conway also voiced her concerns, wishing for a more in-depth discussion on topics such as Benghazi and the operations of the Clinton Foundation, which she believes are critical to understanding Clinton's candidacy.

Adding to the controversy, Trump mentioned that he faced technical difficulties during the debate, specifically citing a defective microphone. He insinuated that this issue may have been tampered with, suggesting that it could have impacted his performance. This claim of a compromised microphone added another layer to his critique of the debate's structure and fairness.

During the debate, Trump noted that he was not particularly rattled by Clinton until she brought up Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe. He defended his past comments about Machado, describing her as difficult to work with during her tenure in the Miss Universe organization. Trump's remarks about Machado have been a point of contention, and he seemed to suggest that her mention was a strategic move by Clinton to provoke him.

As the debate continues to be analyzed by pundits and supporters alike, Trump's criticisms of Holt and the debate format reflect a broader narrative of his campaign strategy. By focusing on perceived injustices in the debate process, Trump aims to rally his base and redirect attention to the issues he believes are vital for voters to consider.

In summary, Trump's post-debate comments highlight his dissatisfaction with the moderation of the debate and the topics that were prioritized. His campaign team’s support for his views underscores a collective strategy to frame the narrative around the debate and emphasize the importance of addressing Clinton's past controversies. As the election season progresses, these discussions will likely continue to shape the dialogue between the candidates and their supporters.",-41.0,-23.0,1119.0,-1.025,-0.03663985701519214,583.0,-1.0454545454545454,-0.03945111492281304

In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.

Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.

From the Daily Mail:

National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.

A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.

On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street.

After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.

A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is currently engulfed in a second night of violent protests following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an armed black suspect. The unrest has prompted Governor Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency as the situation continues to escalate, raising concerns about public safety and order in the city.

The protests erupted after Officer Brentley Vinson shot Scott, with conflicting reports emerging about the circumstances surrounding the incident. While some witnesses claim Scott was armed, others assert he was merely reading a book at the time of the confrontation. This ambiguity has fueled tensions among demonstrators, leading to a volatile atmosphere in the downtown area.

Tragically, the violence has resulted in serious injuries. One protester is critically wounded after being shot in the head by another protester and is currently on life support. In addition, three other protesters and four police officers sustained injuries during the unrest, highlighting the dangerous conditions on the ground.

As the protests intensified, reports surfaced of alarming incidents, including attempts by some protesters to throw a reporter into a fire. Armed individuals were also spotted in vehicles, seemingly for protection amid the chaos. The situation has prompted major companies in the downtown area to advise their employees to avoid the vicinity due to safety concerns, further illustrating the severity of the unrest.

The protests have not only led to injuries but also significant property damage. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and various businesses have been vandalized, with windows broken and looting reported. This destructive behavior has drawn criticism from some individuals who express frustration with the violence among protesters, contrasting with those who continue to engage in acts of vandalism.

In response to the escalating violence, police have deployed flash grenades and tear gas to disperse crowds, which has only led to further chaos as protesters retaliated with projectiles. The situation has become increasingly difficult for law enforcement, who are now receiving assistance from National Guard troops deployed to help restore order.

Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering implementing a curfew in an effort to regain control of the situation. The potential curfew reflects the city's urgent need to address the unrest and protect both residents and businesses from further violence.

As the protests continue, the community remains divided. While many are rallying for justice in the wake of Scott's shooting, the violent actions of some protesters have overshadowed the message of peaceful demonstration. The ongoing unrest raises critical questions about the relationship between law enforcement and the community, as well as the broader issues of race and justice in America.

The situation in Charlotte remains fluid, with tensions high and the potential for further violence looming. As the city grapples with the aftermath of the police shooting and the subsequent protests, the hope for a peaceful resolution hangs in the balance. The coming days will be crucial in determining the path forward for Charlotte and its residents as they seek to heal and address the underlying issues that have led to this moment of crisis.",-82.0,-58.0,674.0,-2.484848484848485,-0.12166172106824925,570.0,-2.4166666666666665,-0.10175438596491228

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked Rouhani whether he'd rather work with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. Rouhani said, ""Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.

Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.

In a recent statement, Rouhani addressed inquiries regarding his preferences between presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump concerning the future of the nuclear agreement.

Rouhani pointed out that U.S. presidential candidates often leverage significant topics, such as the nuclear deal, to align with their campaign strategies. He underscored the importance of the JCPOA, highlighting that it is an international agreement that received unanimous approval from the United Nations Security Council.

The contrasting positions of the candidates on the deal are notable. Donald Trump has been a vocal critic, labeling the agreement a ""bad deal"" and expressing intentions to dismantle it if elected. In contrast, Hillary Clinton has indicated that she would respect the deal but would approach Iran with caution, adopting a ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

Rouhani further remarked that discussions surrounding the potential renegotiation of the agreement are largely driven by electoral motivations rather than genuine diplomatic concerns. As the U.S. election approaches, the future of the nuclear deal remains a pivotal issue, with both candidates framing their positions to resonate with voters.

Real_28-Webpage,“How Can we LEAD When we Can’t Even Control Our Own Cities?” [VIDEO] – Eagle Rising,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said:

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.

“Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.

“Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?

“We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.

“Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.

“The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.

“There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.

“Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.”

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – In a campaign speech delivered on Thursday, former President Donald Trump addressed the growing national unrest following a series of officer-involved shootings that have sparked protests across the country. Speaking to a crowd of supporters, Trump emphasized the critical need for unity and togetherness in America, particularly during these challenging times.

“Now more than ever, we must come together as a nation,” Trump stated, underscoring the importance of solidarity for achieving national goals and overcoming adversity. He urged Americans to respect the flag and work collaboratively, advocating for a united nation grounded in shared values and principles.

The former president expressed his concern regarding the unrest in cities such as Charlotte, noting that the turmoil reflects poorly on the United States as a global leader. “We cannot allow our cities to be torn apart by violence and chaos,” he said, highlighting the need for a collective effort to restore peace and order.

While affirming the right to peaceful assembly, Trump condemned the violent disruptions that threaten public safety. “Every American deserves to live in a safe community,” he declared, calling for an end to violence that endangers both citizens and law enforcement. He pointed out that law-abiding African-American residents in affected communities are often the ones who suffer the most from riots, as such unrest impacts their jobs, housing, and education.

“The government’s primary duty is to protect the wellbeing and safety of its residents,” Trump asserted, emphasizing that the administration must prioritize the needs of those who are striving for a better life. He argued that tolerating lawlessness is not an act of compassion, stating firmly that crime and violence will not be accepted under his leadership.

In his speech, Trump highlighted the importance of supporting families who are working hard to provide peaceful lives and quality education for their children. He called on Americans to rally around these families, reinforcing the idea that a united front is essential for fostering a safe and prosperous society.

As the nation grapples with ongoing tensions and divisions, Trump’s message resonated with many in the audience who are eager for a return to stability and safety. His call for unity and respect for law enforcement was met with applause, reflecting a shared desire among supporters for a more harmonious community.

The former president’s remarks come at a time when the country is facing significant challenges, and his emphasis on shared values and principles aims to inspire a collective response to the unrest. By advocating for a united nation, Trump seeks to position himself as a leader who prioritizes the safety and wellbeing of all Americans, particularly those in communities most affected by violence.

As the campaign season heats up, Trump’s focus on unity and public safety is likely to play a central role in his messaging, appealing to voters who are concerned about the current state of the nation. With the upcoming election on the horizon, his call for togetherness may resonate with those seeking a leader who can navigate the complexities of a divided America.

In conclusion, Trump’s speech in Pittsburgh served as a rallying cry for unity, emphasizing the need for Americans to come together in the face of adversity. His commitment to public safety and support for families striving for a better future underscores his vision for a united and prosperous nation.",-5.0,30.0,540.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.009259259259259259,642.0,1.4285714285714286,0.04672897196261682
Real_29-Webpage,9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him,"""Donald, you’re a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him

Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.

That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father.

Story Continued Below

1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection

In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.”

“The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’”

2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward”

Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.”

“It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said.

3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully”

“Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said . “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.”

4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women”

Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.”

5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky”

In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.”

6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth”

Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.”

7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said

“I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said .

8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer”

Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’

And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.”

9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family

“I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.

Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.

In a surprising political twist, Senator Ted Cruz has officially endorsed Donald Trump for the upcoming presidential election, just two months after facing a chorus of boos at the Republican National Convention for his refusal to support the former president. This endorsement marks a significant shift in Cruz's stance, especially considering the tumultuous history of insults and accusations exchanged between the two prominent figures in the Republican Party.

Cruz's endorsement comes on the heels of a series of public spats that have characterized their relationship over the past few years. The senator has not held back in expressing his disdain for Trump, particularly in response to the former president's personal attacks on Cruz's family. Trump's derogatory remarks about Cruz's wife and father have been particularly incendiary, prompting Cruz to label Trump a ""big, loud New York bully."" This characterization reflects Cruz's frustration with Trump's willingness to engage in personal attacks, especially those targeting spouses and children.

In February, Cruz speculated that Trump's tax returns might reveal connections to organized crime, suggesting that the former president was hiding something significant. This assertion was part of a broader narrative in which Cruz painted Trump as a figure shrouded in mystery and dishonesty. Just a month later, Cruz escalated his rhetoric, calling Trump a ""sniveling coward"" for threatening to ""spill the beans"" on Cruz's wife. This incident underscored Cruz's belief that family attacks are unacceptable, further deepening the rift between the two men.

Cruz's criticisms of Trump did not stop there. He described Trump as ""a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women,"" a remark that highlights Cruz's perception of Trump's character. This sentiment was echoed in May when Cruz dismissed Trump's claims regarding his father's alleged involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as ""nuts"" and ""kooky."" Such comments illustrate Cruz's willingness to challenge Trump's more outlandish assertions, positioning himself as a voice of reason amidst the chaos of political discourse.

Moreover, Cruz has accused Trump of being a ""pathological liar,"" asserting that the former president lies constantly and projects his dishonesty onto others. This accusation is particularly striking, given that Cruz himself has now chosen to endorse the very man he once labeled as utterly amoral. Cruz's characterization of Trump as someone who could pass a lie detector test while contradicting himself speaks to the senator's deep-seated concerns about Trump's integrity and moral compass.

In addition to these accusations, Cruz has also labeled Trump a narcissist, claiming that he is a narcissist unlike any seen before. This assertion is compounded by Cruz's description of Trump as a ""serial philanderer"" who takes pride in his infidelities. Such remarks paint a picture of a man who, in Cruz's eyes, embodies the worst traits of political leadership.

Despite the harsh words exchanged between the two, Cruz's endorsement of Trump raises questions about the motivations behind this sudden shift. In July, Cruz expressed that he was not inclined to support someone who attacks his family, indicating that the wounds from their previous encounters were still fresh. However, the political landscape is ever-changing, and Cruz's endorsement may signal a strategic move to align himself with the party's frontrunner as the election approaches.

The endorsement has sparked a flurry of reactions from both supporters and critics of Cruz and Trump. Many within the Republican Party are left wondering how Cruz reconciles his previous statements with his current support for Trump. The endorsement could be seen as a pragmatic decision, aimed at unifying the party and consolidating support ahead of a contentious election cycle.

As the political climate continues to evolve, Cruz's endorsement serves as a reminder of the complexities and contradictions that often characterize political alliances. The relationship between Cruz and Trump is emblematic of a broader trend within the Republican Party, where personal animosities can be set aside in favor of political expediency. 

In conclusion, Ted Cruz's endorsement of Donald Trump is a notable development in the ongoing saga of their contentious relationship. From insults and accusations to a surprising show of support, the dynamics between these two political figures highlight the intricate web of loyalty, rivalry, and strategy that defines modern politics. As the election draws nearer, it remains to be seen how this endorsement will impact both Cruz's political future and the broader landscape of the Republican Party.",-40.0,0.0,974.0,-1.2903225806451613,-0.04106776180698152,849.0,0.0,0.0

Wake County is the fourth county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties.

Washington (CNN)

Few counties could prove more decisive in this election than Wake County, North Carolina.

A historically competitive county whose fortunes are on the rise, Wake could help deliver Hillary Clinton a win in a key battleground state -- or dash her hopes for the presidency. Simply put, if Clinton performs well in the highly educated research triangle, then election night bodes well for her. If Wake County doesn't come out for Clinton, Donald Trump's path to the White House would grow much clearer.

The county is rapidly expanding, and the influx of new people and industries could reshape the race. Meanwhile, the turmoil across the state in Charlotte after a police officer shot and killed a black man could add another focal point in the election — search data from Google Trends shows Wake County's spiking interest in ""police brutality"" this week.

Keep your eye on Wake County, and take a look at the fundamentals below.

Population

Wake County is fairly representative of the country in terms of race and ethnicity, but it has a more highly educated population, bigger incomes and a better job picture than the rest of the nation.

President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

“What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.”

“That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.

The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.

“Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”

In a notable moment at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, President Barack Obama broke an unofficial rule regarding presidential headgear. During his remarks, he was presented with a hat and a blanket from Native American leaders, gifts that he graciously accepted.

While Obama donned the blanket around his shoulders, he opted to remove the hat shortly after receiving it. Expressing his gratitude, he acknowledged the significance of the gifts, referencing the honor song and the blanket's cultural importance. In a light-hearted moment, he joked about needing the blanket for First Lady Michelle Obama, humorously suggesting it would prevent her from taking it from him.

Reflecting on his eight years in office, Obama took the opportunity to highlight the friendships he has developed with various communities, emphasizing the importance of these connections. His decision to wear the blanket, while momentarily breaking the norm, underscored the significance of the event and the relationships fostered throughout his presidency.

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.

“Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.”

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.”

“We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.

Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”

But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.

“I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.

As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

In a recent interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton underscored the profound implications of the upcoming election, asserting that it will significantly shape the next 50 years of America. Clinton's remarks come at a pivotal moment as the nation gears up for a highly contested presidential race, with the first debate between her and her opponent, Donald Trump, scheduled for Monday in New York.

Clinton specifically called on black voters to engage actively in the electoral process, emphasizing that “every issue they care about is at stake in this election.” Her passionate plea highlighted the critical nature of voter turnout, as she urged listeners to check their voter registration status and ensure their voices are heard. “We need everyone to stand up and be counted,” she stated, reinforcing the importance of participation in shaping the future of the country.

Her comments echoed sentiments expressed by former President Barack Obama, who has also been vocal about the significance of the upcoming election. Obama pointed out that various social issues are on the ballot, further amplifying the urgency for voters to make their choices known.

As the election approaches, Clinton is bracing for what she anticipates will be aggressive attacks from Trump during the debate. She expressed confidence in her ability to respond clearly and fearlessly to any challenges that may arise. “I’m ready for whatever he throws at me,” Clinton remarked, indicating her preparedness for the high-stakes confrontation.

Clinton did not shy away from condemning Trump’s past behavior, particularly his derogatory remarks aimed at various groups, including African-Americans, immigrants, and women. She described these insults as “intolerable,” reinforcing her commitment to advocating for inclusivity and respect in political discourse.

As the interview concluded, Trump took to Twitter to mock Clinton, suggesting that she was taking the day off in preparation for the debate. This exchange highlights the contentious atmosphere surrounding the election, with both candidates engaging in a battle of words as they vie for the support of the American electorate.

With the election drawing near, Clinton’s emphasis on the importance of voter engagement resonates strongly, particularly among communities that have historically faced challenges in the political arena. Her call to action serves as a reminder of the power of the ballot and the critical role that every voter plays in determining the direction of the nation.

As the first debate looms, all eyes will be on Clinton and Trump, with voters eager to see how the candidates address the pressing issues that will shape America’s future. The stakes are high, and Clinton’s message is clear: participation in the electoral process is not just a right but a responsibility that can influence the course of history for generations to come.",7.0,14.0,524.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013358778625954198,535.0,0.8235294117647058,0.026168224299065422

Story Continued Below

So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.

Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.

Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as “another Hitler.” She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.

In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.

That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.

It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin’s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did—an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing Russians,” a doubly illegal act of war.

Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.

***

John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, “Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.” Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.

But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.” Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.”

Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.

“Our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.”

He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. “All this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.”

John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.

The legacy of JFK & RFK is “being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party.”

Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.

Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.

Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.

Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime “existential” threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be “existential” enemy.

There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.

Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.”

Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.

But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.

For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.

And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.

***

So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.

We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.

President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future.

Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.

But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.

Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.

Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “There can be no business as usual with Russia.”

Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.

And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:

Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.

Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.

Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.

This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.

Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.

Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.

Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

**Introduction**

In a surprising turn of events, Adam Walinsky, a lifelong Democrat and former aide to Presidents John and Robert Kennedy, has announced his intention to support Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. This decision marks a significant departure from his long-standing political affiliations and raises questions about the evolving landscape of American politics. Walinsky's journey reflects a deep-seated discontent with the current Democratic Party and a desire for a return to the peace-oriented principles that characterized the Kennedy administration.

**A Legacy of Service**

Adam Walinsky's political career began in the shadow of the Kennedy brothers, where he served as a legislative assistant and speechwriter during their respective campaigns. His work under John and Robert Kennedy was marked by a commitment to progressive ideals and a focus on peace. The Kennedys were known for their efforts to navigate the complexities of international relations while prioritizing diplomacy over military intervention. This legacy has profoundly influenced Walinsky's political philosophy and his current critique of the Democratic Party.

**The 1970 New York State Elections**

In 1970, Walinsky took a bold step by running on a Democratic ticket in New York state elections. His candidacy was a reflection of his dedication to the party and its values at the time. However, as the political landscape shifted over the decades, Walinsky found himself increasingly at odds with the direction the Democratic Party was taking, particularly regarding its approach to foreign policy.

**A Shift in Political Stance**

Walinsky's decision to support Donald Trump is rooted in his belief that the current Democratic Party has strayed far from the principles that once guided it. He has publicly criticized the party for becoming what he describes as the ""Party of War."" This characterization stands in stark contrast to the peace-focused legacy of the Kennedys, which Walinsky holds dear. He argues that the party has embraced military interventions and escalated conflicts, moving away from the ideals of diplomacy and cooperation that were hallmarks of the Kennedy administration.

**Critique of Democratic Leadership**

In his critique, Walinsky has not shied away from calling out prominent Democratic figures, including Hillary Clinton. He accuses them of promoting policies that lead to military interventions rather than pursuing peaceful resolutions to conflicts. This criticism underscores a broader disillusionment with the party's leadership and its willingness to engage in warfare, which Walinsky believes undermines the very foundation of American values.

**Trump's Approach to Foreign Policy**

One of the key reasons Walinsky cites for his support of Donald Trump is the latter's willingness to engage with Russia and seek collaboration against terrorism. In an era marked by increasing tensions between the United States and Russia, Walinsky views Trump's approach as a refreshing departure from the confrontational stance that has characterized much of American foreign policy in recent years. He believes that fostering cooperation with other nations is essential for addressing global challenges, particularly the threat of terrorism.

**Acknowledging Imperfections**

While Walinsky acknowledges Trump's imperfections, he emphasizes the former president's political courage and independence from the entrenched interests of Washington's war hawks. This independence, he argues, is crucial for a leader who seeks to prioritize peace and diplomacy over military action. Walinsky's support for Trump is not an endorsement of all his policies but rather a recognition of the need for a different approach to governance—one that aligns more closely with the ideals of peace and cooperation.

**Reflections on the Kennedys' Commitment to Peace**

Walinsky often reflects on the commitment to peace that defined the Kennedy administration. He recalls the efforts made by John and Robert Kennedy to avoid war and promote diplomacy, contrasting this with the current military policies that he believes have led the nation astray. The Kennedys' legacy serves as a guiding principle for Walinsky as he navigates the complexities of contemporary politics.

**The Dangers of a New Cold War**

In his discussions about foreign policy, Walinsky warns against the dangers of a new Cold War. He believes that the current geopolitical climate, marked by rising tensions and military posturing, poses significant risks to global stability. Instead of escalating conflicts, Walinsky advocates for prioritizing domestic peace and security, arguing that the United States should focus on improving conditions within its own borders rather than engaging in unnecessary wars abroad.

**A Call for Change**

Walinsky's call for an end to unnecessary wars resonates with many Americans who are weary of prolonged military engagements. He urges a return to the wisdom of America's founders, advocating for cooperation with nations like Russia and China in the fight against terrorism. This perspective reflects a desire for a more pragmatic approach to foreign policy—one that prioritizes diplomacy and collaboration over confrontation.

**Conclusion: A Vision for a Peaceful America**

In conclusion, Adam Walinsky's shift in political allegiance from a lifelong Democrat to a supporter of Donald Trump underscores a profound discontent with the current state of the Democratic Party. His critique of the party's embrace of militarism and his call for a return to the peace-oriented principles of the Kennedy administration highlight a growing divide within American politics. As Walinsky advocates for a more peaceful and domestically focused America, his journey serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges that define the contemporary political landscape. Whether his support for Trump will resonate with a broader audience remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly reflects a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of American political identity.",-120.0,43.0,3840.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.03125,1045.0,1.1944444444444444,0.04114832535885168

As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.

Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.

From the Independent Review Journal:

But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:

People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474655224000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer4.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer1.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer2.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer3.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer5.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters."", ""title"": ""NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte - But It Wasn't To Protest The National Anthem... | John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 750, ""identifier"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg"", ""height"": 563}, ""url"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""always"", ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 1631890973779575, ""pages"": 389658314427637}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Black Lives Matter"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-23T14:27:04-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/terresamonroe""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- NC State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters, contrasting with Colin Kaepernick's protest against police prejudice.

In a powerful display of faith and community, North Carolina State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters, a poignant contrast to the protests initiated by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick against police prejudice. This moment, captured in a photograph that quickly went viral, has resonated with many, highlighting the troopers' commitment to their community and their reliance on faith during turbulent times.

The backdrop of this prayerful act was the unrest following the officer-involved shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which had sparked protests and unrest in the city. As tensions escalated, reports indicated that radicals were bused into Charlotte with the intent to incite chaos. However, the troopers' decision to kneel in prayer played a significant role in maintaining a sense of peace during the protests, allowing for a more constructive dialogue rather than escalating violence.

The North Carolina Troopers Association shared the viral photo, encouraging the public to support the troopers as they worked diligently to protect the city. This call for support was echoed by many individuals across the country who also knelt in prayer, emphasizing a message of unity that transcended racial divides. The collective act of kneeling served as a reminder that faith can be a unifying force, even in the face of division and unrest.

While the troopers focused on prayer, the article also criticized the actions of rioters, suggesting that they were being manipulated by Marxist influences. This perspective highlights a growing concern among some community members regarding the motivations behind certain protests and the potential for outside forces to exacerbate tensions.

In the midst of these challenges, the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team was present in Charlotte, providing support and faith-based assistance to those affected by the unrest. Their involvement underscored the importance of spiritual guidance and community support during times of crisis, reinforcing the idea that faith can be a source of strength and resilience.

The author of the article expressed pride in the police officers for prioritizing prayer and faith over violence and division. This sentiment reflects a broader appreciation for law enforcement's efforts to foster peace and understanding in a time when many communities are grappling with complex issues surrounding race and justice.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to evolve, the image of the troopers kneeling in prayer stands as a testament to the power of faith in the face of adversity. It serves as a reminder that, even amidst chaos, there are those who choose to respond with compassion and a commitment to community well-being. The hope is that this spirit of unity and understanding can inspire others to seek peaceful resolutions and foster a sense of togetherness, regardless of the challenges that lie ahead.

In conclusion, the actions of the North Carolina State Troopers in Charlotte have sparked a conversation about the role of faith in public life and the importance of community solidarity. As the nation reflects on the events in Charlotte, the image of prayerful troopers may serve as a beacon of hope, encouraging individuals to come together in pursuit of peace and understanding.",3.0,36.0,580.0,0.1,0.005172413793103448,574.0,1.894736842105263,0.0627177700348432

Real_35-Webpage,Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games.

Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.

Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.

""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.

While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.

During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!""

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe may be facing disciplinary action following her decision to kneel during the national anthem at a recent match. The incident occurred during the U.S. team's game against the Netherlands on September 18, where Rapinoe took a knee to protest against injustice and oppression in the United States.

U.S. Soccer has made it clear that players and coaches are expected to stand during the national anthem, emphasizing the organization's values and the importance of honoring the flag. Rapinoe's actions have drawn the ire of U.S. Soccer officials, who argue that her protest contradicts the principles the organization stands for.

Rapinoe's decision to kneel is rooted in her solidarity with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who famously protested against police brutality and racial prejudice. By taking a knee, Rapinoe aims to raise awareness about these critical issues and advocate for change. Despite the backlash she faced from some fans during the game, including one who shouted, ""Stand up!"" Rapinoe remains resolute in her commitment to her cause.

While U.S. Soccer has not imposed immediate punishment on Rapinoe, they have indicated that her situation will be re-evaluated if she continues to kneel during the anthem. This uncertainty looms over her future participation in matches, as the organization seeks to uphold its expectations for player conduct.

Rapinoe has made it clear that she intends to continue her protest, even if it means risking suspension. She has expressed her determination to use her platform and voice to advocate for justice and equality, positioning herself as an ally in the ongoing fight against systemic injustice.

As the situation develops, the intersection of sports and activism remains a focal point of discussion. Rapinoe's actions have sparked conversations about the role of athletes in social movements and the responsibilities they hold to their organizations and fans. The outcome of this situation could have significant implications for both Rapinoe's career and the broader landscape of athlete activism in the United States.

In a time when social justice issues are at the forefront of national discourse, Rapinoe's willingness to stand up for her beliefs, even in the face of potential consequences, highlights the ongoing struggle for equality and the power of sports as a platform for change.",0.0,5.0,421.0,0.0,0.0,428.0,0.3125,0.011682242990654205

It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed.

Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing.

Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.

Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.”

Below is the offending post:

“I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??”

After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.

Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people.

Brody Jenner, a well-known reality star and son of Caitlyn Jenner, has ignited a firestorm of controversy on social media following his recent comments regarding police shootings. In a Twitter post that has since drawn significant attention, Jenner asserted that not every incident involving law enforcement should be viewed through the lens of race. He included the phrase ""All Lives Matter,"" a statement that has been widely criticized in discussions surrounding racial justice and police violence.

In his post, Jenner expressed his frustration with the media's portrayal of police interactions, emphasizing the importance of complying with police orders, irrespective of an individual's race. He questioned the rationale behind exiting a vehicle while armed, suggesting that individuals should make it clear if they are unarmed to avoid misunderstandings during police encounters. His remarks have sparked a heated debate, with many interpreting his comments as dismissive of the systemic issues surrounding race and policing in America.

The backlash against Jenner was swift and intense, particularly from liberal commentators and activists who took issue with his perspective. Critics pointed out that as a white, straight, cis-gender man, Jenner's views may not fully encapsulate the experiences of marginalized communities, particularly those who have faced discrimination and violence at the hands of law enforcement. This criticism highlights the ongoing tensions in discussions about race, privilege, and the complexities of police interactions.

In response to the backlash, Jenner took to Instagram to further clarify his stance, but his follow-up post only seemed to aggravate his critics further. Many felt that his comments failed to acknowledge the broader context of racial inequality and the historical injustices faced by people of color in their interactions with law enforcement. The situation has sparked a wider conversation about the responsibilities of public figures in discussing sensitive topics such as race and policing.

As the debate continues, Jenner's comments serve as a reminder of the complexities surrounding discussions of race, law enforcement, and societal expectations. The reactions to his statements reflect a broader societal divide on these issues, with many advocating for a more nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by different communities in their interactions with police.

The controversy surrounding Brody Jenner's comments underscores the ongoing struggle for racial justice and the importance of listening to diverse perspectives in these critical conversations. As public discourse evolves, the implications of Jenner's statements will likely continue to resonate, prompting further discussions about race, privilege, and the role of individuals in advocating for change.",-17.0,-15.0,476.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.03571428571428571,474.0,-0.9375,-0.03164556962025317

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.”

Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past.

Story Continued Below

“Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.”

The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].”

Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.”

“I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”

In a recent statement, Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, voiced her strong criticism of former President Donald Trump for his failure to apologize for his involvement in the ""birther"" movement, which questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama. Brazile characterized Trump's actions as a ""wound that won't heal,"" emphasizing the painful legacy of race relations in America.

Brazile's remarks come in the wake of a presidential debate where Trump was confronted about his past claims regarding Obama's birthplace. Instead of taking responsibility, Trump deflected the blame onto Hillary Clinton, asserting that he played a pivotal role in prompting Obama to release his birth certificate. This deflection has drawn ire from many, including Brazile, who believes that such discussions only serve to deepen the racial divides in the country.

Reflecting on her own experiences, Brazile recounted a visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, where she was struck by the historical struggles faced by her ancestors. She linked her family's history to the broader narrative of African Americans who have often faced challenges in obtaining documentation, such as birth certificates. This lack of documentation has had a profound emotional impact on her family, a sentiment that Brazile articulated with palpable emotion.

The interim chairwoman expressed her frustration over the generational consequences of this issue, noting that the absence of birth certificates has left lasting scars on her family. Brazile's personal connection to the topic underscores the broader implications of the birther movement, which she argues continues to perpetuate a deep racial wound in the nation.

While Brazile acknowledged that she does not expect an apology from Trump, she emphasized the shame associated with his ongoing remarks about the birther issue. She believes that as long as such topics are exploited for political gain, the wounds of racial division will remain unhealed. Brazile's comments serve as a reminder of the importance of acknowledging and addressing the historical injustices that continue to affect communities across the United States.

In her critique, Brazile highlighted the need for a more constructive dialogue around race and citizenship, one that does not rely on divisive rhetoric. She called for a collective effort to heal the wounds of the past, urging leaders to take responsibility for their words and actions. The birther movement, in her view, is not just a political issue but a reflection of deeper societal challenges that require thoughtful engagement and understanding.

As the nation continues to grapple with its complex history of race, Brazile's insights resonate with many who seek to foster a more inclusive and equitable society. Her call for accountability and healing serves as a poignant reminder of the work that lies ahead in addressing the legacies of racism and division that persist in contemporary discourse. 

In conclusion, Donna Brazile's reflections on the birther movement and its implications for race relations in America highlight the ongoing struggle for recognition and respect within the political landscape. Her emotional connection to her family's history underscores the need for a more compassionate approach to discussions about race, citizenship, and the legacy of past injustices.",-17.0,-7.0,540.0,-1.0,-0.03148148148148148,593.0,-0.35,-0.011804384485666104
Real_38-Webpage,US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike,"(CNN) The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.

Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials.

That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.

Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.

But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

“This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.”

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

“If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.”

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

“That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.”

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

In a bold move during the recent Emmy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel seized the opportunity to deliver pointed critiques of former President Donald Trump and his supporters, captivating a large audience with his sharp wit. Kimmel's remarks came as part of a broader commentary on Hollywood's elite and the ongoing theme of diversity, which was prominently featured among the nominees at this year's ceremony.

Kimmel's humor took a satirical turn as he suggested that without the influence of television, Trump would likely not be pursuing a presidential run. Instead, he quipped, the former president would be at home with his wife, enjoying a quieter life away from the political spotlight. This jab underscored Kimmel's belief that television played a pivotal role in shaping Trump's public persona and political ambitions.

The host did not shy away from placing blame for Trump's rise to fame squarely on the shoulders of Mark Burnett, the creator of the reality television show ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Kimmel's comments highlighted the significant impact that reality TV has had on American culture and politics, suggesting that Burnett's show was instrumental in catapulting Trump into the national consciousness.

In a particularly humorous moment, Kimmel proposed that if Trump were to build a wall, Burnett should be the first person tossed over it. This tongue-in-cheek suggestion served to emphasize Kimmel's belief that Burnett's role in Trump's ascent was not only significant but also deserving of a playful reprimand.

Kimmel's remarks resonated with many in the audience, who appreciated the blend of humor and social commentary. By addressing the intersection of entertainment and politics, Kimmel not only entertained viewers but also sparked conversations about the influence of media figures in shaping public opinion and political landscapes.

As the Emmys celebrated the achievements of diverse talent in the industry, Kimmel's critiques served as a reminder of the ongoing cultural conversations surrounding representation and the responsibilities of those in the entertainment world. His ability to weave humor with pointed commentary made for a memorable evening, leaving a lasting impression on both attendees and viewers alike.",13.0,29.0,391.0,0.7222222222222222,0.03324808184143223,398.0,2.230769230769231,0.0728643216080402

Real_41-Webpage,Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business',"During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump’s debate performance Monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.""

Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""

""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'You’re fired.' They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.""

During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way.""

""When you’re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump.

The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart.""

""He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.

""If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord,"" Biden said about the debate. ""What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.""",http://abcn.ws/2d3YEVr,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"Abc News,More Arlette",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382,"{""fb_title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""description"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@arlettesaenz"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:43:23"", ""keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate""}","- Vice President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's debate performance during a rally in Philadelphia.

In a spirited rally held in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden took aim at former President Donald Trump's recent debate performance, expressing deep concern over Trump's comments regarding the ongoing housing crisis. Biden's remarks were a direct challenge to Trump's moral values, which he argued are fundamentally misaligned with the principles that have historically guided American leadership.

Biden emphasized that past presidents, including those from the Republican Party, have maintained a moral center that reflects American values and rights. He urged the crowd to envision a scenario where a figure like Ronald Reagan would endorse the exploitation of individuals suffering from economic hardship. This rhetorical question served to underline Biden's belief that Trump's approach is not only un-American but also devoid of the empathy that should characterize a leader.

The Vice President pointed to a specific moment from the debate where Trump was accused by Hillary Clinton of ""rooting for a housing market collapse."" In response, Trump had claimed that such a situation was ""good business."" Biden seized on this statement to highlight a troubling disconnect between Trump's considerable wealth and the everyday struggles faced by ordinary Americans. He argued that Trump's perspective reflects a lack of understanding and sensitivity towards the challenges that many citizens endure.

Biden further condemned Trump's assertion that not paying taxes is a sign of intelligence, arguing that such a viewpoint disrespects the hardworking Americans who fulfill their tax obligations. This comment resonated with the crowd, as Biden expressed his anger over Trump's dismissive attitude towards the sacrifices made by the average citizen.

Throughout his speech, Biden's tone was one of frustration and urgency, as he articulated the implications of Trump's views for the American public. He expressed concern that Trump's cynicism could have dire consequences in the context of the upcoming election, suggesting that such attitudes could undermine the very fabric of American democracy.

As the rally concluded, Biden's message was clear: he believes that the values and sensibilities shared by most American politicians are at risk under Trump's leadership. The Vice President's critique of Trump's debate performance was not just a commentary on a single event, but rather a broader indictment of what he perceives as a troubling trend in American politics. With the election looming, Biden's rally served as a clarion call for voters to consider the moral implications of their choices at the ballot box.",-5.0,-19.0,453.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.011037527593818985,461.0,-1.1875,-0.04121475054229935
Real_42-Webpage,National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6,"Story highlights Hillary Clinton has a 6-point lead over Donald Trump in a four way race, according to a new poll

Clinton has the edge over Trump on a number of key issues in the poll ahead of the first presidential debate

(CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.

The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.

Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.

Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.

Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament.

Real_43-Webpage,“Public School Forced My Child To,"7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

“Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.”

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

“During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.”

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

“Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.”

It referenced the jihad as,

“a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years.

A public high school in Maryland, La Plata High School, is facing serious allegations of indoctrinating students with Islamic teachings. The accusations have emerged in a lawsuit filed by John and Melissa Wood, represented by the Thomas More Law Center. The Woods claim that their daughter was subjected to a curriculum that not only mandated the recitation of the Islamic statement of faith, known as the Shahada, but also required students to memorize the five pillars of Islam.

John Wood has voiced his concerns about the school's teachings, stating that he was banned from school property after raising these issues. Richard Thompson, President of the Thomas More Law Center, has echoed Wood's sentiments, asserting that Wood's daughter was compelled to disparage her Christian faith during the course of her education.

The lawsuit posits that the act of reciting the Shahada is tantamount to conversion for non-Muslim students, raising significant concerns about the implications of such practices in a public school setting. The Woods argue that the instruction provided on Christianity was not only inadequate but also included disparaging remarks about the Christian faith and the Pope, further fueling their claims of religious bias.

According to the lawsuit, the treatment of students in the classroom promotes one religion over another, which the Woods argue is a violation of their constitutional rights. The allegations suggest that classroom materials presented a narrative that most Muslims possess a stronger faith than the average Christian, while also portraying Islam as a peaceful religion. Handouts reportedly aimed to clarify misconceptions about jihad, emphasizing that the majority of Muslims do not support violence.

The alleged indoctrination is said to have occurred during the 2014-2015 school year, raising concerns about the potential for ongoing teachings that may continue to influence students. The lawsuit names several individuals, including Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and the Board of Education, but Charles County Public Schools have yet to comment on the matter.

The case has drawn attention from various organizations, although the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation have not provided any comments regarding the lawsuit. The Woods' allegations highlight a growing concern among parents and community members about the balance of religious teachings in public education and the potential for indoctrination.

As the lawsuit unfolds, it raises critical questions about the role of public schools in teaching religious beliefs and the extent to which they can engage with various faiths without infringing on the rights of students and their families. The outcome of this case may have significant implications for how religious education is approached in public schools across the nation. 

As the community awaits further developments, the situation at La Plata High School serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between education and religious expression in a diverse society.",-5.0,-18.0,511.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.009784735812133072,527.0,-1.0588235294117647,-0.03415559772296015

Real_47-Webpage,KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism,"“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can’t I?

Rock legend Gene Simmons, best known as the iconic frontman of the band KISS, has made headlines with his controversial comments regarding Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the man convicted of the 2016 bombings in New York and New Jersey. In a recent interview with TMZ, Simmons stated that Rahimi ""should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend,"" a remark that has sparked discussions about the intersection of celebrity opinions and serious criminal matters.

Simmons, who has transitioned from rock star to cultural icon and reality TV personality, is known for his appeal to conservative audiences, particularly among NASCAR fans and patriotic Americans. His comments come amid a broader conversation about Islamic terrorism and national security, topics that resonate deeply with his fan base.

During the interview, Simmons advocated for increased profiling as a necessary measure during wartime. He expressed a willingness to be subjected to profiling himself, stating, ""I want you to stop me first."" This bold assertion highlights his belief that such measures are essential for national safety, even if they come with the risk of being perceived as unfair.

When pressed about the potential for profiling to be unjust, Simmons acknowledged the inherent unfairness, remarking, ""It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist."" His candidness reflects a no-nonsense approach to a complex issue, one that has garnered both support and criticism from various quarters.

The article humorously speculated on the possibility of Simmons taking on a more official role in national security, suggesting he could become the director of Homeland Security under a hypothetical Trump presidency. While this notion is presented in jest, it underscores the blending of celebrity culture with political discourse in contemporary society.

It is important to note that the views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com.

Real_48-Webpage,"Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'","(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""

""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""

Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.

Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.

Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.

""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""

""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""

""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""

Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016

In response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.

Danny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.",http://cnn.it/2cQyS4N,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,"Dan Merica,Eugene Scott",http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161118161709-cop-punches-woman-in-face-thumb-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718110446-02-officer-mohamed-noor-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717224427-justine-ruszczyk-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170711043320-georgia-police-beating-jnd-orig-vstop-00000612-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170104090632-north-carolina-school-body-slam-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170720014308-baltimore-pd-body-cam-video-release-02-large-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170626185531-jordan-edwards-roy-oliver-split-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712182221-florida-state-attorney-aramis-ayala-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170818111936-dashcam-video-ohio-violent-arrest-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160707080401-philando-castile-facebook-2-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520225617-georgia-man-tased-death-police-pkg-00012201-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717113139-australian-woman-minneapolis-police-shooting-nr-00000812-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718090944-betsy-hodges-7-18-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712054244-louisiana-couple-police-shooting-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160428084627-baltimore-teen-replica-gun-shot-dnt-00001823-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html,"{""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""author"": ""Eugene Scott and Dan Merica, CNN"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-col,col-controversial-police-incidents-"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Election 2016, US election, Tulsa, shooting, politics, Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable' - CNNPolitics"", ""article"": {""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202""}, ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-21T14:20:33Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced plans to prevent police-involved shootings.

In a bold move aimed at addressing the ongoing crisis of police-involved shootings, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced a comprehensive strategy designed to prevent such incidents and foster better relationships between law enforcement and minority communities. This initiative comes in the wake of several high-profile shootings that have ignited national outrage and calls for reform.

Mook outlined two primary components of Clinton's approach. The first involves establishing national standards for managing police situations, which aims to improve training protocols for law enforcement officers. By implementing these standards, the campaign hopes to reduce the likelihood of tragic incidents that have claimed the lives of unarmed individuals, particularly within minority communities.

The second component focuses on enhancing relationships between police and minority communities through community policing initiatives and increased investment in resources. This strategy seeks to build trust and cooperation between law enforcement and the communities they serve, ultimately leading to safer environments for all citizens.

Clinton's commitment to addressing systemic issues within the criminal justice system was further underscored by her condemnation of ""systematic racism"" following the shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation and has become a rallying point for activists advocating for police reform.

In addition to the Crutcher shooting, protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina, following the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. These protests turned violent, resulting in injuries to approximately 12 police officers. The unrest highlighted the deep-seated tensions between law enforcement and communities of color, further emphasizing the urgent need for reform.

Clinton has called for a national conversation about implicit bias and the unequal treatment that many individuals face within the criminal justice system. She recognizes that while there are many dedicated and good police officers, systemic change is necessary to address the root causes of these issues. Clinton described the current situation as ""unbearable,"" insisting that it must be deemed ""intolerable"" by society.

In a show of solidarity and urgency, Clinton took to social media to express her outrage over the Crutcher shooting. She tweeted about the incident, emphasizing the need for immediate action to prevent further tragedies. Her statements resonate with a growing chorus of voices demanding accountability and reform within law enforcement agencies across the nation.

As investigations into the Crutcher shooting are underway, both the Department of Justice and state authorities are examining potential civil rights violations. The outcome of these investigations could have significant implications for the future of policing in America and the ongoing dialogue surrounding race and justice.

Clinton's campaign is positioning itself as a leader in the fight against police violence and systemic racism, aiming to create a safer and more equitable society for all citizens. By advocating for national standards and community engagement, Clinton hopes to address the underlying issues that contribute to police-involved shootings and foster a more just criminal justice system.

The announcement of these plans comes at a critical time in American society, as communities grapple with the aftermath of violence and the urgent need for reform. Clinton's approach seeks to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the communities they serve, promoting understanding and cooperation in the face of adversity.

As the nation continues to confront these pressing issues, Clinton's campaign is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the conversation around police reform and racial justice. With a focus on systemic change and community engagement, the campaign aims to create a future where all individuals can feel safe and protected, regardless of their background.

In conclusion, the announcement by Robby Mook marks a significant step in addressing the complex challenges surrounding police-involved shootings and systemic racism. Clinton's commitment to establishing national standards and fostering community relationships reflects a broader movement towards accountability and reform in the criminal justice system. As investigations into recent shootings unfold, the call for action has never been more urgent.",-5.0,-17.0,656.0,-0.14705882352941177,-0.007621951219512195,734.0,-0.5862068965517241,-0.02316076294277929
Real_49-Webpage,Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked,"Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked

Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager.

Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative.

Story Continued Below

“He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?”

Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.

Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.”

“So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked.

“You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.

In the lead-up to the highly anticipated debate against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has confirmed that Trump is prepared to explain his plan to combat the Islamic State, should the topic arise. While Trump has previously made broad statements about ""knocking the hell out of ISIS,"" Conway emphasized that there is a more specific strategy in place.

Conway stated that Trump will share details of his approach to defeating ISIS if prompted during the debate. However, she also criticized Clinton for publicly posting her own plan to tackle the terrorist organization on her campaign website, suggesting that such transparency could be detrimental.

The Trump campaign has been careful to maintain a level of vagueness regarding the specifics of their strategy, a tactic aimed at preventing ISIS from gaining insight into their plans. Conway reiterated that while voters have a right to know about Trump’s intentions, he will not disclose any specifics that could potentially benefit the enemy.

During the debate, Conway assured that Trump will articulate his perspective on defeating ISIS, but will refrain from revealing exact strategies that could compromise national security. This approach reflects a broader campaign strategy that seeks to balance transparency with the need for operational security in the fight against terrorism.

As the debate approaches, all eyes will be on Trump to see how he navigates the discussion around ISIS and whether he will provide voters with a clearer picture of his plans while maintaining the necessary discretion. The outcome of this exchange could significantly influence public perception of Trump's readiness to handle national security issues.",-11.0,-5.0,331.0,-1.1,-0.03323262839879154,309.0,-0.5,-0.016181229773462782

Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists.

During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear.

""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.""

""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens.

In a poignant address during his final United Nations General Assembly meeting in Manhattan, President Obama reaffirmed the United States' commitment to combating ISIS and other terrorist threats. His remarks came in the wake of recent attempts at mass violence that have left many Americans feeling anxious and fearful.

Addressing the nation, Obama acknowledged the pervasive fears that have emerged following these violent incidents. He emphasized that succumbing to fear only serves to benefit terrorists, who thrive on creating a climate of fear and disruption. ""We must resist the urge to yield to fear,"" he stated, highlighting the resilience of the people of New York and New Jersey in the face of adversity.

The President praised the swift and effective response of law enforcement in New York and New Jersey, particularly in relation to the dual bomb attacks that had recently occurred. He expressed pride in the toughness and resoluteness of local residents, who have shown remarkable strength during these challenging times.

Obama pointed out that the ultimate goal of terrorists is to instill fear and disrupt the daily lives of Americans, thereby undermining the very values that the nation stands for. He reiterated the importance of unity and resilience in overcoming these challenges, urging citizens to remain steadfast in their commitment to safety and community.

As investigations continue in Chelsea following a bomb explosion that injured dozens, Obama's message resonates with many who are grappling with the implications of such violence. His call to action serves as a reminder that, despite the threats posed by terrorism, the spirit of resilience and determination remains a cornerstone of American identity.",-6.0,-13.0,331.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.01812688821752266,311.0,-1.0833333333333333,-0.04180064308681672
Real_50-Webpage,Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity,"United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.

The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.

At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.

""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.

Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""

JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45

""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.

""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""

The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.

A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.

Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.

""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""

Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.

""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.

""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.

The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.

""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement.

But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.

""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.""

The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.

The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.

""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""

Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.

""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.""

But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.

""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""

As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.

The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.

Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.

And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp.

""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said.",http://cnn.it/2deTou2,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg,Laura Koran,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920104405-02-obama-un-0920-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920152131-obama-united-nations-general-assembly-origwx-bw-00000210-exlarge-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920093742-obama-leaders-collage-edited-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html,"{""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""author"": ""Laura Koran"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,art-vid"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""politics, Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity - CNNPolitics"", ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-20T22:23:38Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- President Obama urged countries to address the global refugee crisis during a speech at the United Nations.

In a powerful address at the United Nations, President Barack Obama urged nations around the world to confront the escalating global refugee crisis, emphasizing the moral obligation to assist the tens of millions of displaced individuals. His remarks came during a pivotal moment as he convened a Leaders' Summit on Refugees, aimed at highlighting the urgency of the situation and galvanizing international support.

The refugee crisis has reached alarming proportions, with a staggering 65.3 million people displaced by conflict or persecution as of 2015, according to a UN study. Among these, 21.3 million are classified as refugees, a figure that underscores the pressing need for collective action. Obama pointed to the Syrian refugee situation, where 4.8 million individuals have been forced to flee their homes, labeling it as ""unacceptable."" This crisis, he argued, is not just a humanitarian issue but a test of humanity itself.

In his speech, Obama drew historical parallels, cautioning that failure to act decisively could lead to harsh judgment by future generations. He articulated a vision of a world where nations come together to provide refuge and support to those in need, rather than turning inward and erecting barriers. Critically, he addressed the political climate in the United States, specifically opposing the notion of building a wall along the US-Mexico border. This sentiment resonated with many who believe that compassion and solidarity should guide responses to the refugee crisis.

The Leaders' Summit on Refugees was designed to be a platform for world leaders to commit to increasing funding, resettlement opportunities, and access to education and work for refugees. While the summit aimed to foster a spirit of cooperation and shared responsibility, aid groups expressed skepticism regarding its potential for concrete action. Many advocates for refugees worry that the summit's outcomes may not translate into the necessary support and resources needed to address the crisis effectively.

In a significant move, the Obama administration announced plans to increase the U.S. refugee intake from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 in 2017. This decision reflects a commitment to play a more substantial role in alleviating the suffering of displaced individuals. However, the administration faces considerable challenges in garnering Congressional support for refugee assistance, as political divisions continue to complicate the discourse surrounding immigration and refugee policies.

The refugee crisis is not confined to any one region; it is a global issue that affects millions across various continents. Developing countries in the ""global south"" are shouldering a disproportionate burden, hosting a significant number of refugees. Protracted conflicts, such as those in South Sudan and Somalia, have resulted in generations of individuals living as lifelong refugees, further complicating the humanitarian landscape.

As the summit unfolded, co-hosts reported significant humanitarian contributions from world leaders, showcasing a collective commitment to addressing the refugee crisis. However, the true measure of success will depend on the implementation of these commitments and the tangible support provided to those in need.

Obama's call to action resonates deeply in a world grappling with the consequences of conflict, persecution, and displacement. The refugee crisis is not merely a statistic; it represents the lives of millions who have been uprooted from their homes and communities. As nations reflect on their responsibilities, the hope is that they will rise to the occasion, demonstrating compassion and solidarity in the face of one of the most pressing humanitarian challenges of our time.

In conclusion, President Obama's address at the United Nations serves as a clarion call for global action on the refugee crisis. It is a reminder that the plight of refugees is a shared responsibility, one that requires collective action and unwavering commitment from the international community. As the world watches, the challenge remains: will nations heed this call and take meaningful steps to support those who have been displaced? The answer to this question will shape the future of millions and define our collective humanity.",-13.0,1.0,1293.0,-0.325,-0.010054137664346482,734.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0013623978201634877
Real_51-Webpage,Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings,"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues

It's a recurring theme of his campaign

Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions.

The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law.

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.

""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

Trump's remarks focused on his hardline immigration policies, emphasizing the need for a robust response to domestic terror threats.

He referenced her controversial statement labeling his supporters as being in a ""basket of deplorables,"" questioning why she has not applied similar scrutiny to radical Islam.

Real_52-Webpage,In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism,"Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.

The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.

But the ""he said/she said"" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics.

Story Continued Below

While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?

In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.

Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.

But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.

As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both ""he said and she said""—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.

One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?

I don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.

The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.

Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.

Obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.

The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.”

Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.

The last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”

If you’re not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.

In the ever-evolving landscape of political journalism, the ""he said/she said"" method has come under intense scrutiny, particularly since 2009 when NYU professor Jay Rosen began vocalizing his concerns. This approach, characterized by presenting opposing viewpoints without editorializing, has been a staple of journalistic practice for decades. However, as political discourse has become increasingly polarized, the effectiveness and integrity of this method have been called into question.

The debate surrounding this journalistic style gained significant traction when the New York Times published a piece that labeled then-President Donald Trump a liar. This article, which did not afford Trump the opportunity to respond, ignited discussions about the responsibilities of journalists in the face of blatant dishonesty from public figures. Critics of the ""he said/she said"" approach argue that it can perpetuate falsehoods by treating lies and truths as equally valid, thereby misleading the public.

Proponents of abandoning this method contend that it can lead to a more honest portrayal of politicians, particularly those like Trump, who have been known to frequently misrepresent facts. They argue that the traditional model fails to hold such figures accountable for their statements, allowing them to escape scrutiny. However, the author of this analysis acknowledges the reality of Trump's dishonesty while cautioning against a wholesale rejection of the ""he said/she said"" framework. 

The concern is that moving away from this model could undermine the very foundation of political journalism. The ""he said/she said"" structure encourages due diligence, compelling journalists to seek out multiple perspectives before drawing conclusions. This practice not only fosters a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues but also provides a platform for minority viewpoints, which can be essential for a balanced inquiry.

Historical examples abound that illustrate the importance of dissenting voices in shaping scientific and cultural paradigms. The scientific method itself is predicated on the idea of testing hypotheses through rigorous debate and scrutiny. When dissenting opinions are silenced or ignored, the potential for significant shifts in understanding is stifled. This principle extends beyond science into the realm of journalism, where the inclusion of diverse perspectives can lead to a more nuanced and informed public discourse.

Moreover, the ""he said/she said"" model serves as a safeguard against confirmation bias, the tendency for individuals to favor information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs. By presenting multiple viewpoints, this journalistic approach encourages readers to engage with ideas that challenge their perspectives, ultimately promoting a more informed citizenry. In an age where echo chambers are prevalent, the value of this method cannot be overstated.

The conclusion drawn from this analysis is that while the ""he said/she said"" method may appear to benefit dishonest figures like Trump, it ultimately serves a greater purpose in maintaining the integrity of journalism. By adhering to this framework, journalists can uphold their responsibility to provide a balanced account of events, ensuring that all voices are heard and that the public is equipped to make informed decisions.

In summary, the debate over the ""he said/she said"" journalism method is far from settled. While the challenges posed by political figures who frequently distort the truth are significant, the potential consequences of abandoning this approach could be even more detrimental. As the landscape of political journalism continues to evolve, it is crucial to recognize the value of diverse perspectives and the role they play in fostering a well-informed public. The commitment to due diligence and balanced inquiry remains a cornerstone of responsible journalism, one that should not be easily discarded in the face of adversity.",6.0,22.0,2265.0,0.06593406593406594,0.0026490066225165563,670.0,0.88,0.03283582089552239
Real_53-Webpage,Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. […] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”

Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has become a polarizing figure, frequently appearing on Fox News to voice his criticisms of the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has controversially likened to international terrorists. Clarke, a staunch supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, garnered national attention when he spoke in favor of Trump at the Republican National Convention, further solidifying his alignment with the GOP.

However, Clarke's media presence has been overshadowed by the tragic death of Terrill Thomas, a 38-year-old man who died in the Milwaukee County Jail on April 24, 2016. Thomas's death, which occurred nine days after his arrest related to a shooting, has raised serious concerns about the conditions within the jail. Inmates reported that Thomas begged for water before his death, and the Milwaukee County medical examiner later ruled his death a homicide due to profound dehydration, attributing it to the actions of another person.

Reports from inmates indicate that Thomas's water supply was cut off for six days, a situation that was alarming enough for one inmate to warn jailers about the potential risk to Thomas's life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt, who has been involved in the case, received calls from other inmates who reported similar issues regarding access to water. Heipt noted that another inmate had died under comparable circumstances in 2011, raising questions about the jail's treatment of inmates and the systemic issues that may exist.

As Clarke continues to engage in a pro-Trump bus tour organized by a supporting super PAC, the juxtaposition of his political activities with the serious allegations surrounding the jail's conditions has drawn criticism. In 2015, Clarke reportedly earned over $150,000 from speaking fees, travel reimbursements, and gifts, further highlighting the financial incentives tied to his public persona.

The combination of Clarke's outspoken media presence and the tragic circumstances surrounding Thomas's death has sparked a broader conversation about accountability and the treatment of individuals within the criminal justice system in Milwaukee. As the community grapples with these issues, Clarke's role as sheriff remains under intense scrutiny.",-25.0,-30.0,375.0,-1.9230769230769231,-0.06666666666666667,403.0,-2.5,-0.07444168734491315

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?”

In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

“I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

In a recent interview, Janet Brown, the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), stirred the political landscape by asserting that fact-checking should not be a component of presidential debates. This statement has ignited a heated discussion about the role of moderators and the integrity of the debate process itself.

Brown's comments raised significant questions about the nature of facts in political discourse. She expressed uncertainty about how to differentiate between ""big facts"" and ""little facts,"" which complicates the role of moderators who are tasked with overseeing the debates. This ambiguity has led to concerns about the effectiveness of moderators in addressing misinformation during these high-stakes events.

The Trump campaign has welcomed Brown's remarks, interpreting them as a potential advantage for their candidate. Supporters of former President Donald Trump believe that the absence of fact-checking will allow him to navigate the debates without the risk of being called out for his frequent misstatements. This sentiment reflects a broader strategy that the Trump campaign has employed throughout his political career, where the focus often shifts away from factual accuracy to a more emotive and assertive style of communication.

Analysis of Trump's statements during his campaign trail reveals a troubling pattern. Reports indicate that he lies approximately once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds, a statistic that underscores the frequency of his misrepresentations. These false claims span a range of topics, including the Iraq war, health care policies, and crime rates, among others. Such a high rate of misinformation raises critical questions about the responsibility of candidates to provide truthful information to the electorate.

Comparative analyses of fact-checking efforts have shown that Trump's lies significantly exceed those of his political opponents, including Hillary Clinton. This disparity has prompted journalists and political analysts to scrutinize the implications of excluding fact-checking from debates. Many have criticized the decision, arguing that it undermines the purpose of moderators, who are expected to facilitate informed discussions and correct misinformation when necessary.

The lack of fact-checking has been met with enthusiasm from Trump supporters, who view it as a boon for their candidate's chances of success in the debates. This perspective highlights a growing divide in the political landscape, where the acceptance of misinformation can be seen as a strategic advantage rather than a detriment to democratic discourse.

The implications of Brown's stance on fact-checking extend beyond the immediate context of the debates. If a political party's primary argument is to allow a candidate to lie without consequence, it raises fundamental questions about the values and principles that underpin that party's identity. The suggestion that voters may need to reconsider their party affiliation if they support a candidate who prioritizes deception over truth is a provocative one, challenging the very foundation of political loyalty.

As the debate season approaches, the absence of fact-checking will likely continue to be a contentious issue. The role of moderators, the responsibility of candidates to provide accurate information, and the expectations of the electorate are all at stake. The decision to exclude fact-checking may ultimately shape the narrative of the debates and influence voter perceptions in significant ways.

In conclusion, Janet Brown's assertion that fact-checking should not be part of presidential debates has sparked a critical dialogue about the integrity of political discourse. As candidates prepare to face off in the upcoming debates, the implications of this decision will resonate throughout the political landscape, prompting voters to reflect on the importance of truth in their electoral choices. The ongoing conversation about the role of fact-checking in politics underscores the necessity for transparency and accountability in the democratic process, as the electorate seeks to navigate an increasingly complex and often misleading political environment.",11.0,0.0,839.0,0.3235294117647059,0.013110846245530394,693.0,0.0,0.0

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.

“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.

“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

In the aftermath of the highly anticipated debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, a prominent political strategist and former campaign manager for Trump, has come forward to commend the former president for his measured approach during the event. Conway's remarks highlight Trump's decision to maintain composure in the face of personal attacks, particularly those concerning his past comments about women.

During the debate, Clinton aimed to leverage Trump's controversial remarks to undermine his candidacy. However, Conway noted that Trump chose not to retaliate against these attacks, a decision she praised as a demonstration of restraint. ""It was a significant moment when he decided not to engage in a back-and-forth that could have escalated tensions,"" Conway stated, emphasizing the importance of maintaining decorum in a high-stakes political environment.

Conway further elaborated on Trump's choice to avoid making any harsh comments, particularly in light of Clinton's family being present in the audience. This decision, according to Conway, showcased Trump's ability to prioritize the atmosphere of the debate over personal grievances. ""He recognized the importance of the moment and chose to rise above the fray,"" she remarked.

After the debate concluded, Trump himself acknowledged that he had contemplated delivering a strong response to Clinton's attacks but ultimately decided against it. This admission aligns with Conway's assessment of the debate, where she suggested that Trump had the opportunity to address Bill Clinton's controversial record with women but opted to refrain from doing so. ""He had a chance to pivot and make a point about the past, but he chose to focus on the present,"" Conway explained.

In her critique of Clinton's performance, Conway expressed disappointment, asserting that the former Secretary of State failed to deliver a significant ""knockout punch"" against Trump. She characterized Clinton's approach as overly rehearsed, suggesting that it detracted from her ability to connect with the audience. ""It felt like she was more focused on her talking points than on engaging in a genuine dialogue,"" Conway noted.

Moreover, Conway questioned the overall effectiveness of Clinton's performance, particularly in terms of presenting a compelling vision for economic growth. ""Voters are looking for solutions and a clear path forward, and I didn't see that from her,"" she stated. Conway's comments reflect a broader sentiment among some political analysts who believe that Clinton missed an opportunity to articulate a strong economic message that could resonate with undecided voters.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Conway's insights into the debate provide a glimpse into the strategies and perceptions that shape the narratives surrounding both candidates. Her praise for Trump's restraint juxtaposed with her criticism of Clinton's performance underscores the complexities of modern political discourse, where every word and gesture can have significant implications.

In conclusion, Kellyanne Conway's reflections on the debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton highlight the contrasting approaches of the two candidates. While Trump demonstrated restraint in the face of personal attacks, Clinton's performance has been scrutinized for its lack of spontaneity and compelling vision. As the election cycle progresses, the implications of this debate will likely continue to influence voter perceptions and campaign strategies.",5.0,20.0,650.0,0.35714285714285715,0.007692307692307693,615.0,0.9090909090909091,0.032520325203252036

Plastic glasses, knives, forks and food boxes are being been banned in France. (Bertrand Combaldieu/Associated Press)

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

[A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,,https://www.washingtonpost.com,{'$date': 1474243200000},,"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg&w=60,https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,"{""theme"": ""normal"", ""news_keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Washington Post"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste."", ""title"": ""France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery"", ""url"": ""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""image"": ""https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""unsafe-url"", ""twitter"": {""site"": ""@WashingtonPost"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""creator"": ""jameskmcauley""}, ""object-hash"": 1503984085, ""robots"": ""index,follow"", ""apple-itunes-app"": ""app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 500835072, ""app_id"": 41245586762}, ""keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste.""}","- France has become the first country to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils, effective in 2020.

In a groundbreaking move towards environmental sustainability, France has officially become the first country to implement a ban on plastic plates, cups, and utensils, effective from 2020. This significant legislation is part of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, which aims to reshape the country’s approach to waste management and promote a more sustainable future.

The ban, which also includes the prohibition of plastic bags in grocery stores starting in July, is designed to foster a ""circular economy"" of waste disposal. This concept emphasizes the importance of product design and recycling, encouraging manufacturers to create items that can be reused or repurposed rather than discarded. The French government is taking a firm stance against plastic, which is notorious for its inability to biodegrade. Instead, plastic breaks down into harmful microplastics that pose serious risks to wildlife and ecosystems.

The environmental implications of plastic production are staggering. Each year, the industry consumes millions of barrels of oil, contributing significantly to climate change. By banning single-use plastics, France aims to reduce its carbon footprint and promote renewable energy sources. French President François Hollande has expressed strong support for the ban, viewing it as a crucial step in the broader initiative to lower greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

However, the ban has not been without controversy. The Socialist government faces opposition from some factions in Brussels, who argue that the legislation infringes upon EU laws regarding the free movement of goods. Eamonn Bates, a representative from Pack2Go Europe, has announced plans to challenge the ban, urging the European Commission to take legal action against France. Bates argues that the ban could disrupt trade and create an uneven playing field for businesses operating within the EU.

Despite the pushback, the French government remains steadfast in its commitment to environmental reform. The introduction of the ban was initially proposed for 2017 but faced delays due to concerns about its potential impact on low-income families. The government has since worked to address these issues, allowing exceptions for items made from compostable and biosourced materials, ensuring that the needs of all citizens are considered.

The move to ban plastic utensils and containers is part of a larger global trend towards reducing plastic waste. Many countries are grappling with the environmental consequences of plastic pollution, and France's decisive action sets a precedent for others to follow. As the world continues to confront the challenges posed by climate change and environmental degradation, France's ban on single-use plastics may serve as a model for future legislation aimed at protecting the planet.

In conclusion, France's pioneering ban on plastic plates, cups, and utensils marks a significant milestone in the fight against plastic pollution. With strong governmental support and a focus on promoting a circular economy, the country is taking bold steps towards a more sustainable future. As the debate continues over the implications of the ban, it remains to be seen how this legislation will influence environmental policies both within the EU and around the world.",-14.0,-12.0,529.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.026465028355387523,571.0,-0.5217391304347826,-0.021015761821366025
Real_57-Webpage,Paul Ryan ducks on stop-and-frisk,"Story highlights Ryan called for calm in Charlotte, but would not comment on Trump's ""stop and frisk"" proposals

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump.

""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,"" Ryan said.

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.

But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.

What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.

The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said.

As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first?

Charlotte, North Carolina, has been engulfed in unrest following the shooting of a black man by local police, igniting speculation and anger within the community. The incident has led to widespread riots, characterized by looting and theft, and has resulted in the shutdown of major thoroughfares, including I-85. 

The victim, identified as 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, has been portrayed in the media as an innocent individual engaged in charitable activities. This narrative has fueled public outrage and protests, as many community members express their grief and anger over the shooting. However, the situation has raised critical questions about the police's perspective and the broader implications of the incident amidst the ongoing unrest.

In a news conference addressing the incident, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney provided details surrounding the events leading up to the shooting. According to Chief Putney, officers were actively searching for a suspect when they observed Scott exiting a vehicle while armed with a handgun. The police instructed Scott to drop the weapon, but he exited the vehicle a second time still holding the gun, which Chief Putney stated posed a significant threat to the officers on the scene.

The police chief emphasized the need for a shift in the narrative surrounding the incident, suggesting that the portrayal of events on social media has been misrepresented. He urged the community to consider the facts of the situation, which he believes have been overshadowed by emotional responses and misinformation.

The unrest in Charlotte has drawn attention to the ongoing tensions between law enforcement and communities of color, with many progressives criticizing police actions without firsthand experience in law enforcement. This critique has sparked a debate about the role of police in society and the complexities of policing in high-stress situations.

As the riots continue, the community remains divided. Some residents express solidarity with the police, arguing that officers must make split-second decisions in dangerous situations, while others demand accountability and transparency from law enforcement. The contrasting narratives surrounding Scott's actions and the police response have only intensified the calls for justice and reform.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a microcosm of the broader national conversation about race, policing, and community relations. As protests continue and the community grapples with the aftermath of the shooting, the need for dialogue and understanding between law enforcement and residents has never been more critical.

In the wake of the riots, local leaders are calling for calm and urging community members to engage in constructive conversations about the issues at hand. The hope is that through dialogue, the community can begin to heal and address the underlying tensions that have been exacerbated by this tragic incident.

As the investigation into the shooting unfolds, the focus remains on the need for transparency and accountability from law enforcement, as well as the importance of understanding the complexities of policing in a diverse society. The events in Charlotte highlight the urgent need for change and the necessity of fostering trust between police and the communities they serve.",-23.0,-29.0,562.0,-0.9583333333333334,-0.04092526690391459,565.0,-1.380952380952381,-0.05132743362831858

ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June.

The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

""The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,"" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. ""As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.""

Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.

Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.

Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.

Real_6-Webpage,Obama weighs in on the debate,"Obama weighs in on the debate

President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change.

The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.”

And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.”

The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both.

""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012

""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,"" Obama said, ""that worries me.""

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is ""naturally occurring.""

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, former President Barack Obama has reiterated his critical stance on Donald Trump, emphasizing concerns about the Republican candidate's preparedness and temperament for the highest office in the land. Obama articulated his belief that Trump is ill-equipped to handle the serious challenges facing the nation, particularly in areas such as nuclear weapons and climate change.

During an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Obama took the opportunity to commend Hillary Clinton's performance in the debate, highlighting her qualifications and readiness to lead. In stark contrast, he criticized Trump for what he perceives as a lack of core values, particularly regarding inclusion and the opportunity for all Americans. Obama’s remarks reflect a broader concern about the implications of Trump’s leadership style and policy positions.

One of Obama’s primary worries centers around nuclear proliferation and the potential for future generations to inherit a world fraught with danger. He specifically pointed to Trump’s comments suggesting that Japan and South Korea might consider developing their own nuclear arsenals as particularly alarming. This notion raises significant questions about the stability of international relations and the potential for escalating tensions in an already volatile region.

Additionally, Obama referenced a tweet from Trump dating back to 2012, in which the then-businessman claimed that climate change was a hoax created by China. This statement has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocates and scientists alike. Obama underscored the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change, noting that 99% of scientists advocate for immediate action to address the crisis. He expressed deep concern that Trump’s dismissive attitude toward climate science could have dire consequences for the planet.

In response to Obama’s critiques, Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, stated that Trump believes climate change is ""naturally occurring."" This assertion has sparked further debate about the candidate's understanding of environmental issues and the policies he would pursue if elected.

As the election approaches, Obama’s comments serve as a reminder of the stark differences in approach and philosophy between the candidates. With pressing global issues at stake, the former president’s insights highlight the importance of leadership that is both informed and responsible. As voters prepare to make their choice, the implications of these debates will undoubtedly resonate in the coming weeks.",-7.0,-6.0,419.0,-0.5833333333333334,-0.016706443914081145,443.0,-0.35294117647058826,-0.013544018058690745
Real_60-Webpage,How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying “yes” to Fox News almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning, he is booked on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn’t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

In a notable shift from his previous approach, Donald Trump has recently retreated from broader media engagement, opting to primarily communicate with Fox News. Known for his openness to interview requests, this change in strategy raises questions about its implications for his political candidacy as he gears up for the 2024 election.

Historically, Trump has been accessible to various media outlets, which has aided his political rise. However, his current focus on Fox News marks a significant departure from this trend. While he frequently accepts interview requests from the network, he has been declining opportunities with most other major news organizations. This selective engagement appears to be a calculated move aimed at energizing his base rather than reaching out to undecided voters.

Critics of Trump's strategy argue that this ""Fox News cocoon"" could limit his appeal to a broader audience, which is essential for winning elections. By primarily engaging with a single network, Trump minimizes exposure to challenging questions that could potentially undermine his narrative. Journalists have expressed frustration over this approach, noting that at Fox News, Trump often sidesteps tough follow-up questions on controversial topics, allowing him to maintain a favorable image among his supporters.

This strategy stands in stark contrast to the approaches taken by successful politicians like George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who actively engaged with swing districts and a variety of media outlets. Their willingness to face a diverse range of questions and audiences helped them connect with undecided voters, a crucial demographic in any election.

The implications of Trump's media strategy are reminiscent of the 2012 election, where many Fox News viewers were reportedly surprised by the outcome. This historical reference suggests that a similar miscalculation could occur if Trump continues to limit his media interactions. By not addressing a wider audience, he risks alienating potential voters who may be critical to his success in the upcoming election.

As the 2024 campaign unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Trump's focused engagement with Fox News will serve as a strength or a liability. While it may energize his core supporters, the question looms: can a candidate thrive in a political landscape that demands broader appeal? The answer may ultimately determine the trajectory of Trump's campaign and his chances of reclaiming the presidency.",-1.0,18.0,421.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.0023752969121140144,435.0,1.0588235294117647,0.041379310344827586
Real_61-Webpage,“Why Aren’t I 50 Points Ahead?” – Eagle Rising,"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again.

Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.

But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.”

For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.

Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump?

At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question:

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

As the 2016 presidential election draws near, the atmosphere surrounding Hillary Clinton's campaign has shifted dramatically. Initially, many liberals believed that Clinton's victory was assured, viewing the campaign as a mere formality. However, recent developments have forced a reevaluation of this perspective.

Clinton's campaign strategy has been characterized by minimal interaction with the press, a decision that has inadvertently allowed her opponent, Donald Trump, to dominate media attention. This approach has come under scrutiny as the election landscape becomes increasingly competitive. Following the Democratic National Convention (DNC), it became clear that Trump was not the underestimated candidate many had presumed him to be.

Compounding the challenges for Clinton, reports of her health issues have sparked discussions among Democrats about a potential ""Plan B."" These concerns have added to the urgency of the campaign as recent polls indicate that Trump is leading in several key battleground states, raising alarms within Clinton's camp.

During a campaign event in Las Vegas, Clinton expressed her frustration, questioning why she wasn't ""50 points ahead"" of Trump, given the circumstances. This sentiment reflects a growing anxiety among her supporters as they grapple with the reality of a tight race. Clinton emphasized the importance of getting Trump's record out to voters, urging her supporters to take action and ""stage an intervention"" for those who support Trump.

Clinton remains steadfast in her belief that the facts favor her record over Trump's. She has called on her supporters to engage in conversations with undecided voters and those leaning towards Trump, encouraging them to persuade others against casting their ballots for the Republican candidate. The urgency of her message underscores the shifting dynamics of the race and the need for a robust ground game as the election date approaches.

As the campaign continues, Clinton's team faces the dual challenge of addressing internal concerns while countering Trump's momentum. With the election just around the corner, the stakes have never been higher, and both candidates are poised to fight for every vote in what promises to be a fiercely contested battle.",11.0,11.0,413.0,0.6875,0.026634382566585957,402.0,0.6875,0.02736318407960199

Over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, Bobby Knight said Wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like Donald Trump.

""There’s nobody that I’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right,"" Knight told an audience in Toledo, Ohio, his home state. ""And I think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United States. And there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been Donald Trump.""

Story Continued Below

Back on the campaign trail with Trump after several months, Knight extolled the Republican nominee as ""not just an American; he’s a world figure.""

""He’s known all over the world. Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together,"" the coach continued. ""United States around the world. A lot of businesses. Created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world.""

And Trump, Knight later indicated, is the person for the White House.

""Believe me when I tell you, I think you’re all gonna agree on this: Our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the United States of America,"" Knight said. He noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, ""immigration problems and on and on.""

Remarking on his study of history, Knight said that he had come to the conclusion that ""when I need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man I want to choose and the first man I want to see.""

Knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't ""dress as well as politicians dress, but I want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, I wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""

""And I think that when you leave, I hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the United States,"" Knight said.

In a spirited address in Toledo, Ohio, legendary basketball coach Bobby Knight extolled the virtues of Donald Trump, particularly his adeptness at problem-solving. Knight, known for his fiery coaching style and candid opinions, took to the stage to share his thoughts on the former president's capabilities, emphasizing the critical need for a leader who can effectively tackle the pressing issues facing the nation.

During his speech, Knight praised Trump for his remarkable ability to correct mistakes, a quality he believes is essential for the next president of the United States. ""I've never met anyone with a better grasp of problem-solving than Donald Trump,"" Knight declared, underscoring his belief that the nation requires a leader who can navigate complex challenges with skill and decisiveness.

Knight's remarks came at a time when the country grapples with significant hurdles, including a soaring national debt and ongoing immigration issues. He articulated the importance of having a problem solver at the helm, someone who can not only identify issues but also implement effective solutions. ""The next president will face challenges that require a strong, capable leader,"" Knight stated, reinforcing his view that Trump is uniquely qualified for the role.

""We need someone who understands the global landscape and can foster economic growth not just here, but around the world,"" he said, positioning Trump as a candidate who embodies that vision.

Knight's endorsement of Trump is rooted in his extensive study of history, which he cited as a basis for his preference.

""I've looked at history, and I believe that problem solvers are what we need in times of crisis,"" Knight remarked, suggesting that Trump's approach aligns with the qualities necessary for effective leadership.

Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it. Although Islamic terrorism would seem to be the most likely explanation, there have been “mad bombers” who’ve done this sort of thing before (See Ted Kaczynski & George Metesky).

Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation.

That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.

ELIZABETH, NJ – Authorities are investigating the discovery of three pipe bombs and two smaller explosive devices found in a trash can near the New Jersey Transit (NJT) Station in Elizabeth. The alarming find was confirmed by Elizabeth Mayor, who stated that the FBI is currently on the scene, working to assess the situation and determine the origins of the devices.

The discovery comes in the wake of previous bomb incidents that have raised concerns along the Jersey Shore and in New York. Speculation is mounting that a small team or an individual may be behind these recent bombings, prompting law enforcement to explore various leads.

While the investigation is still in its early stages, Islamic terrorism is being considered a likely motive for the bombings. However, authorities are also referencing historical cases of ""mad bombers,"" suggesting that the motivations behind these devices could be complex and multifaceted. As of now, it remains unclear whether the intent behind the bombs was to instill terror among the public or to cause mass casualties.

In a related development, the FBI has arrested five individuals who may have connections to the ongoing investigation into the Chelsea bombing. However, it is important to note that none of these individuals have been formally charged at this time. The FBI's involvement underscores the seriousness of the situation and the urgency with which authorities are approaching the investigation.

As details continue to emerge, residents and commuters in Elizabeth are urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. The discovery of these devices has heightened security concerns in the area, and officials are working diligently to ensure the safety of the public.

The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are expected to provide further updates as they gather more information. The community is on alert as the FBI and local law enforcement agencies collaborate to uncover the truth behind these dangerous devices and the individuals responsible for their placement.",-14.0,-10.0,392.0,-0.9333333333333333,-0.03571428571428571,370.0,-0.7142857142857143,-0.02702702702702703

(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it.

Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video , plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself.

""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs.

Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump.

""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention.

Magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect

A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said.

""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening.

Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami.

""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer.""

The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.

Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

The defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, James Patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.

In a significant ruling, a federal magistrate has denied a request for the immediate arraignment of bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami on federal charges. U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein stated that Rahami does not need to appear in federal court until he is officially in federal custody. Currently, Rahami is being held by local officials in New Jersey, as confirmed by the magistrate.

During the proceedings, Judge Gorenstein emphasized that the federal government has not yet arrested Rahami, and there is no evidence to suggest that he is in federal custody. This assertion directly disputes claims made by the defense, which argued that federal law enforcement was detaining Rahami. Gorenstein highlighted the absence of evidence supporting the defense's position, reinforcing the notion that Rahami remains under local jurisdiction.

The magistrate also rejected the defense's argument that a federal court rule mandates a prompt arraignment, regardless of the suspect's state custody status. Gorenstein declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who is currently hospitalized in Newark, and stated that he cannot appoint defense providers for him at this time.

In a related development, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that Rahami will soon be brought to New York City to face federal charges. These federal charges are expected to take precedence over any state charges he may face. The timeline for this transfer has not been disclosed, but it marks a critical step in the legal proceedings against Rahami.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office refrained from commenting on the magistrate's decision, leaving many questions unanswered regarding the next steps in the case. Meanwhile, defense attorney James Patton did not respond to requests for comment on the ruling, leaving the defense's strategy and future actions unclear.

The case against Ahmad Rahami has garnered significant attention, particularly in light of the serious nature of the charges he faces. As the legal process unfolds, the implications of the magistrate's ruling will likely play a crucial role in determining how the case proceeds in both federal and state courts.

As the situation develops, observers will be closely monitoring the actions of federal authorities and the defense team, particularly in light of the upcoming arraignment in New York City. The legal landscape surrounding Rahami's case remains complex, with both state and federal jurisdictions involved, and the outcome of this case could have far-reaching consequences.

In summary, the denial of immediate arraignment by Judge Gorenstein underscores the procedural intricacies of the legal system as it navigates the intersection of state and federal law in high-profile cases such as that of Ahmad Rahami.",-25.0,-21.0,471.0,-1.5625,-0.05307855626326964,491.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04276985743380855
Real_66-Webpage,US: ISIS did not use mustard agent in base attack,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL — OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

Real_67-Webpage,"Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say","The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.

""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.

Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.

A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.

The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.

""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.

He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""

James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.

""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.

""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg,"More Meghan,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997,"{""fb_title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@mkeneally"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-19"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-19 18:04:32"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race""}","- Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have heightened interest in presidential candidates' national security policies.

Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, coupled with a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have intensified the focus on national security policies among presidential candidates. The violent incidents, which resulted in numerous injuries, have prompted responses from key figures in the race, notably Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, as they seek to address the growing concerns of voters.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has weighed in on the potential impact of these attacks on voter sentiment. He believes that such events significantly heighten fear among the electorate, which may lead to increased support for candidates perceived as strong on national security. This shift in perception is particularly noteworthy given the historical context in which Republicans have traditionally been viewed as the party of law enforcement and national security.

Before the recent attacks, three national polls indicated that Clinton held a lead over Trump in terms of public trust regarding handling terrorism. An ABC News/Washington Post poll revealed that 50% of all adults trusted Clinton more than Trump, who garnered 41%. Among likely voters, the margin narrowed slightly, with Clinton at 48% and Trump at 45%. Similarly, a CBS/New York Times poll found that 49% of respondents favored Clinton on issues of terrorism and national security, compared to 45% for Trump. The Quinnipiac poll echoed these sentiments, showing Clinton leading Trump 49% to 47% on the question of keeping the country safe from terrorism.

However, Cohen notes a potential shift in this dynamic. Concerns have emerged regarding Trump's understanding of national security issues, which may alter the traditional Republican advantage in this area. As a result, candidates are adjusting their campaign speeches to emphasize national security in light of the recent violent events.

Cohen also cautions that Trump's rhetoric, particularly his calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States, could inadvertently inspire further attacks. This perspective highlights the complex relationship between political discourse and public safety, suggesting that inflammatory statements may have unintended consequences.

Adding to the analysis, James Campbell, a political science professor, argues that terrorist events could ultimately benefit Trump while harming Clinton. He posits that such incidents may be perceived as failures of the current administration's foreign policy, potentially swaying voters toward Trump, who has positioned himself as a tough-on-terrorism candidate. Campbell further indicates that these events may lead to increased support for stricter immigration standards and heightened scrutiny of individuals with Muslim-sounding names, reflecting a broader societal response to fear and insecurity.

As the presidential race continues to unfold, the implications of these recent attacks on national security policies will likely remain a focal point for both candidates. With public sentiment shifting in response to fear and uncertainty, the candidates' ability to effectively communicate their strategies for ensuring safety and security will be crucial in the coming weeks.

In conclusion, the recent bombings and stabbing attack have not only raised concerns about national security but have also reshaped the political landscape as candidates navigate the complexities of voter sentiment. As Clinton and Trump respond to these events, their approaches to national security will be closely scrutinized, potentially influencing the outcome of the election. The interplay between fear, perception, and policy will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping the narrative of this presidential race.",6.0,1.0,604.0,0.3333333333333333,0.009933774834437087,635.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0015748031496062992

When is the first general election presidential debate?

The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.

Story Continued Below

What time is the debate and how long is it?

The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.

How can I watch the debate?

It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.

Who will participate in the debate?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.

Who will moderate the debate?

Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.

What is the format of the debate?

The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.

Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?

Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.

What's at stake for Hillary Clinton?

The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.

What's at stake for Donald Trump?

Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again.

What is the most watched debate in presidential history?

In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.

What's the most-watched television moment of all time?

Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.

Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.

The stage is set for the first general election presidential debate of 2016, scheduled for September 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. This highly anticipated event will feature former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump, marking a significant moment in the race for the White House. The debate is set to begin at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and will last for 90 minutes without any commercial interruptions, allowing for an uninterrupted exchange of ideas and policies.

The debate will be broadcast across major television networks and will also be available on the websites of prominent cable news channels and C-SPAN, ensuring that millions of viewers can tune in to witness the candidates' performances. As the first of three scheduled debates, this event is expected to play a crucial role in shaping public perception and influencing voter decisions as the election approaches.

Lester Holt, the anchor of ""NBC Nightly News,"" will serve as the moderator for the debate. This will be Holt's second time in this role during the 2016 presidential cycle, and his experience is anticipated to facilitate a fair and engaging discussion between the candidates. The debate format will consist of six segments, each lasting 15 minutes. Holt will kick off the debate with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to provide their initial response. Following these responses, there will be opportunities for rebuttal, allowing for a dynamic exchange of viewpoints.

Tentative topics for the debate include “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” However, these topics are subject to change based on current news developments, which could influence the direction of the conversation. The inclusion of pressing issues is expected to resonate with voters who are eager to hear the candidates' stances on matters that affect their daily lives.

Notably, Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, candidates from the Green Party and Libertarian Party respectively, were not invited to participate in the debate. Their exclusion is due to their failure to meet the 15 percent threshold in selected national polls, a criterion established to ensure that only candidates with significant public support are included in the debate.

For Hillary Clinton, this debate represents a critical opportunity to regain momentum in the race. After experiencing a dip in her polling lead against Trump, Clinton aims to leverage her extensive policy knowledge and debate experience to connect with voters and reinforce her qualifications for the presidency. Her supporters are hopeful that she will effectively articulate her vision for the country and address the concerns of the electorate.

On the other hand, Donald Trump enters the debate under a different set of expectations. While he faces scrutiny regarding his policy knowledge and self-restraint, he also benefits from relatively low expectations. This dynamic could work in his favor; if he demonstrates composure and articulates his positions effectively, he may surprise viewers and bolster his standing in the polls. Trump's unconventional approach to politics has captivated a significant portion of the electorate, and this debate could serve as a pivotal moment for him to solidify his support.

The stakes are high for both candidates, as debates have historically played a crucial role in shaping the outcome of presidential elections. The most-watched debate in U.S. history occurred in 1980, when 80.6 million viewers tuned in to watch then-President Jimmy Carter face off against Ronald Reagan. This record highlights the potential impact of the upcoming debate, as millions of Americans will be closely watching to gauge the candidates' performances.

While the debate is expected to attract a substantial audience, it is worth noting that the most-watched television moment in U.S. history remains Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, which drew in 114 million viewers. However, global events such as the moon landing and the royal wedding have captivated even larger audiences, underscoring the significance of televised events in shaping public discourse.

As the countdown to the debate continues, both Clinton and Trump are preparing for what promises to be a defining moment in the 2016 presidential campaign. With the election just weeks away, the candidates will be looking to make a lasting impression on voters and set the tone for the remainder of the campaign. The debate at Hofstra University is not just a contest of ideas; it is a critical juncture that could influence the trajectory of the election and the future of the nation.",14.0,49.0,780.0,0.3684210526315789,0.017948717948717947,828.0,1.6896551724137931,0.059178743961352656
Real_69-Webpage,U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court,"Under the Radar Blog Archives Select Date… July, 2017 June, 2017 May, 2017 April, 2017 March, 2017 February, 2017 January, 2017 December, 2016 November, 2016 October, 2016 September, 2016 August, 2016

Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday in Linden, N.J. | Nicolaus Czarnecki/Boston Herald via AP U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing.

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.

However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved.

""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""

The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.

Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.

While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.

The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.

Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect involved in a recent shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey, has been taken into custody. The incident, which unfolded in a dramatic confrontation, has led to a series of legal proceedings that are currently underway. Rahami is facing multiple charges, including five counts of attempted murder, stemming from the altercation with law enforcement.

Following his arrest, federal prosecutors have expressed their opposition to an immediate arraignment for Rahami on federal charges. This decision has raised questions about the timeline and nature of the legal proceedings he will face. In contrast, defense attorneys representing Rahami have requested a prompt court proceeding to ensure that he is informed of the charges against him and his rights. 

Despite the defense's request, prosecutors have clarified that Rahami is not currently in federal custody. Instead, he is facing state charges in New Jersey, which complicates the legal landscape surrounding his case. The state has set bail for Rahami at a staggering $5.2 million, reflecting the serious nature of the charges he faces.

As of now, Rahami is hospitalized in Newark, where he is receiving medical attention. A county court appearance has been scheduled for September 28, which will be a critical moment for both the prosecution and defense as they navigate the legal proceedings. However, there are concerns regarding Rahami's access to legal counsel. His defense team has claimed that he has been without legal representation since his arrest, raising questions about whether he was adequately advised of his Miranda rights during the initial stages of his detention.

Lawmakers have indicated that Rahami has not been cooperating with the ongoing investigation, which could further complicate the legal process. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has mentioned that Rahami would soon be taken to Manhattan, but federal prosecutors have shown no urgency in moving forward with the arraignment process. This lack of immediate action has left many observers wondering about the next steps in the case.

The Federal Defenders office in New York has sought to be appointed to represent Rahami, but prosecutors have deemed this request premature. This situation has created a legal limbo for Rahami, as he awaits further developments in his case. The federal magistrate judge, Gabriel Gorenstein, has not taken any immediate action regarding the arraignment request, leaving the timeline for Rahami's legal proceedings uncertain.

As the situation continues to evolve, the focus remains on the legal implications of Rahami's actions and the subsequent response from law enforcement and the judicial system. The upcoming court appearance on September 28 will be a pivotal moment, as it will provide clarity on the charges he faces and the legal representation he will receive moving forward.

In summary, Ahmad Khan Rahami's case is marked by a complex interplay of state and federal legal proceedings, with significant implications for his future. As he remains hospitalized and awaits his court appearance, the legal community and the public will be closely monitoring the developments in this high-profile case.",-21.0,-13.0,597.0,-1.05,-0.035175879396984924,567.0,-0.5652173913043478,-0.02292768959435626
Real_7-Webpage,Donald Trump's rise puts Ted Cruz in a bind,"Story highlights Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump earlier this year, but is under pressure to change his mind now

Cruz could face a primary challenge in 2018 from a fellow Republican

Washington (CNN) Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said.

JUST WATCHED Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife 01:51

On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them.""

Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

However, Cruz's supporters are advocating for him to maintain his position, emphasizing the importance of not alienating his own base. Steve Deace, a vocal Cruz backer, expressed that endorsing Trump would violate Cruz's personal rules for political endorsements, suggesting that such a move could compromise Cruz's integrity and principles.

As Trump’s poll numbers continue to rise, the pressure on Cruz intensifies. His lack of endorsement has raised concerns among Trump’s supporters, who fear that if Trump were to lose to Clinton by a narrow margin, Cruz could be blamed for not rallying behind the party's nominee.

The situation remains fluid as Cruz navigates the delicate balance between party loyalty and his own political convictions, with the implications of his decision likely to resonate well beyond the election. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Cruz will ultimately lend his support to Trump or stand firm in his initial refusal.",10.0,9.0,294.0,1.1111111111111112,0.034013605442176874,296.0,0.8181818181818182,0.030405405405405407

Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks.

The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe.

“Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.”

Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.”

“They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”

Real_71-Webpage,Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible',"Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.

Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.

Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""

On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""

""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.

A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.

""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.

Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.

Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.

This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.

Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.

Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.

Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.

On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.

Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""

Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.

""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.

Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.

Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.

All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.

On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.

""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.

A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.

Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""

Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.

Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.

Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.

In a federal court, explosive testimony has emerged regarding the controversial lane closures at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013, revealing a calculated plan by former Port Authority executives and staffers from then-Governor Chris Christie’s office to create traffic chaos as a means of political leverage. The testimony, delivered by David Wildstein, a former Port Authority director, has shed light on the motivations and actions that led to the infamous incident, which has since been a focal point of political scrutiny and legal battles.

Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and civil rights violations, took the stand to recount the events leading up to the lane closures. He revealed that Bridget Kelly, Christie’s ex-deputy chief of staff, expressed frustration over the lack of an endorsement from Fort Lee’s Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich. This frustration, according to Wildstein, prompted discussions about using the lane closures as a means to apply political pressure on Sokolich, a strategy that Kelly reportedly agreed to.

The testimony highlighted an email sent by Kelly on August 13, 2013, which indicated a plan for “traffic problems in Fort Lee.” Wildstein confirmed that this email was part of the broader scheme to create disruptions in the area. He emphasized that there was no advance notice given to Fort Lee officials or the public regarding the closures, a decision made to “maximize the impact” of the traffic chaos.

The timing of the lane closures was also a critical aspect of the plan. Wildstein testified that September 9 was specifically chosen to coincide with the start of the school year in Fort Lee, further exacerbating the potential for disruption. Initially, Wildstein had intended to close all three access lanes to the bridge but later decided to close only two after consulting with engineers.

On September 6, 2013, just days before the closures were set to begin, Wildstein informed Port Authority staff about the impending lane closures, instructing them to keep the information confidential. He misled staff into believing that the closures were part of a traffic study, a tactic that was part of the broader strategy to conceal the true intentions behind the actions.

As the closures commenced, Wildstein monitored the traffic buildup and communicated with Kelly, who expressed satisfaction with the results. The first day of the closures saw significant congestion, which was precisely the outcome that the orchestrators of the plan had hoped for. Meanwhile, Fort Lee officials, including Mayor Sokolich, attempted to reach out to Wildstein and another Port Authority official, Bill Baroni, but were met with what Wildstein described as a “radio silence” policy.

Wildstein characterized Baroni’s role in the incident as primarily serving the interests of Christie, using what he referred to as the “one constituent rule” to guide decisions. This rule appeared to prioritize political considerations over the needs of the community, further underscoring the motivations behind the lane closures.

The fallout from the lane closures has led to serious legal repercussions for those involved. Both Kelly and Baroni are facing conspiracy and fraud charges related to the incident, and they have indicated plans to testify in their defense. The ongoing legal proceedings continue to draw attention to the actions of Christie’s administration and the lengths to which some officials were willing to go to secure political advantages.

As the trial unfolds, the implications of Wildstein’s testimony are significant, not only for those directly involved but also for the broader political landscape in New Jersey. The revelations about the deliberate creation of traffic problems as a means of political pressure raise questions about ethics and accountability in government.

The George Washington Bridge lane closures have become emblematic of the contentious relationship between politics and public service, highlighting the potential for abuse of power when political motivations overshadow the needs of constituents. The testimony in federal court serves as a stark reminder of the importance of transparency and integrity in government operations.

As the case progresses, it remains to be seen how the court will respond to the evidence presented and what consequences will follow for those implicated in the scheme. The public continues to watch closely, as the outcome of this trial could have lasting effects on the political landscape in New Jersey and beyond.

In conclusion, the testimony provided by David Wildstein has opened a window into the inner workings of a political strategy that prioritized personal and political gain over the welfare of the community. The actions taken during the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge have sparked outrage and have raised critical questions about the ethical responsibilities of public officials. As the legal proceedings continue, the implications of this case will undoubtedly resonate throughout the political arena, serving as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of political machinations that disregard the public good.",9.0,-21.0,1009.0,0.225,0.008919722497522299,904.0,-0.7241379310344828,-0.023230088495575223

Bono pointed to nations like Ireland and Great Britain as great countries but suggested that America is different because it’s an idea, one that Trump is “trying to hijack.”

In a recent statement, Bono, the frontman of the iconic rock band U2, voiced strong criticism of former President Donald Trump, labeling him as “potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America.” The musician emphasized his belief that America represents “the best idea the world ever came up with,” a notion he feels is under threat.

It's living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state

(CNN) Florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the November election.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched.

The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.

""So if I had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin,"" says USF Tampa political scientist Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor at the University of South Florida. ""We're to the point where anything is possible. This is just one of those kind of elections.""

All eyes are on central Florida's I-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. The area stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics.

Real_74-Webpage,HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night’s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Here’s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday’s debate? — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet’s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

There’s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night’s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins aren’t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

@HuffingtonPost someone’s upset that #Trumpwins — Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? — Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ? pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y — Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn’t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate – except for the little watched @CNN poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, “Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN’s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.” They actually looks like they’re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, a CNN/ORC poll has revealed that a significant 62% of respondents believe Hillary Clinton emerged victorious. This finding contrasts sharply with numerous online polls that have claimed Donald Trump won by a substantial margin. The disparity between these polling results has sparked a heated discussion about the reliability of different polling methods and the influence of social media on public perception.

The CNN/ORC poll, which involved direct contact with respondents, is seen as a more traditional and potentially reliable measure of public opinion. In contrast, online polls, which can be easily manipulated, have raised concerns about their accuracy. The Huffington Post has specifically questioned the validity of these online polls, suggesting that they may not accurately reflect the views of the broader electorate.

Critics of the online polls have pointed to the behavior of Trump supporters on platforms like 4chan and Reddit, who have been accused of skewing the results in favor of their candidate. This manipulation raises questions about the authenticity of the online polling data and whether it can be considered a true representation of voter sentiment.

In response to the CNN poll's findings, many Trump supporters expressed their dissatisfaction with the Huffington Post's reporting on the polls. They argue that the mainstream media is biased against their candidate and that the online polls, which show Trump in a favorable light, should not be dismissed. Trump himself has claimed victory in all polls except the CNN poll, emphasizing the trending hashtag #TrumpWon on Twitter as evidence of his support.

Adding to the debate, Trump shared a Daily Mail article that suggested most snap polls favored him, despite the CNN findings. This has further fueled the narrative among his supporters that he is the true winner of the debate, even as traditional polling methods indicate otherwise.

The contrasting results from the CNN poll and various online polls highlight the complexities of gauging public opinion in the digital age. While the CNN poll suggests a clear victory for Clinton, the online polls present a different picture, leading to confusion and contention among voters and analysts alike.

As the election season progresses, the debate over the accuracy and reliability of polling methods is likely to continue. The influence of social media and online platforms on public opinion is a growing concern, and the potential for manipulation raises important questions about how we measure voter sentiment.

In conclusion, while online polls may suggest a different narrative, the overall result from the CNN/ORC poll indicates that Hillary Clinton is perceived as the winner of the debate by a significant margin. As both candidates prepare for the upcoming election, the implications of these polling results will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping their strategies and messaging moving forward. The divide in public opinion underscores the challenges faced by both campaigns as they navigate the complex landscape of voter sentiment in an increasingly digital world.",35.0,44.0,556.0,1.75,0.06294964028776978,548.0,2.2,0.08029197080291971
Real_75-Webpage,Tim Kaine on Libertarian ticket: 'Everybody knows they're not going to win',"Story highlights Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine says third-party Libertarian candidates will lose

He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson

(CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose.

""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week.

Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history.

""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. It may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. That's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history.""

Real_76-Webpage,Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s Vice President Joe Biden.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday’s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

“This is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?”

Adding:

“Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

“He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘You’re fired.’ They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

“He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

“If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord… What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.”

And it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Watch Biden lay into Trump here:

PHILADELPHIA – Vice President Joe Biden took to the stage in Philadelphia on Wednesday to rally support for Hillary Clinton, delivering a pointed critique of Donald Trump’s recent remarks during a debate. The Vice President’s speech underscored the stark contrasts between the two candidates as the election approaches.

Biden focused on Trump’s controversial comments regarding the housing market, questioning the Republican nominee’s assertion that he benefited from its failure. “How can anyone take pride in profiting from the suffering of others?” Biden asked, expressing disbelief at Trump’s perspective. The Vice President emphasized that the housing market collapse had devastating effects on countless American families, and he found it troubling that Trump would boast about gaining from such a crisis.

In his address, Biden invoked the legacy of past presidents, including those from the Republican Party, highlighting their moral compass and commitment to American values. He argued that these leaders understood the importance of empathy and responsibility, qualities he believes are sorely lacking in Trump’s approach to politics. “We’ve had presidents from both parties who have had a moral center,” Biden stated, contrasting this with what he perceives as Trump’s absence of fundamental sensibilities.

Biden’s frustration was palpable as he addressed Trump’s pride in not paying taxes, a topic that has drawn significant attention in the campaign. “While everyday Americans are working hard and paying their taxes, Trump seems to revel in avoiding his responsibilities,” Biden remarked. This sentiment resonated with many in the audience, who are grappling with their own financial challenges amid a fluctuating economy.

The Vice President made it clear that the upcoming election presents a decisive choice for voters. “This is a clear choice,” he asserted, urging the crowd to support Clinton as the candidate who embodies the values and principles that Americans hold dear. Biden’s endorsement of Clinton was not just a political statement; it was a call to action for those who believe in a more inclusive and compassionate leadership.

Biden also expressed deep concern over what he described as Trump’s cynicism towards the American people. He warned that such an attitude could undermine the very fabric of the nation, eroding trust and unity. “We need a leader who believes in the American people, not one who looks down on them,” he said, reinforcing the idea that leadership should be rooted in respect and understanding.

As the campaign intensifies, Biden’s remarks serve as a reminder of the stakes involved in the upcoming election.

At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday.

The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.

Story Continued Below

The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.

The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.

""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""

In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.

“This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

In a startling revelation, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) inspector general has reported that 858 individuals who were ordered for deportation were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship. This alarming oversight has raised concerns about the integrity of the immigration vetting process and the potential implications for national security.

The errors stemmed from incomplete fingerprint records maintained by both the DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The inspector general's report highlights that paper fingerprint cards, which were used prior to 2008, were not consistently digitized. This lack of digitization has resulted in significant gaps in the records, complicating the verification process for citizenship applicants.

Further complicating matters, the FBI's records were found to be incomplete because not all fingerprints from immigration enforcement were shared with the agency. This lack of comprehensive data sharing has created a situation where individuals who should have been flagged for deportation were instead granted citizenship, raising questions about the effectiveness of the current immigration system.

While the inspector general's report indicated that those granted citizenship were ""potentially"" ineligible, it clarified that this does not necessarily mean that their citizenship was granted incorrectly. The report also noted that not all applicants with incomplete records were granted citizenship; some had their applications denied based on the same incomplete information.

Among the most concerning findings were three specific cases where previously-deported individuals were granted citizenship and subsequently obtained security clearance for sensitive work. However, their credentials have since been revoked, highlighting the potential risks associated with the oversight.

Inspector General John Roth emphasized the critical need for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to have access to complete fingerprint records to prevent fraud and ensure that only eligible individuals are granted citizenship. The report underscores the importance of accurate record-keeping and data sharing among agencies to maintain the integrity of the immigration process.

The issue of vetting immigrants has become a significant topic in political discourse, particularly for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has frequently criticized the current immigration system. The findings of the inspector general's report are likely to fuel further debate on the effectiveness of immigration policies and the need for reform.

In response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security has stated that it is actively working to correct the issues related to incomplete fingerprint records. The agency is committed to improving its processes to ensure that such errors do not occur in the future.

As the nation grapples with the implications of this report, the focus will undoubtedly remain on the need for robust immigration vetting procedures. The potential for individuals who should be deported to gain citizenship raises serious questions about the effectiveness of current systems and the safeguards in place to protect national security.

The findings of the inspector general serve as a wake-up call for policymakers and immigration officials alike, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to address the gaps in the immigration system. As discussions continue, the importance of accurate record-keeping and inter-agency cooperation will be paramount in restoring public confidence in the U.S. immigration process.",-16.0,5.0,559.0,-1.0,-0.028622540250447227,579.0,0.21739130434782608,0.008635578583765112
Real_78-Webpage,Insiders: The heat is on Hillary,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.

Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.

Story Continued Below

That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.

“She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,” said a Nevada Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.”

“The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,” a New Hampshire Democrat added. “Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.”

One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.

“Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the Ohio Democrat. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.”

Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.

“Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an Ohio Republican. “Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.”

“She has to stop [Trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a Virginia Republican. “All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.”

Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans — most pointed to the GOP nominee’s volatile personality.

“Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,” said a Michigan Republican. “The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.”

“The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?” added a Michigan Democrat. “Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?”

Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:

Most insiders expect Clinton to “win” the debate.

Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

“Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,” said an Iowa Republican.

“[Clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a New Hampshire Democrat.

But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.

“The press wants Trump to win,” said a Florida Democrat. “Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.”

Some Republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction.

“The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,” a Virginia Republican said. “But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.”

Insiders think the debate will matter.

Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.

Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle.

“Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a Michigan Democrat predicted. “The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.”

The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact.

“Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.”

But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump’s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.

“If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an Iowa Republican. “If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.”

Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.

“We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,” an Iowa Republican said. “Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.”

Added a Florida Democrat: “Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.”

As the political landscape intensifies in the lead-up to their first debate on Long Island, Hillary Clinton finds herself under a microscope, facing increased pressure compared to her opponent, Donald Trump. This dynamic has been underscored by a recent POLITICO Caucus survey, which reveals that a significant majority of both Democrats and Republicans—69% and 74%, respectively—believe that Clinton is subject to more scrutiny than Trump.

The heightened expectations for Clinton, the first female major-party nominee, have sparked discussions among political insiders about a perceived double standard. Many Democrats are voicing concerns over the low expectations set for Trump, who is often viewed as inexperienced in the political arena. This disparity in expectations places additional pressure on Clinton, who is expected to perform flawlessly in the debate.

Republicans have acknowledged the scrutiny surrounding Clinton, particularly as polls indicate that Trump is gaining ground. The tightening race has led to a sense of urgency among Clinton's supporters, who fear that any misstep could be magnified in the eyes of the electorate and the media. Insiders suggest that while Clinton is under significant pressure, Trump is also facing his own challenges, primarily due to his volatile personality and the necessity to maintain composure during the debate.

Despite the pressures, a majority of insiders predict that Clinton will emerge victorious in the debate. According to the POLITICO Caucus survey, 76% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans believe that Clinton will ""win"" the debate. This expectation reflects a broader sentiment among party insiders that Clinton's experience and preparedness will give her an edge over Trump.

However, the debate is not without its complexities. Concerns about media bias have surfaced, with some Democrats arguing that the press favors Trump, while some Republicans contend that the media is biased towards Clinton. This perception of bias could influence how the debate is covered and how each candidate's performance is interpreted by the public.

The potential impact of the debate on the race is a topic of considerable discussion among insiders. A notable 66% of Democrats believe that the debate will benefit Clinton, while 52% of Republicans think it will help Trump. This divergence in opinion highlights the polarized nature of the current political climate, where perceptions of candidates can vary dramatically based on party affiliation.

Despite the anticipation surrounding the debate, some insiders express skepticism about its lasting effect on the race. Given the current political climate and the deep voter polarization, there are doubts about whether the debate will significantly alter the trajectory of the campaign. Many believe that voters have already made up their minds, and the debate may serve more as a momentary spectacle than a decisive turning point.

As the debate approaches, the stakes are high for both candidates. Clinton's heightened scrutiny and the expectations placed upon her as a trailblazer in the political arena contrast sharply with the lower bar set for Trump. The outcome of the debate could not only influence the immediate race but also shape the narrative surrounding both candidates as they head into the final stretch of the campaign.",43.0,9.0,2576.0,0.8431372549019608,0.016692546583850932,584.0,0.391304347826087,0.015410958904109588
Real_79-Webpage,Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

In a recent commentary, Frank Wilkenmeyer has taken aim at Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, criticizing their behavior on social media. Wilkenmeyer points out that the Trump brothers often provide a wealth of material for humor, particularly in light of Eric Trump’s recent boast about being featured in a crossword puzzle. To Wilkenmeyer, this display comes off as childish and trivial, especially when juxtaposed against the serious national conversations currently unfolding.

One of the most pressing issues in the national discourse is the ongoing debate surrounding Colin Kaepernick's protest during the National Anthem. Kaepernick, a former NFL quarterback, sparked a movement when he chose to kneel during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. This act of defiance has since ignited a firestorm of reactions, particularly from conservative circles, where many have labeled the athletes who kneel in support of Black Lives Matter as unpatriotic.

Donald Trump Jr. has been particularly vocal in his criticism of Kaepernick, accusing him of disrespecting the troops. This sentiment echoes a broader conservative narrative that equates kneeling during the anthem with a lack of respect for the military. However, Wilkenmeyer argues that this perspective is steeped in hypocrisy. He points out that while conservatives often champion the Second Amendment, they seem to disregard the rights afforded by the First Amendment, particularly when it comes to free speech and expression.

The author emphasizes that patriotism should not be defined by mandatory actions, such as singing the National Anthem. Instead, true patriotism encompasses the right to express dissent and advocate for change. This notion is supported by historical precedents set by the Supreme Court, which has consistently upheld free speech rights in various contexts, including protests and demonstrations.

Wilkenmeyer’s critique of the Trump brothers serves as a microcosm of the larger debate about patriotism and free expression in America. He suggests that the focus on Kaepernick and the athletes who kneel is often misdirected, as it overlooks the fundamental rights that allow individuals to voice their opinions and challenge the status quo. The author argues that the real issue at hand is not the act of kneeling itself, but rather the reaction it provokes from those who feel threatened by dissenting voices.

As the national conversation continues to evolve, it is clear that the actions of public figures, including the Trump brothers, play a significant role in shaping perceptions of patriotism and free speech. Wilkenmeyer’s observations highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be patriotic in a diverse society where differing opinions are not only expected but necessary for progress.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate surrounding Kaepernick’s protest and the reactions from figures like Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump underscore a critical tension in American society. As Wilkenmeyer aptly points out, the hypocrisy of selectively valuing certain amendments over others raises important questions about the true nature of patriotism. Ultimately, the ability to express dissent and advocate for change is a cornerstone of American democracy, one that should be celebrated rather than condemned.",-17.0,9.0,592.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.028716216216216218,585.0,0.42857142857142855,0.015384615384615385
Real_8-Webpage,More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump! – Eagle Rising,"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.

The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category.

Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.

Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.

Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.

Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”. Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said.

Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”

In a week marked by significant political developments, former President Donald Trump appears to be solidifying his position as a formidable contender in the upcoming election. Recent polling data indicates that Trump is either leading or closely trailing his main rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, suggesting a tightening race as the election approaches.

According to a Fox News Poll, Trump is currently at 46%, just one percentage point ahead of Clinton, who stands at 45%. This slight edge is echoed in the LA Times/USC Poll, where Trump boasts a more substantial lead at 47% compared to Clinton's 41%. The Suffolk University Poll also shows Trump leading Clinton by three points, with Trump at 42%. Additionally, in a crucial battleground state like Florida, the CNN/ORC Poll reveals Trump with a four-point lead, further indicating his growing support in key areas.

As the race heats up, gaps in critical battleground states are narrowing, with several states shifting to ""toss up"" status. This trend suggests that Trump's campaign is resonating with voters, potentially altering the dynamics of the electoral map as both candidates vie for crucial electoral votes.

In a bid to appeal to families and working parents, Trump recently introduced a comprehensive childcare plan, which is spearheaded by his daughter, Ivanka Trump. The plan includes several key initiatives aimed at providing support for parents. Notably, it offers six weeks of paid maternity leave for mothers who do not have employer benefits, a significant step towards addressing the needs of working families. Additionally, the plan proposes childcare rebates for low-income families through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which could alleviate some of the financial burdens associated with childcare.

Middle-class families are also set to benefit from the proposed plan, which includes full tax deductions for childcare expenses. This initiative aims to make childcare more affordable and accessible for families across the economic spectrum. Furthermore, the introduction of Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) allows for tax-free savings specifically designated for childcare expenses, providing families with more financial flexibility. The plan also includes tax deductions for stay-at-home parents, recognizing the value of their contributions to family life.

In addition to his childcare initiative, Trump delivered a significant economics speech to the Economic Club of New York, where he outlined his vision for the economy and addressed key issues affecting American workers. This speech is part of a broader strategy to position himself as a candidate focused on economic growth and job creation.

Trump's media presence has also been notable this week. He made an appearance on The Dr. Oz Show, where he disclosed details about his medical history and health status. This disclosure comes at a time when concerns about Hillary Clinton's health have been a topic of discussion, potentially shifting the narrative in Trump's favor.

In a lighter moment, Trump visited The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, where he allowed Fallon to ""mess up his hair,"" showcasing his ability to engage with the public in a humorous and relatable manner. This appearance highlights Trump's strategy of connecting with voters on a personal level, using humor to diffuse tension and build rapport.

Adding to his week of accomplishments, Trump opened a new hotel in Washington, D.C., which has garnered endorsements from military officials and Medal of Honor recipients. This development not only expands his business portfolio but also reinforces his image as a supporter of the military and veterans, a demographic that plays a crucial role in American politics.

In addressing past controversies, Trump tackled the ""birther issue,"" stating that he has put the matter to rest and confirmed that President Obama was indeed born in the United States. This statement aims to quell lingering doubts and refocus the conversation on current issues rather than past controversies.

As the week comes to a close, the author reflects on Trump's performance, concluding that he has had another ""amazing week."" The combination of favorable polling, new policy initiatives, and strategic media appearances suggests that Trump is not only maintaining his support but potentially expanding it as he moves forward in the campaign. Disregarding political correctness, Trump's approach appears to resonate with a significant portion of the electorate, positioning him as a strong contender in the race against Clinton.

With the election season heating up, all eyes will be on how these developments influence voter sentiment and the overall trajectory of the campaign. As Trump continues to navigate the political landscape, his ability to connect with voters and address their concerns will be critical in determining the outcome of the upcoming election.",59.0,58.0,1240.0,1.2291666666666667,0.04758064516129032,875.0,1.8125,0.06628571428571428
Real_80-Webpage,Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground,"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.

Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.

He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.

Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.

Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.

Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.

These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.

Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.

""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.

Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.

Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump.

""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.

Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.

Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""

The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.

Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.

TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.

This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.

""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""

Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""

Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""

""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""

This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.

Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.

In a notable shift in media engagement, former President Donald Trump has become increasingly selective about his appearances, primarily favoring Fox News while largely avoiding other major networks. This strategy, which may serve to energize his base, has drawn criticism for limiting his exposure to challenging questions and frustrating journalists who seek greater access to the former president.

Trump's recent media schedule includes appearances on popular Fox News programs such as ""Fox & Friends"" and ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" as well as a town hall event with Sean Hannity. This focused approach appears to be a calculated move to connect with his core supporters, but it has raised eyebrows among media professionals who argue that it restricts the kind of rigorous questioning that is essential in a democratic society.

Surrogates for Trump have claimed that he is more accessible than his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton. However, this assertion has come under scrutiny, particularly in light of Trump's own media habits. Newt Gingrich, a prominent Trump ally, previously criticized Clinton for not holding press conferences, despite her recent record of six press conferences in just two weeks. In stark contrast, Trump has not held a press conference since July, leading to mounting complaints from reporters about his lack of availability.

David Martosko, a reporter for The Daily Mail, highlighted that it has been over 50 days since Trump last faced the press in a formal setting. Instead, his recent media appearances have leaned more towards entertainment shows rather than traditional news formats, further distancing him from the kind of rigorous journalistic scrutiny that many believe is necessary for a public figure of his stature.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa managed to secure a rare interview with Trump last week, which stood out against the backdrop of a dearth of interviews from major news outlets. Trump's last appearance on CNN was in late August, where he faced tough questioning from Anderson Cooper. His last engagement with NBC was during the widely criticized ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7, which has since been a point of contention among critics.

While Trump has a CBS interview planned, his overall media engagement has noticeably decreased. This trend has not gone unnoticed by television networks, which are actively seeking more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The current landscape highlights a stark contrast to Trump's previous reputation for being accessible to the media.

CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond pointed out that Trump is now less accessible than Clinton, a significant turnaround from the narrative that once surrounded both candidates. Trump's campaign has not publicly commented on their media strategy, but a strategist suggested that the former president is focusing on a conservative audience, which may explain his preference for Fox News.

Critics have pointed out Trump's exclusive appearances on Fox News, emphasizing his notable relationship with Sean Hannity. The upcoming town hall with Hannity is set to address issues concerning African Americans, despite the fact that viewership from that demographic on Fox News is relatively low. This raises questions about the effectiveness of such a strategy in reaching a broader audience.

As Trump continues to navigate the media landscape, his selective engagement raises important questions about transparency and accountability. The former president's approach may resonate with his base, but it also risks alienating a wider audience that seeks a more comprehensive understanding of his policies and positions.

In conclusion, Trump's media strategy reflects a deliberate choice to engage primarily with friendly outlets, which may bolster his support among core followers but limits his exposure to critical questioning. As the political landscape evolves, the implications of this approach will likely continue to unfold, shaping both Trump's public image and the broader discourse surrounding his candidacy.",15.0,22.0,918.0,0.35714285714285715,0.016339869281045753,707.0,0.88,0.031117397454031116

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

Story Continued Below

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.""

Pence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.

The campaign has asserted that the Post's reporting is riddled with ""inaccuracies and omissions,"" particularly regarding claims that Donald Trump utilized $258,000 from his charitable foundation to resolve legal issues.

Pence lent his support to the campaign's position, asserting that the Post's report contains ""a number of factual errors.""

Throughout the interview, Pence maintained a balanced perspective, emphasizing his support for a free and independent press.

Real_82-Webpage,Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.

The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

New Jersey State Police

A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.

Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.

One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.

Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

New Jersey State Police

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.

""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""

Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.

Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

New Jersey State Police

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.

Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.

Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.

A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.

In a significant development, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old man, was captured in Linden, New Jersey, following a series of explosive devices that were discovered in New York City and New Jersey. Rahami's arrest marks a critical moment in an ongoing investigation into the incidents that have raised concerns about public safety in the region.

Born in Afghanistan in 1988, Rahami became a naturalized U.S. citizen after his family immigrated to the United States in 1995. The family reportedly received a Green Card in 2000, allowing them to establish their lives in America. Rahami comes from a large family, which is believed to include as many as seven siblings. 

Rahami's early life in the U.S. saw him attending Edison High School, where he was described by former classmates as a quiet individual with a sense of humor. Following high school, he enrolled at Middlesex County College from 2010 to 2012, pursuing an associate's degree in criminal justice. However, he did not complete his degree during his time at the college.

In addition to his educational pursuits, Rahami worked at the family-owned fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Local residents knew him as a friendly individual, which contrasts sharply with the serious allegations now facing him. 

The Rahami family has had previous legal issues with local law enforcement, having sued for alleged harassment in 2011. However, the case was dismissed in 2012, and it remains unclear how these past experiences may have influenced Rahami's actions.

As investigators delve deeper into Rahami's background, they are examining his travel history, which includes a notable trip to Quetta, Pakistan, from April 2013 to March 2014. This trip has raised questions about potential connections to extremist activities, although no definitive links have been established at this time.

Rahami's legal troubles began to escalate in August 2014 when he was arrested for allegedly stabbing someone. However, he was not indicted in that case, leaving his legal history somewhat ambiguous prior to the current charges.

The circumstances surrounding Rahami's capture were dramatic. He was apprehended after a shootout with police, during which he was shot at least once. Following the confrontation, he was taken to a hospital for treatment. Despite the serious nature of the charges against him, Rahami has reportedly not been cooperating with investigators, even refusing to provide his name during questioning.

As of now, Rahami faces multiple charges, including five counts of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. His bail has been set at an astonishing $5.2 million, reflecting the severity of the allegations and the potential threat he poses to public safety.

In a related development, the Afghan government has expressed its willingness to assist U.S. authorities regarding Rahami. This cooperation could provide valuable insights into his background and any potential connections to extremist groups or activities.

The investigation into Rahami's actions and motivations is ongoing, with law enforcement agencies working diligently to piece together the events leading up to his capture. As the situation unfolds, the community remains on high alert, grappling with the implications of Rahami's alleged involvement in the explosive incidents that have shaken the region.

The case has sparked discussions about the challenges of monitoring individuals with complex backgrounds and the importance of community vigilance in preventing acts of violence. As more information becomes available, the public will be watching closely to see how this case develops and what it may reveal about broader issues of security and safety in the United States.

In the wake of Rahami's arrest, local residents are left to ponder the impact of such incidents on their sense of security. The community's response to the situation will likely shape future discussions about law enforcement, immigration, and the challenges of integrating individuals from diverse backgrounds into American society.

As authorities continue their investigation, the focus will remain on understanding the motivations behind Rahami's actions and ensuring that justice is served in a case that has captured national attention.",-17.0,-23.0,735.0,-0.53125,-0.02312925170068027,768.0,-0.7419354838709677,-0.029947916666666668
Real_83-Webpage,Trump’s puzzling pitch to black voters,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

“The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

“We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.

But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night.

“I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”

Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach.

“I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?”

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

“Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

“I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.”

Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.”

“The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.”

Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.

“They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”

In a bold move to reshape his image and appeal to African-American voters, Donald Trump campaigned at a historically significant African-American church in Cleveland. This event marked a pivotal moment in his outreach efforts, as he positioned himself as a candidate capable of addressing urban issues that resonate deeply within these communities.

During his speech, Trump proposed the expansion of ""stop-and-frisk"" policing policies, a strategy that has faced considerable backlash in black communities across the nation. Critics argue that such policies promote racial profiling and exacerbate tensions between law enforcement and minority populations. Despite this, Trump maintained that stop-and-frisk was an effective tool during its implementation in New York, a claim he reiterated during a town hall meeting with Sean Hannity.

Trump's outreach to black voters is widely perceived as a strategic maneuver to counter accusations of racism that have been levied against him by Democrats, particularly Hillary Clinton. His campaign has been characterized by a series of controversial statements regarding the state of black communities, which have drawn ire from civil rights leaders, including Rep. John Lewis. These comments have sparked debates about the authenticity of Trump's commitment to addressing the concerns of African-American voters.

The Cleveland event was notable not only for Trump's controversial policy proposals but also for the presence of former boxing promoter Don King, who introduced Trump and praised him as a ""gladiator"" fighting against a political system that has historically oppressed minorities. King's endorsement added a layer of complexity to Trump's outreach, given King's own controversial past and the mixed reactions he elicits from various communities.

Flanked by key advisors, including Vice President Mike Pence and Omarosa Manigault, Trump sought to emphasize his differences from typical Republican candidates. This strategic positioning aimed to present him as a candidate who is willing to engage with issues that matter to African-American voters, even as his approval ratings among this demographic remain low. His outreach efforts are not only aimed at winning over black voters but also at moderating the perceptions of white voters who may be wary of his past remarks and policies.

In a surprising turn during his Cleveland appearance, Trump criticized a police officer involved in the shooting of an unarmed black man, suggesting that the officer may have been ""choking"" during the incident. This comment was seen as an attempt to address concerns about police violence and accountability, although it also raised questions about the sincerity of his commitment to reforming policing practices.

Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, has defended him against media accusations of racism, asserting that Trump believes in the unity of the human race. This defense comes in the wake of Trump's ongoing struggle to connect with African-American voters, a demographic that has largely rejected him in favor of Democratic candidates. Cohen's remarks highlight the challenges Trump faces as he attempts to reshape his narrative and appeal to a broader audience.

Throughout his campaign, Trump has accused Democrats of neglecting black voters, claiming that they only seek their votes every four years during election cycles. This assertion is part of a broader narrative that Trump has crafted, positioning himself as a candidate who genuinely cares about the issues facing African-American communities, in stark contrast to what he describes as the empty promises of the Democratic Party.

As Trump continues to navigate the complexities of his outreach to black voters, his campaign strategy remains fraught with challenges. The juxtaposition of his controversial policy proposals, such as stop-and-frisk, with his attempts to connect with African-American communities underscores the difficulties he faces in changing perceptions about his candidacy. The road ahead is uncertain, but Trump's efforts to engage with black voters will undoubtedly shape the narrative of his campaign as it unfolds. 

In conclusion, Trump's campaign in Cleveland represents a significant moment in his outreach to African-American voters. While he seeks to present himself as a candidate capable of addressing urban issues, the effectiveness of his strategy remains to be seen. The backlash against his proposals, coupled with the skepticism from civil rights leaders and low approval ratings among black voters, suggests that his path to gaining support in these communities will be a challenging one. As the election approaches, the implications of Trump's outreach efforts will continue to resonate within the broader political landscape.",-67.0,13.0,1178.0,-1.8108108108108107,-0.056876061120543296,805.0,0.48148148148148145,0.016149068322981366

Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged.

“If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.”

Story Continued Below

Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.”

Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.

But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.”

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.”

Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.

Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.

“I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.”

He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.

“I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.

Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, has commented on the former president's recent acknowledgment regarding Barack Obama's birthplace. While Trump has publicly stated that he believes Obama was born in the United States, he stopped short of declaring Obama's birth certificate as legitimate. This nuanced position has drawn attention, particularly from Arpaio, who has been a vocal figure in the ongoing debate surrounding the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate.

Arpaio, who gained notoriety for his controversial investigation into the legitimacy of Obama's birth certificate in 2011, expressed that Trump's statement did not bother him. He suggested that Trump may possess information that he himself lacks, indicating a level of respect for the former president's insights. ""Maybe he knows something I don't,"" Arpaio remarked, hinting at a complex relationship between the two figures in the context of the birther controversy.

The birther movement, which Trump initially championed, gained significant political traction by insinuating that Obama was not born in the United States. This claim has been widely criticized as racially motivated and has been a source of division in American politics. Recently, however, Trump has faced pressure to distance himself from the birther narrative. In a surprising turn, he attempted to shift the blame for the rumor onto Hillary Clinton, claiming she was the one who initiated the discussion about Obama's birthplace.

Despite Trump's recent shift in stance, Arpaio remains steadfast in his belief that Obama's birth certificate is forged. He continues to pursue his investigation into the document, emphasizing that his focus is on the authenticity of the birth certificate itself rather than the president's birthplace. ""I have no idea now where he was born,"" Arpaio admitted, showcasing a level of uncertainty that contrasts with his previous assertions.

Arpaio has consistently denied that his skepticism regarding Obama's birth certificate is racially motivated. He maintains that his investigation is purely about the document and its legitimacy. This assertion comes amid ongoing debates about the implications of the birther movement and its impact on race relations in the United States.

Interestingly, Arpaio revealed that he did not discuss the birth certificate issue with Trump prior to the former president's recent press conference. This lack of communication raises questions about the alignment of their views and the future of the birther narrative within Trump's political circle.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Arpaio's unwavering commitment to his investigation and his support for Trump highlight the complexities of the birther controversy. While Trump may have attempted to distance himself from the claims that once defined his political rise, Arpaio's steadfastness suggests that the issue is far from resolved. The ongoing dialogue surrounding Obama's birth certificate remains a contentious topic, with implications that extend beyond individual beliefs and into the broader discourse on race and identity in America.

In conclusion, Joe Arpaio's comments reflect a deep-seated commitment to the birther narrative, even as Donald Trump navigates the political ramifications of his past statements. The investigation into Obama's birth certificate continues to be a focal point for Arpaio, who remains undeterred in his quest for answers, regardless of the shifting tides of political opinion.",-9.0,7.0,533.0,-0.5625,-0.016885553470919325,617.0,0.30434782608695654,0.011345218800648298
Real_85-Webpage,Barack Obama at Benjamin Netanyahu meeting: 'He is always very candid with us',"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month

His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office.

Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency.

""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us.""

That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January.

Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

The discussion, which lasted approximately 30 minutes, focused on evaluating the prospects for peace in the region as Obama prepares to conclude his presidency.

During the meeting, Obama expressed a desire to foster a deeper understanding of Israel's future opportunities and challenges, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a stable and secure Israel. This dialogue comes at a critical juncture, as the outgoing president aims to leave a positive legacy in U.S.-Israel relations.

The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been complicated, characterized by Netanyahu's forthrightness, which has occasionally been viewed as undiplomatic. This has been particularly evident in discussions surrounding U.S. policies, including the contentious Iran nuclear agreement, which has been a point of contention between the two leaders.

As Obama approaches the end of his term, this meeting is poised to be the final face-to-face consultation between him and Netanyahu before a new president assumes office in January. Despite the personal tensions that have marked their interactions, Obama is keen on strengthening ties with Israel for the benefit of his successor. Notably, he has expressed support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, indicating a desire for continuity in U.S. foreign policy towards Israel.

As the clock ticks down on his presidency, Obama’s efforts to mend fences with Netanyahu reflect a broader commitment to ensuring a stable relationship between the two nations, even amidst the challenges that have defined their partnership.",25.0,26.0,300.0,2.7777777777777777,0.08333333333333333,301.0,2.6,0.08637873754152824
Real_86-Webpage,McAuliffe hangs with Willie Nelson -- and his weed,"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana

Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert

(CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed.

It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!""

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is.

""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool.""

The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

Real_87-Webpage,The Mystery of Trump’s Man in Moscow: Carter Page,"In March, in a bold “Oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the Washington Post’s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, “I have quite a few more.” The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “Carter Page, PhD.”

Who?

Story Continued Below

Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.”

This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.

“What’s this guy’s name?” says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.

“I had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. “But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘Have you heard of this guy?’”

“Strangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,” Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. “It's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.”

Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.

This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. “I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.” As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?

Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (“I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’” says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump’s own campaign.

What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. “He’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,” says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia’s state oil giant. “People really respect him in this industry. He’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials—including Rosneft head Igor Sechin—during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.

Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at Gazprom,” the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in Russia” and an office “around the corner from Trump Tower.”

Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, “Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a “famous American economist” and “adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.”

All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in Trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.

But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to Page’s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.

So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?

***

I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page’s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.

This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.

OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn’t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive résumé.

Page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. “He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,” his bio reads. “He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.”

Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page’s tenure in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.

So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn’t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “I don’t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says Craig . “It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.”

When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page’s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, “I rolled my eyes at that one.” (He, too, said he hadn’t heard of Page until Trump’s announcement.)

Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?

Turns out, they did.

“His nickname was stranichkin,” from the Russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. “It really irritated our team,” Torchinsky told me over Skype. “We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. These guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” As for Page, “He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” Torchinsky says. “When you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.”

OK, harsh. But then I talked to Page’s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. “He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me.

Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says Aleksashenko.

When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” And, says Aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.”

Trump’s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says Aleksashenko.

***

For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,” he wrote. “Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (“Slave; Pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.

His speech in Moscow’s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “For the last 15 years, I’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak Russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: “We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.” Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.

Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. “He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “That blog post about the slaves. That’s just … strange,” says the Council member.

“He’s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. “You’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.”

***

I should’ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump’s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.

I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page’s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?

But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch’s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “No one let him into Gazprom,” Aleksashenko says. “He didn’t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller’s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.” Another of Page’s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page’s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year… I used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.”

But the meetings did provide him with something else. “Gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them.

After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father’s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from Trump Tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space.

“That’s Carter Page,” says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. “That’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. He’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.”

In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia’s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“I don’t know this person,” said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page’s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. “I give them money, I don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,” he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “Don’t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.”

“You are engaged in onanism,” said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. “It’s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It’s absurd.”

As for the FBI investigation, well, it’s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.” He added, “the story doesn't add up.” What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page’s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.”

***

I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?

“Who?” says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.

“He has no formal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.

Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks’s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?

One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.

One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump’s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,” Burt told me. “And I told him I’d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I’ve forgotten. He’s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?”

Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump’s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. “If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,” this person told me.

“I’m not answering your questions,” Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “Carter Page isn’t someone I’ve interacted with.” Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: “Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He’s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.”

***

Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“Who?” Maybe I wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.

“I don’t know about his Russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. “Every conversation I’ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” He went on. “I couldn’t name a project that I could connect Carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.”

“I don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but I think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.”

Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, “a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ‘I want to be part of the team,’” says the Trump adviser. And that’s how it happened. “He’s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ‘He’s an adviser.’ And now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.”

Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,” one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,” the Russia specialist recalls. “He didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.”

According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page’s trip to Russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.” But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “It’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America’s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It’s what’s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carré novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?”

This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “If Page using his status as ‘Trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: “Carter Page, Ph.D.” Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.

For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?

There doesn’t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,” Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.

In March 2016, Donald Trump, the then-presidential candidate, unveiled a short list of foreign policy advisers during an interview with the Washington Post. Among the names mentioned was Carter Page, PhD, a figure whose background and connections have since sparked considerable debate and scrutiny. Page, who is the founder of Global Energy Capital, presented himself as an expert in investing in Russia and the energy sector. However, his claims have been met with skepticism, as many experts in these fields reported having never heard of him.

Carter Page's assertion of expertise in Russian energy investments was bolstered by his statement that he had been actively sending policy memos to Trump's campaign. He expressed his intention to advise the campaign on energy policy and matters related to Russia. This self-proclaimed role raised eyebrows, particularly in light of subsequent reports indicating that U.S. intelligence agencies were investigating Page for alleged back-channel ties to Russian leaders. Such allegations added a layer of complexity to his involvement with the Trump campaign and raised questions about the nature of his connections to foreign entities.

The scrutiny surrounding Page intensified as critics began to question Trump's overall foreign policy knowledge. Instances of confusion over key groups and figures in international relations have been noted, leading to concerns about the competency of those advising him. Page's background, which includes a vice presidency at Merrill Lynch, was also called into question. Former colleagues described him as unremarkable, suggesting that he lacked the expertise one would expect from someone in a prominent advisory role.

Adding to the controversy, Page has made several statements that have drawn criticism, including praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and sharp critiques of U.S. foreign policy. These remarks have not only raised eyebrows but have also led to further inquiries into his motivations and the potential implications of his views on U.S.-Russia relations.

As investigations into Page's activities during a trip to Moscow began to unfold, attention turned to potential meetings he may have had with individuals under U.S. sanctions. This aspect of his background has fueled speculation about the extent of his connections and the potential risks associated with his advisory role in the Trump campaign. Despite the mounting scrutiny, Page's actual influence within the campaign appears to be minimal. Campaign officials have publicly denied that he holds any formal position or influence, further complicating the narrative surrounding his involvement.

The ambiguity surrounding Carter Page's connections and the implications for U.S.-Russia relations cannot be overstated. As the Trump campaign navigated the complexities of foreign policy, Page's presence on the advisory list raised questions about the vetting process for advisers and the potential for foreign influence in American politics. The unfolding story of Carter Page serves as a reminder of the intricate web of relationships and interests that can shape foreign policy decisions, particularly in an era marked by heightened tensions between the United States and Russia.

In conclusion, the case of Carter Page exemplifies the challenges and controversies that can arise in the realm of foreign policy advisement. As investigations continue and the political landscape evolves, the implications of Page's connections and statements will likely remain a focal point of discussion in the context of U.S.-Russia relations and the broader narrative of the Trump administration's foreign policy approach.",27.0,-6.0,6589.0,0.12796208530805686,0.004097738655334649,620.0,-0.2608695652173913,-0.00967741935483871
Real_88-Webpage,It’s “Trump is HITLER” Month at the Washington Post – Eagle Rising,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post.

On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part,

(…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is.

Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

Six Day’s before Mr. Cohen, another columnist Shalom Auslander wrote, “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles…

The Washington Post is under fire for what critics describe as biased reporting against former President Donald Trump. The newspaper has dedicated a significant number of resources, assigning 20 reporters to investigate Trump, which has raised eyebrows among supporters and commentators alike.

Columnists at the publication have drawn controversial parallels between Trump and Adolf Hitler, with Richard Cohen's recent column suggesting that Trump exhibits ""Hitlerian"" thinking. While Cohen clarifies that he does not consider Trump to be an anti-Semite, the comparison has sparked outrage and debate over its appropriateness.

Critics argue that such comparisons create a double standard in political discourse, particularly noting that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has not faced similar scrutiny or comparisons. This inconsistency has led to further questions about the motivations behind the newspaper's coverage.

Shalom Auslander, a noted commentator, previously warned against equating Trump with Hitler, emphasizing that such comparisons diminish the gravity of historical events. The ongoing discourse highlights the contentious nature of political reporting and the challenges of maintaining objectivity in a polarized environment.

Real_89-Webpage,Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore,"2016 Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore The president’s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.

They’re not laughing anymore.

Story Continued Below

Going into Monday night’s debate, Obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.

“I’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “I feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘Breaking Bad’ here. We’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.”

“There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,” said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.

Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He’s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare—support Democrats.

For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there’s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.

“We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. “But we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.”

Trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.

And the result: Trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama’s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.

Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.

“I don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, I don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.”

But they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama’s America.

“I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. “He’s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.”

For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “Trump has shattered that,” Vietor said. “He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. That’s a bad lesson for people to learn.”

According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton’s chances.

“I’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.

Not everyone’s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.

“He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.

And Democrats’ sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.

“The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,” said Earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.”

But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.

“I’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” Papa said, “than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”

As the political landscape in the United States continues to evolve, the rise of Donald Trump within the Republican Party has prompted a range of reactions from former President Barack Obama and his aides. Initially, there was a sense of humor among Obama’s team regarding Trump’s takeover of the GOP. However, as the election cycle progresses, anxiety has taken root, with concerns growing that Trump may represent a broader segment of America than previously assumed.

The unexpected popularity of Trump has challenged long-held beliefs about public sentiment, leaving many in Obama’s camp grappling with mixed feelings. While there is amusement at the Republican Party's missteps, there is also frustration over the former president's inability to connect with certain segments of the American populace. This duality reflects a deeper understanding of the divisions that have come to characterize American society, as well as the limitations of Obama’s policies and appeals during his presidency.

Recent polling data has revealed a surprising development: Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, are nearly tied in the race for the presidency. This revelation has caught Obama’s team off guard, as they had previously expected a more decisive advantage for Clinton. The close race underscores the shifting dynamics of American politics and the unpredictable nature of voter sentiment.

Former aides to Obama have been vocal in their assessments of Trumpism, emphasizing that it should not be viewed as a part of Obama’s legacy. They attribute the challenges facing the Republican Party to its own choices rather than any influence from the previous administration. This perspective highlights a desire to distance the Obama era from the current political climate, which many see as a departure from traditional Republican values.

Despite the election outcome still being uncertain, concerns linger about the lasting impact of Trump on American politics. His approach has been criticized for undermining civil political discourse, a sentiment echoed by several former aides. The divisive rhetoric and tactics employed by Trump have raised alarms about the future of political engagement in the country, prompting calls for a return to more respectful and constructive dialogue.

Obama himself has expressed a desire for a functional opposition party that can engage in meaningful negotiations on key issues. He laments the lost opportunities for collaboration that have arisen from the current political climate, which has been marked by polarization and hostility. The former president’s yearning for a more cooperative political environment reflects a broader concern about the state of democracy in America.

Interestingly, some former aides have found a sense of schadenfreude in Trump’s divisive impact on the GOP. They note that the internal strife and fragmentation within the Republican Party can be seen as a consequence of Trump’s leadership style and the ideologies he has championed. This perspective suggests that while Trump may have galvanized a certain base, he has also alienated many traditional Republicans, leading to a reexamination of party identity.

Democrats have also taken issue with Trump’s criticisms of the economy, viewing them as hypocritical given the recovery that has been attributed to Obama’s policies. The economic gains made during Obama’s presidency stand in stark contrast to Trump’s narrative, creating a contentious battleground for political discourse. This dynamic has fueled further debate about the effectiveness of past policies and the direction of future economic strategies.

As the election approaches, there is a palpable desire among many Democrats for genuine political competition rather than the legitimization of extremist views within the GOP. The emergence of Trumpism has raised questions about the future of the Republican Party and its ability to reconcile its traditional values with the populist sentiments that Trump has harnessed. This desire for authentic competition reflects a longing for a political landscape where ideas can be debated on their merits rather than through the lens of divisive rhetoric.

In conclusion, the rise of Donald Trump has not only reshaped the Republican Party but has also prompted a reevaluation of the political landscape in America. For Obama and his aides, the journey has been marked by a complex interplay of amusement, frustration, and concern. As the nation moves forward, the implications of Trump’s influence will continue to resonate, challenging both parties to confront the divisions that have emerged and seek pathways toward a more unified political discourse. The legacy of this era will undoubtedly be shaped by the choices made in the coming months, as the nation grapples with the realities of a changing political environment.",-9.0,19.0,1354.0,-0.24324324324324326,-0.0066469719350073855,848.0,0.6129032258064516,0.02240566037735849

Real_90-Webpage,Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

“Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”

Adding:

“This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”

Chelsea then said:

“Stop telling women to smile. We don’t like that. It’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”

Going for Priebus’ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

“You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.”

And that’s exactly right.

In a growing conversation about gender expectations, many women are expressing their disdain for being told to smile, viewing such comments as belittling. This sentiment has gained traction following recent remarks made by Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, who criticized Hillary Clinton for not smiling during an NBC forum. Priebus's comments were met with backlash, as many felt it was inappropriate to impose such expectations on women.

The issue highlights a broader societal double standard, as men are not subjected to the same pressure to maintain a constant smile. This disparity raises questions about the underlying attitudes towards women in public life and the expectations placed upon them.

Comedian Chelsea Handler took to her Netflix show to address Priebus's remarks, questioning his authority to dictate how someone should express themselves. Handler pointed out that telling women to smile is not a friendly gesture; rather, it often carries a negative connotation, reinforcing outdated stereotypes about women's behavior.

In a humorous twist, Handler suggested that women might be more inclined to smile when Hillary Clinton overcomes her health issues and secures a victory against Donald Trump in the upcoming November election. This lighthearted comment underscores the seriousness of the underlying issue while also reflecting the resilience and determination of women in the political arena.

As the conversation continues, it is clear that the expectation for women to smile is increasingly being challenged, with many advocating for a more equitable approach to emotional expression in both personal and professional settings.",15.0,18.0,299.0,1.0714285714285714,0.05016722408026756,287.0,1.8,0.0627177700348432
Real_91-Webpage,Is Donald Trump qualified to be president?,"Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.

H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.”

Likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.

Story Continued Below

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.

But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump’s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?

1. Does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country?

Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump — who swooned after Clinton’s superb convention in Philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.

His resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.

The first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream.

This is not to suggest that Trump can’t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.

Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates — but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care.

The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. “When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.”

Stone argued that Trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.

Trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.

Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD’s Section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?

2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?

Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: “We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.”

That’s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: “For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “Article 12 of the Constitution.” The framers stopped at seven. “He was just listing out numbers,” said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. “I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.”

OK, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “Free Exercise” clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.

3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?

Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.

But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.

Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much).

More serious is the issue of Trump’s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns.

This isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.

4. What’s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there’s the matter of Trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In exposé after exposé, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.

The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.

5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.

But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.

Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary” in Trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.

But it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially George W. Bush’s claims about Iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read POLITICO’s comprehensive “Donald Trump’s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths” for a taste.)

In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “Clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…”

But getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. It’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.

As the first presidential debate of 2016 approaches, the stakes are higher than ever for both candidates, particularly for Donald Trump. This debate is not just another event in the campaign; it is viewed as a critical job interview for the Republican nominee. With the nation’s eyes fixed on the stage, Trump must navigate a complex landscape of expectations, perceptions, and his own controversial history.

Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, also faces significant pressure. She must counter longstanding perceptions of dishonesty that have plagued her campaign and prove her qualifications to lead the country. The debate presents an opportunity for both candidates to address their vulnerabilities and showcase their readiness for the presidency.

Trump has often been characterized as an opaque candidate, with a platform that many see as overly simplistic. His focus on immigration, trade, and political correctness has resonated with a segment of the electorate, but it has also raised questions about his depth of understanding on critical issues. His history of lacking knowledge on key topics, particularly foreign affairs, is a concern for many voters. Trump’s disdain for detailed briefings further complicates the picture, leading to doubts about his preparedness for the complexities of governance.

Despite these challenges, Trump’s popularity remains a mixed bag. He is often cited as the most unpopular candidate in modern history, yet he has gained ground in key battleground states. This paradox highlights the unpredictable nature of the 2016 election and the unique appeal Trump holds for certain voter demographics.

As the debate looms, the focus is expected to shift from traditional campaigning to a more serious assessment of Trump’s qualifications for governance. This shift raises several critical questions that will likely be at the forefront of the debate:

1. **Understanding of Basic Information**: Can Trump demonstrate a grasp of the fundamental knowledge necessary for running the country? Voters are looking for a candidate who can articulate policies and respond to complex issues with clarity and insight.

2. **Respect for Constitutional Principles**: Does Trump respect the American Constitutional principles and traditions that underpin the nation’s governance? His past statements and actions have led some to question his commitment to these foundational ideals.

3. **Financial Transparency**: Trump’s reluctance to disclose financial information, including his tax returns and debts, raises eyebrows. Voters are increasingly concerned about the implications of financial secrecy and what it might mean for his potential presidency.

4. **Charitable Foundation Management**: Concerns regarding the management and transparency of Trump’s charitable foundation have also surfaced. Voters want to know if he can be trusted to handle the responsibilities of the presidency with integrity.

5. **Pattern of Dishonesty**: Trump’s pattern of dishonesty and factual inaccuracies in public statements cannot be overlooked. The importance of truthfulness in leadership is paramount, and voters are keenly aware of the implications of electing a candidate who may not adhere to this principle.

The upcoming debate is not just a platform for rhetoric; it is a crucial moment for both candidates to address these pressing concerns. For Trump, it is an opportunity to shift the narrative and present himself as a viable candidate capable of leading the nation. For Clinton, it is a chance to reinforce her qualifications and counter any lingering doubts about her integrity.

As the nation prepares for this pivotal moment in the 2016 election cycle, the emphasis on truthfulness and knowledge in presidential leadership has never been more pronounced. Voters are looking for a leader who not only understands the complexities of governance but also embodies the values and principles that define American democracy. The debate will serve as a litmus test for both candidates, shaping the trajectory of the campaign and influencing the decisions of millions of voters across the country. 

In conclusion, the first presidential debate of 2016 is set to be a defining moment for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. With high stakes and critical questions on the table, the candidates must rise to the occasion and demonstrate their readiness to lead. As the nation watches, the importance of truthfulness, knowledge, and integrity in presidential leadership will be at the forefront of the discussion, ultimately shaping the future of the country.",18.0,34.0,2547.0,0.21686746987951808,0.007067137809187279,827.0,0.8947368421052632,0.041112454655380895
