Real_1-Webpage,Another Terrorist Attack in NYC…Why Are we STILL Being Politically Correct – Eagle Rising,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

On September 17, at approximately 8:30 PM EST, a significant explosion rattled the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, injuring 29 individuals and causing substantial property damage. The blast occurred on West 23rd Street when a homemade bomb was placed in a dumpster, setting off alarms across the city. The explosion, while alarming, did not claim any lives, which is a relief amid heightened concerns about security in urban settings.

According to law enforcement officials, the explosive device was safely extracted during the night around 2:25 AM and subsequently sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia, for further analysis. Authorities are meticulously examining the circumstances surrounding the explosion to ascertain the motives and identify the culprits involved in this deliberate act of violence.

Adding to the tension in the city, a second suspicious device, described as a ""pressure cooker,"" was discovered shortly after the initial explosion on West 27th Street. While this device did not detonate, its presence intensified fears related to potential coordinated attacks. Fortunately, all 29 individuals who suffered injuries in the Chelsea explosion had been discharged from the hospital by Sunday morning, alleviating immediate health concerns stemming from the incident.

This incident unfolds in the context of previous violence, notably a bomb detonating in a trash can during a charity race in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, earlier that same day. Fortunately, no casualties resulted from that explosion either, but the timing raised alarms about possible similarities between the two events. Investigations revealed that the explosives in both New York and New Jersey were linked to the same individual, further fueling speculation about motives.

The Chelsea explosion, coupled with the earlier incident in New Jersey, has sparked a renewed focus on the threat of terrorism, especially in light of recent high-casualty attacks in other cities worldwide, including Paris and Orlando. The anniversary of the 9/11 attacks also casts a long shadow over the recent events, reminding the public of vulnerabilities that still exist in urban settings.

There exists an ongoing tension in public discourse between the necessity for enhanced safety measures and the fear of political incorrectness in addressing terrorism. As incidents like the one in Chelsea unfold, public and political leaders are reminded of the inevitable balancing act: protecting citizens while maintaining sensitivity to cultural and ideological differences. 

New York City’s Mayor Bill de Blasio has characterized the explosion as an ""intentional act,"" aligning with the growing consensus among officials about the deliberate nature of the incident. Meanwhile, Police Commissioner James O'Neill swiftly ruled out natural gas as a contributing factor, emphasizing the need for thorough investigations into the underlying motives.

Echoing these sentiments, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo did not shy away from calling the explosion an act of terrorism. However, he cautioned against the ambiguity that often accompanies the term, acknowledging that labeling an incident as terrorism can be complex and multifaceted.

In the broader political arena, the incident garnered reactions from prominent figures, including presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Clinton called for solidarity and support for first responders, urging unity in the face of adversity. Trump, on the other hand, seized the moment to advocate for stronger national security measures, emphasizing the need for fortified defenses against potential terrorist threats.

The Chelsea explosion has starkly reminded citizens and officials alike of their vulnerabilities, particularly regarding so-called ""soft targets,"" which include public spaces that are often more susceptible to acts of terrorism. This incident underscores not only the urgent need for strong leadership in countering terrorism but also highlights the pressing need for cohesive strategies that prioritize public safety without succumbing to fears of infringing upon civil liberties.

As investigations continue, the focus remains on identifying those responsible and preventing further incidents. The Chelsea explosion serves as a stark reminder of both the challenges faced by urban areas and the resilience required to confront the ever-evolving threats of terrorism.

As the community continues to grapple with the implications of the explosion, it becomes increasingly apparent that a collective response is essential—not just in the immediate aftermath but as an ongoing commitment to safety and security in the face of potential threats. The road ahead will likely involve both hardened policies and community engagement to ensure that public spaces remain safe havens rather than targets for violence.

In conclusion, the events that transpired in Chelsea illustrate the precarious balance between vigilance and political sensitivity in addressing the current state of terrorism both domestically and internationally. As the nation reflects on these developments, the importance of informed civil discourse and assertive leadership becomes ever more pronounced in safeguarding the well-being of citizens across the United States.

Real_10-Webpage,"Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests","Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.

""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.

The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.

""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""

He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.

""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""

But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.

Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.

During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""

Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.

Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.

""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.

In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",http://abcn.ws/2d4lNn9,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg,"More Candace,Adam Kelsey,Abc News,More Adam",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437,"{""fb_title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@adam_kels"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-22"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-22"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-22 14:33:00"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh""}","- Protests in North Carolina escalated following the police killing of African-American man Keith Lamont Scott.

Charlotte, North Carolina—Protests in the city erupted with increased intensity in response to the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man. The unrest followed a week fraught with tension, ultimately leading to confrontations that unfolded across the city, especially in neighborhoods deeply affected by allegations of police violence.

The protests, which have gained traction over two consecutive nights, have seen demonstrators clashing with police, who have been deployed in riot gear. Law enforcement's response included the use of tear gas against protesters, raising concerns about escalating violence on both sides. 

Among the demonstrators, one person has been reported in critical condition resulting from a gunshot wound. This incident has intensified calls for justice and further scrutiny of police tactics, drawing national attention to issues of systemic violence, particularly against African-American communities.

In the midst of the turmoil, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addressed the unrest during his speech at the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh. He attributed the conflict to issues surrounding drugs, highlighting a narrative often referenced in discussions about urban crime and unrest. Despite this, he also condemned the violence erupting in Charlotte, urging the need for national unity and reflecting on how such civil disorder undermines the United States’ image as a global leader.

While emphasizing the right to peaceful protest, Trump firmly denounced any violent disruptions that threaten public safety. He expressed support for law enforcement and underscored the urgent need for better police training. However, his remarks notably sidestepped the core issue that has catalyzed the protests—the broader context of police violence against African-Americans.

Protesters have been vocal about their motivations, primarily focusing on systemic issues of police violence as their catalyst for demonstrations. Although Trump has made efforts to reach out to the African-American community—questioning what they have to lose by supporting his presidential bid—his statements continue to draw scrutiny. Critics contend that generalizations he has made about African-American communities are misleading and do not accurately reflect the diversity of experiences within these populations.

In a notable example of this criticism, a census report from 2015 indicated that over half of black Americans aged 25 or older hold college degrees, a statistic that contradicts Trump's preceding representation of despair within these communities. This disparity raises questions about the effectiveness and accuracy of Trump's outreach efforts and his rhetoric concerning the conditions faced by African-Americans.

During his speech, Trump referenced stop-and-frisk policies, indicating that they “worked incredibly well” in New York. He later clarified this statement, specifying it was aimed at addressing crime in Chicago. This focus has sparked further debate concerning the racial implications of stop-and-frisk policies, which have been widely criticized for disproportionately affecting African-American and Latino communities.

Additionally, Trump delineated between ""violent disruptors"" and the broader African-American community, asserting the nation's responsibility to improve the living conditions for African-American families. However, many critics argue that without directly acknowledging or addressing the underlying issues of systemic racism and police violence, such statements ring hollow amid a national climate demanding accountability and reform.

As tensions continue to mount in Charlotte, the protests stand as a stark reminder that issues of racial injustice continue to provoke passionate responses from communities across the nation. The calls for justice in the wake of Keith Lamont Scott’s police-involved death have become emblematic of a larger movement seeking to challenge long-standing systemic inequities faced by African-Americans.

Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.

Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”

So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.

Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.

How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right?

In a recent address at the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama articulated a controversial perspective on the balance between liberty and security. He presented a compelling argument for the United States to consider sacrificing certain freedoms in the interest of enhancing safety on both national and global fronts. His remarks have ignited significant debate, with many questioning the implications of such a proposition.

During his speech, Obama emphasized the necessity for powerful nations, including the U.S., to accept constraints that would bolster long-term security. He contended that relinquishing some freedom of action could help bind the United States to international norms, which, in turn, would foster a safer global environment. His assertion calls into question the efforts made to preserve individual liberties in the face of potential threats.

Obama also highlighted the global obligation of nations to assist those accommodating Muslim refugees, arguing that such efforts would contribute positively to global security. His stance suggests that a compassionate approach toward refugees can enhance the safety of nations, aiming to mitigate tension and conflict in an increasingly divided world.

However, this position has drawn criticism, notably with concerns regarding the implications of sacrificing liberty for safety. Critics argue that the notion of relinquishing freedoms contradicts the very principles upon which the United States was founded. They question how diminishing individual rights and liberties can genuinely lead to a safer environment. 

As examples, critics reference the experiences of countries like Germany, which has grappled with considerable challenges following large influxes of refugees. In response to recent terrorist attacks in the U.S., they raise alarms over the potential risks associated with accepting more refugees, suggesting that such policies could inadvertently contribute to domestic vulnerabilities.

Opponents of Obama’s viewpoint highlight the potential ramifications of accepting refugees without stringent vetting processes. They argue that rather than strengthening national security, this approach could introduce risks that pose a threat to American citizens. This skepticism amplifies concerns regarding the delicate balance between humanitarian aid and national security.

The crux of the opposition lies in the belief that Obama’s proposal weakens the United States by suggesting that Americans must concede their rights for the sake of safety. Critics assert that a foundational element of American identity is rooted in the protection of freedoms and liberties, which should not be compromised, even for the sake of security enhancements.

The dialogue surrounding Obama’s remarks reflects deeper societal concerns about how nations respond to threats in a globalized world. Advocates of maintaining individual liberties caution against measures that might lead to a slippery slope, where the erosion of rights becomes a norm rather than an exception. This tension highlights the ongoing discourse about national identity, freedom, and the measures necessary to ensure safety in an unpredictable world.

As the debate continues, it is clear that Obama’s UN address has sparked a crucial conversation about the intersection of liberty and security. While the argument for collective safety is compelling, it raises essential questions about the sacrifices required to achieve such ends. The extent to which nations should prioritize security over freedoms remains a contentious issue in contemporary politics, particularly in the U.S., where the preservation of individual rights has long been a cornerstone of national ideology.

In conclusion, Obama’s remarks at the UN justly inspire a spectrum of reactions that delve into fundamental values. While the need for safety is indisputable, the implications of forfeiting liberty invite scrutiny and warrant discussion, ensuring that the foundational principles of democracy are upheld as nations navigate the complex landscape of global security.",23.0,21.0,576.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03993055555555555,670.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03134328358208955
Real_12-Webpage,Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works,"Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump’s vision.

As he made clear once again in Monday night’s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.”

Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ‘I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “Incomes went up for everybody.”

Story Continued Below

That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “My whole life is about winning. … I always win,” Trump says in explaining why he’s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “Winning the Global Competition.” You don’t get more zero-sum than that.

Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–Trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.

The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.

Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.

No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan’s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.

Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.

Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.

The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders’ powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.

Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. They aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.

We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.

In contemporary American politics, two distinct economic visions have emerged, starkly delineating the paths proposed by political leaders with their respective perceptions of how the economy operates. At the forefront of this discourse are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, each embodying contrasting philosophies that resonate through their policies, campaign messages, and the electorate’s sentiments.

Donald Trump’s worldview is characterized by a zero-sum perspective, a belief that economic gain for one entity invariably results in a loss for another. This outlook frames his political narrative, particularly in his staunch criticisms of international agreements, notably the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump has vehemently criticized NAFTA, labeling it as a detrimental force for American manufacturing. He argues that the agreement has allowed jobs and companies to be ""stolen"" by other countries, creating a sense of urgency and grievance among those who feel that their economic prospects have been adversely affected by globalization.

In sharp contrast, Hillary Clinton presents a view of economic growth that is inherently inclusive. She argues that under her leadership, there should be ample opportunities for all to benefit from economic progress. Clinton often cites the economic policies of her husband’s presidency as evidence of successful pro-globalization strategies that uplifted many Americans while fostering a thriving economy. Her optimistic approach reflects a belief in mutual growth, wherein the overall economy can improve welfare for everyone through effective management and reasonable policy-making.

Trump's campaign declares a clear intent to “Win the Global Competition,” illustrating his commitment to his zero-sum ideology. This mantra resonates deeply with a segment of the electorate that feels overlooked and marginalized by current economic structures. The divide within the electorate is growing, with Trump's supporters aligned with his belief in a win-lose dynamic, while Clinton’s supporters advocate for collaborative growth and mutual benefit.

Furthermore, the economic landscape is rife with disparities, as indicated by the recent Census Report showing an increase in median income. Despite this statistic, many individuals continue to grapple with economic hardship, amplifying the sense of economic precarity. This reality furthers the polarization between those who harbor a zero-sum mentality, often represented by Trump’s supporters, and those who favor an inclusive economic growth narrative, aligning with Clinton.

The sentiments within the American populace are not merely reflective of economic data but are deeply influenced by subjective experiences and the rapid changes observed in the job market and industries. This volatility has notably swayed opinions and shaped the perceptions of viability in economic prospects. The political resonance of Trump’s message is particularly palpable among those adversely affected by these shifts—echoes of the fears and concerns that paralleled the early Progressive Movement. Just as the Progressives once rallied against injustices in a transforming society, today's economic underdogs find solace and hope in Trump’s rhetoric.

Adding an intriguing layer to the political landscape is the notion of covert support for Trump from certain business leaders. These individuals share a worldview akin to Trump’s strategy, perceiving the economic environment through the lens of competitive advantage. Even in an era where the financial industry's popularity has diminished in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, this alignment among certain powerful elites injects a complex dynamic into the unfolding electoral contest.

As the nation inches closer to the forthcoming election, the outcome remains uncertain. Historically, the prevalence of a zero-sum approach in politics has not fostered widespread prosperity or security. The constructs of winning and losing permeate discussions and debate stages, but such a winner-loser mentality tends to perpetuate division and conflict rather than nurturing an atmosphere of collective progress.

In conclusion, the era leading to this election showcases a critical moment in American politics characterized by competing economic ideologies. On one end lies Donald Trump’s zero-sum perspective, which resonates powerfully with those left behind in the wake of globalization and economic restructuring. Opposite him stands Hillary Clinton, advocating for mutual economic growth and recovery, striving to create opportunities that benefit a wider array of citizens. The results of this ideological clash will not just dictate the immediate policies of the next administration but may also shape the socio-economic fabric of the nation for years to come. The dialogue between these two visions presents an opportunity for Americans to reflect on the kind of economic future they envision—a future rooted in competition or one defined by collaboration. This decision holds significant implications, not only for the election's outcome but for the trajectory of American society as a whole.",72.0,70.0,1571.0,1.3333333333333333,0.04583068109484405,850.0,2.1875,0.08235294117647059
Real_13-Webpage,"President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill, Setting Up Showdown With Congress","President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

“I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message.

“I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”

The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.

Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.

The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.

If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.

Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.

""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.

""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.""

But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks.

In a significant political move, President Barack Obama has vetoed the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" (S. 2040) aimed at allowing survivors of the September 11 attacks and the families of victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. The veto, issued today, comes in the wake of overwhelming congressional approval, igniting discussions about a potential override that could reshape U.S. foreign relations.

The legislation in question seeks to enable legal action against foreign governments for damages related to terrorism. While many supporters believe it is a pathway to justice for 9/11 families, President Obama expressed a deep sympathy for those affected but ultimately decided that the bill posed too great a risk to U.S. international standing and security. 

“While I understand the anguish of 9/11 victims' families and their desire for justice, this bill could undermine the principle of sovereign immunity,” the president stated. His administration contends that enacting the legislation could expose U.S. entities to lawsuits in foreign jurisdictions, potentially placing American service members and diplomats at greater risk while compromising U.S. relationships worldwide. 

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, elaborated on the administration’s concerns, highlighting that the legislation could dramatically alter the way the U.S. interacts with allied nations and could trigger reciprocal legal challenges against American officials abroad. “We must protect both the interests of our citizens and the integrity of our international relationships,” Earnest asserted.

The veto puts the Obama administration at odds with many families of 9/11 victims, who have long sought accountability from Saudi Arabia, a nation they believe harbors connections to the terrorists involved in the attacks. Saudi Arabia has vocally opposed the legislation, maintaining that it had no ties to the 9/11 terrorists involved in the tragic events.

The unanimous bipartisan support the bill received in both the House and Senate raises the stakes for a possible veto override. A two-thirds majority in both chambers is required to overturn the presidential veto, and given the bill’s strong backing, an override could reshape the dynamics of the legislative process for the remainder of Obama's presidency. Should an override occur, it would be a notable moment for the current administration, especially given that President Obama has maintained a relatively high approval rating throughout his time in office. The last president to serve without a single veto override was Lyndon B. Johnson, making the prospect even more poignant for Obama.

Political implications also loom for the upcoming presidential election. Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and a key figure in the Obama administration, has publicly stated that she would support the legislation if elected president, adding an additional layer of complexity to the discussions surrounding this contentious issue.

As the legislative battle unfolds, the Obama administration is actively working to prevent a veto override. The conflict between the administration's stance and the wishes of 9/11 families continues to highlight the delicate balance between seeking justice for victims and maintaining America’s international commitments and relations.

In conclusion, the veto of the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" marks a pivotal moment in the Obama presidency, with significant implications for national policy, foreign relations, and the ongoing quest for justice among the families affected by one of the darkest days in American history. As Congress considers its next steps, the resolution of this dilemma remains to be seen.",-7.0,-1.0,550.0,-0.4375,-0.012727272727272728,640.0,-0.05,-0.0015625

There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.

The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.

It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474473199000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUv7x5bXV4,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/riot.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice.

A protest organized by Black Lives Matter activists in North Carolina turned chaotic yesterday evening as tensions erupted into violence, raising serious concerns about the implications for the ongoing civil rights movement. The unrest began as a reaction to the shooting of a black man, prompting demonstrators to take to the streets in a passionate outcry against racial injustice. However, what started as a peaceful protest quickly spiraled into destructive behavior that has drawn heavy criticism.

As the evening unfolded, protesters became increasingly aggressive, throwing rocks at vehicles and blocking a major highway, causing significant disruption. Amid the chaos, a female truck driver found herself in a precarious situation when her vehicle was ambushed by rioters. In a scene that highlighted the unsettling turn of events, rioters looted her truck and set its cargo on fire—all while she was still inside. The driver's desperate attempts to seek help were met with frustration as she called the police for assistance; unfortunately, her pleas went unanswered.

Eyewitnesses captured the unfolding violence, with a media helicopter documenting the disturbing scenes below. Footage taken during the incident showcased the intensity of the skirmishes, showing protesters clashing with law enforcement and the events leading to injuries among officers. In total, 16 police officers were reported injured throughout the course of the disturbances, which ultimately led to the shutdown of the freeway.

Critics of the protests have voiced their concerns about the actions of the demonstrators, arguing that such violence and turmoil only serve to undermine their cause while exacerbating existing racial tensions in the community. The aggressive behavior displayed during the protest has sparked a debate about the effectiveness of such tactics in achieving meaningful change. 

In reflecting on the current state of the civil rights movement, many draw comparisons to the teachings of iconic leader Martin Luther King, Jr. His philosophy emphasized the principles of love, non-violence, and integrity as fundamental to the fight for justice. Supporters of peaceful protest argue that true progress can only be achieved through methods that align with these values, suggesting that the recent actions taken by demonstrators stand in stark contrast to the ideals King championed.

Community leaders and advocates are now calling for a renewed commitment to peaceful demonstration and constructive dialogue as a means to resolve underlying issues of racial inequity. They assert that the path to change cannot be paved with violence and destruction but rather through understanding, empathy, and a collective effort towards justice. 

As the dust settles in the aftermath of the protest, the hope remains that the movement can refocus its efforts on educational initiatives and peaceful actions that honor the legacy of leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. By fostering a spirit of unity and collaboration, activists may find a more effective route towards enacting change within society.

As the community grapples with the implications of these events, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of maintaining a dialogue that prioritizes peace over violence, courage over chaos. If the goal remains justice and equality, the methodology must reflect a commitment to those ideals, working towards a brighter future for all.",-44.0,-26.0,572.0,-1.6296296296296295,-0.07692307692307693,585.0,-1.368421052631579,-0.044444444444444446
Real_15-Webpage,10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.

The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.

Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:

1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.

When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.

Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.”

He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.

2. Personal Attacks Came Early

Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker.

Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics.

“For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.

3. Trading Barbs Over Trade

Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.

“And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said.

Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”

Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.”

“Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said.

Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”

4. Trump Asks ‘Why Not’ Blame All the World’s Problems on Clinton

Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.”

Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?”

Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“

Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""

5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns

Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.

“I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.

Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said.

“I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?

“Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.

6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage

Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.

At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate.

Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015.

“Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”

7. Clinton Defends Being ‘Prepared’ When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail

Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff.

""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.”

Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.

8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion

Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.

“Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said.

Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.”

“They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal.

Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.

9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope

Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.

“I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”

Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.”

The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?""

Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.”

Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”

10. Sparring Over Stamina

Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.”

""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.”

Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.

""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said.

She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:

In a pivotal moment for the 2016 presidential race, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump faced off in their first general election debate on September 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. The encounter, attended by millions of viewers, set the stage for a fierce contest that encapsulated the contrasting styles and policies of both candidates.

From the outset, the debate revealed the complicated relationship between Clinton and Trump, characterized by both friendly gestures and underlying sarcasm. It was clear that both candidates were keen to make an impression while simultaneously trying to undermine the other’s credibility and experience.

Hillary Clinton took the opportunity to open the debate with a pointed jab at Trump’s business background. She referenced his financial beginnings, asserting that he had borrowed $14 million from his father to kickstart his business ventures. This was a calculated move, aimed at framing Trump as someone who benefited from privilege rather than as a self-made businessman.

In response, Trump minimized Clinton's remarks, arguing that the loan from his father was minor in the grand scheme of things. He emphasized that he had successfully transformed that initial capital into a multi-billion dollar enterprise, positioning himself as a quintessential example of American success and entrepreneurship. This exchange effectively set the tone for the night, highlighting the stark contrasts in their backgrounds and viewpoints.

As the debate progressed, tensions flared during a particularly heated exchange over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a significant trade deal that had sparked considerable debate among both candidates and their supporters. Trump accused Clinton of having supported the TPP in the past, criticizing her for what he framed as a lack of judgment on critical economic issues. Clinton vehemently denied the accusation, insisting that her views had evolved and she had always prioritized American workers, aiming to reinforce her stance as a candidate who would prioritize domestic concerns.

The discussion took another intriguing turn when Trump attempted to shift the blame for national challenges, suggesting that he was unwarrantedly being held responsible for the issues plaguing the country. This comment sparked a caustic retort from Clinton, who utilized sarcasm to underscore what she perceived as Trump's evasion of accountability. This exchange further demonstrated the distinct approaches both candidates took towards leadership and responsibility.

In another exchange, Trump defended his controversial decision not to release his tax returns, which had drawn criticism from various quarters. He linked his decision to the ongoing controversy surrounding Clinton's deleted emails during her tenure as Secretary of State. Trump's contention that both issues were equally relevant to the voters showcased his strategy of deflecting criticism while drawing attention to his opponent's own troubles.

The debate did not shy away from delving into the birther controversy, a topic that Trump had long championed by questioning President Obama’s birthplace. While Trump attempted to distance himself from earlier claims that had amplified racial tensions and division, Clinton seized the moment to criticize Trump for his past assertions, which she argued displayed a fundamental disregard for the truth and for the dignity of the office.

Discussions turned personal as Clinton sought to defend her debate preparation against Trump's insinuations regarding her campaign’s effectiveness. Acknowledging the stakes of the election, she expressed confidence in her readiness, while Trump attempted to depict her as unfit and out of touch. This set up a classic debate dynamic where experience was pitted against an outsider perspective.

The topic then shifted to law enforcement, where Trump voiced his support for the controversial ""stop and frisk"" policing method, which had been criticized for its impact on minority communities. Trump asserted that these policies had positively contributed to safety in New York City, drawing on his experience in the real estate world and his perception of urban management. However, this assertion prompted questions from Clinton about the broader implications of such practices and their potential for disproportionate harm to specific demographics.

One of the most contentious points in the debate arose when Trump stated he was not in favor of the Iraq War, despite existing evidence contradicting his assertion. Clinton capitalized on this discrepancy, utilizing it to question Trump’s credibility and ability to accurately assess and communicate his beliefs on critical foreign policy decisions. This moment underscored a recurring theme of the night: the importance of honesty and accountability in political discourse.

As the debate drew to a close, Trump focused on questioning Clinton's stamina to fulfill the demanding role of president. In response, Clinton highlighted her extensive experience in public service and criticized Trump’s previous comments about women, emphasizing her commitment to representing all Americans, while pointing out what she characterized as Trump's unfit behavior and rhetoric.

Overall, the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump served as a microcosm of the 2016 election, filled with tension, sarcasm, and pointed exchanges. Each candidate showcased their style, attempting to appeal to the electorate while simultaneously attempting to undermine the other's foundations. With the stakes higher than ever, the debate illuminated the divergent paths that both candidates would pursue in the coming weeks, as they sought to secure the presidency in one of the most consequential elections in U.S. history.",50.0,-8.0,2076.0,0.6024096385542169,0.024084778420038536,982.0,-0.22857142857142856,-0.008146639511201629
Real_16-Webpage,Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

“I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

“It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

“Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege.

Charlotte, NC – On a poignant night at the Charlotte city council meeting, peaceful protesters gathered to voice their concerns against police violence in the wake of the tragic shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. The atmosphere was charged with emotion as community members articulated their grief and frustration, emphasizing the pressing need for accountability and transparency in policing.

Among the most powerful voices was that of a young girl, Zianna Oliphant. Her heartfelt address to the council resonated with the audience, specifically when she spoke about the devastating impact of police shootings on children. Zianna poignantly highlighted how such violence permeates the lives of Charlotte's black community, inflicting deep emotional scars that are difficult to heal.

Reflecting on the personal loss faced by families, Zianna expressed her sorrow about the loss of parents and the heavy burden of planning for burials, making particular mention of Scott's seven children. Her speech brought to light the stark reality and enduring pain experienced by the community, exemplifying that the repercussions of such tragedies extend far beyond immediate family members.

The wounds from Scott’s death, which occurred over a year ago, have been slow to heal, prompting a series of protests that frequently escalated into chaos. What began as peaceful demonstrations in response to news of Scott's shooting has grown into a larger movement advocating against systemic injustice. However, several protests encountered turbulence, resulting in confrontations with police that saw demonstrators facing tear gas and rubber bullets.

Tensions have consistently risen during these protests, with instances of looting, highway blockages, and aggressive encounters between demonstrators and law enforcement officials. The city's atmosphere has grown increasingly strained, reflecting a community grappling with anger and frustration over the circumstances surrounding Scott's shooting.

During the recent council meeting, Mayor Jennifer Roberts sought to restore order as protesters filled the chamber with chants and pointed criticisms. Her calls for decorum highlighted the difficulties of managing such a divided atmosphere, as voices demanding justice echoed throughout the venue.

Following the meeting, demonstrators intensified their calls for the release of the full video of Scott's shooting. The demand for transparency has taken center stage, with community advocates stressing the importance of making all available footage public. Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, reiterated this message in an interview, firmly advocating for the full disclosure of events leading up to the shooting. “We need transparency,” he remarked, underscoring the community's call for clarity in the face of lingering uncertainty.

While Police Chief Kerr Putney has released some footage from the incident, significant questions remain unanswered. The community is left wondering whether Scott posed a genuine threat or was armed when officers approached him, making the need for a complete account of the event even more critical in restoring trust between law enforcement and residents.

As Charlotte continues to grapple with the aftermath of Scott's death, the calls for justice and reform grow louder. Protesters remain undeterred, their resolve only strengthened by the emotional toll of recent incidents. The need to address police violence and its far-reaching effects on families, particularly children, stands as a testament to the crucial work that lies ahead for the city in its journey towards healing and reform.",-57.0,-42.0,570.0,-2.28,-0.1,612.0,-1.826086956521739,-0.06862745098039216

Real_18-Webpage,Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night’s big debate: Don’t let Donald Trump get away with it.

And Trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.”

Story Continued Below

The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.”

“The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,” Silver tweeted.

During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.

“We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told “CBS This Morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, “that that simply be checked.”

“The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.

But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump’s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he’s a Democrat and the system is “very unfair.” The “NBC Nightly News” anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.

“I don’t know that he knew what Lester Holt’s voter registration was,” said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. “He didn’t lie,” Conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.”

In a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, Monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn’t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.

But Clinton’s campaign has beat up on Holt’s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. “In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” Janet Brown, the commission’s executive director, told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

For her part, Clinton won’t let Trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn’t, either.

“There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.”

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.

“I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “You can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but I don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.”

Trump’s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp’s preparation for two Trumps.

“We don’t want Donald Trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We’re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” Mook told NBC’s “Today.”

Asked about Clinton’s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that “it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.”

But Conway shot down the notion that there’s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that “Overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and Conway joined the pile-on.

“He’s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,” Conway said. “And that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.”

After Mook warned against “a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” Conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.”

“I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.”

Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.

“I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.

“What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,” Conway said. “Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.”

Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance.

“So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself — and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.

""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""

As the nation gears up for what promises to be one of the most pivotal debates of the election cycle, Hillary Clinton's campaign is firmly focusing on the urgent need to hold Donald Trump accountable for his statements and actions. With polls indicating a tightening race, predictions of a “dead heat” between the candidates are becoming more prevalent among analysts. This election’s atmosphere is charged not just with political tension, but with accusations of bias, media manipulation, and the broader questions of accountability and truth in politics.

A significant point of contention before the debate is the role of the moderator, Lester Holt. Clinton's campaign has proactively urged Holt to fact-check Trump in real-time, expressing deep concerns regarding the potential for misinformation during the debate. A move that aligns with increasing worries about the spread of falsehoods in political discourse, Clinton's request highlights her team’s commitment to accountability in a race where the stakes have never been higher.

In stark contrast, Trump’s campaign is pushing back against the notion that Holt should serve as a fact-checker. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, has publicly defended Trump's assertions of Holt’s bias, drawing attention to Holt's registered Republican status while attempting to frame claims of bias as part of a larger narrative of victimhood against the media. Trump’s camp argues that Holt’s neutrality cannot be taken for granted and that the debate should focus on candidates presenting their positions without external interruptions.

This clash over the moderating role brings to light recommendations from the Commission on Presidential Debates, which advises against moderators fact-checking candidates during the event. They maintain that candidates should be responsible for correcting inaccuracies themselves, a viewpoint that echoes an established norm in debate formats. Supporters of this approach argue that allowing candidates to navigate their own veracity encourages personal accountability and reflects authenticity in political engagement.

Indeed, Clinton’s communication director has been vocal about the importance of addressing Trump's history of false statements, insisting that the debate is an opportunity for the American public to hear about these inaccuracies. The urgency behind this sentiment is likely fueled by polling data showing Trump either even with or ahead of Clinton in several surveys. Such data underscores the pressing need for Clinton to counter Trump’s narratives effectively and to grab the public's attention on key issues.

On the other side, Trump’s campaign, supported by former aides, plays down the need for a fact-checking moderator, emphasizing the candidates' ability to drive the debate entirely on their own. This sentiment signals a strategic determination to navigate the debate landscape without external influence, suggesting a philosophical divide between the campaigns regarding how to engage with the electoral process.

As both teams prepare for the debate, they have surfaced different expectations of how the event will unfold. Clinton has faced criticism for her perceived robotic demeanor in public appearances, while Trump has been accused of lacking compassion in his messaging. Such criticisms feed into broader strategies, as both campaigns consider how to leverage their strengths — and how best to manage their weaknesses—on a national stage.

Moreover, Conway has raised concerns that Clinton may attempt to strategically leverage gender narratives during the debate, suggesting that framing might distract from Trump’s performance. Such concerns reflect the understanding that narratives in politics often shape public perception dramatically, and both campaigns are acutely aware of the nuances involved in portraying their candidates favorably.

Surrogate Rudy Giuliani, speaking on Trump’s behalf, has offered advice to the candidate emphasizing the importance of authenticity. He has encouraged Trump to focus on being himself rather than getting caught up in the intricate details of Clinton's policy discussions. This advice underscores a consistent theme in Trump's campaign: that connecting with voters personally and emotionally can often outweigh a purely intellectual discussion on policy.

The lead-up to this crucial debate encapsulates the broader dynamics of the current election cycle. With both campaigns playing to their strengths and addressing criticism, the tension is palpable. As they navigate issues of bias, misinformation, and accountability, the stakes have been raised considerably, with both candidates keenly aware that this debate could very much influence their political futures.

In the realm of American politics, where public perception and debate performance often determine the trajectory of electoral contests, the upcoming debate is poised to illustrate just how these narratives will play out in real-time. Ultimately, it will be the voters who sift through the rhetoric, seeking clarity amidst the chaos, and hoping to hold both candidates accountable for their statements and promises in a tightly contested race.",-11.0,2.0,2057.0,-0.22,-0.0053475935828877,879.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0022753128555176336
Real_19-Webpage,Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?,"I’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I’m pretty much baffled.

The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: “You’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.

Story Continued Below

Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that’s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”)

Further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).

By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump—bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post—but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump—and he's still standing.

Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history.

The Focus Is on “Moments”—But They’re Not Always The Key

Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:

“Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked Americans ‘are you better off?’ Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.”

These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It’s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “You’ve all become theater critics.”)

But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.

The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.

There Are Three Debates, Not One—And That Can Matter A Whole Lot

One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th—barely a week before the election.

Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That’s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.

Here, I think, is an opening for Clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).

Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo

The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.

“Well,” he said, “they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.”

Judo, however, can cut both ways. There’s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.

“Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.”

Debates Are NOT Decisive

One last note. It’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory.

In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.

Of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. So you’ll probably want to tune in anyway

As the race for the presidency heats up, the eyes of the nation are increasingly focused on the impending debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. With nearly four decades of experience analyzing presidential debates, including pivotal moments such as the debates between John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey, the forthcoming contests raise numerous questions about strategy, effectiveness, and ultimately, influence on voter sentiment.

One of the key challenges in strategizing for Hillary Clinton in her face-off against Donald Trump lies in the unpredictable nature of her opponent. Unlike any candidate before him, Trump has shown a remarkable ability to defy conventional political norms and expectations. This unpredictability complicates Clinton's best-laid plans as she prepares for the debates. Traditionally, experience and knowledge of the issues have been advantageous traits for candidates; however, with Trump in the picture, Clinton's extensive political resume could become a double-edged sword.

Indeed, Trump has a unique opportunity to wield “political judo” against Clinton. By framing her wealth of experience as a liability linked to the current political disarray, he could potentially turn one of Clinton's greatest strengths into a glaring weakness. This tactic of repurposing strengths into vulnerabilities has long been a strategy in political rhetoric, and Trump’s approach indicates he is well-versed in this art.

Trump's debate position shares similarities with that of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election cycle. Reagan successfully appealed to undecided and educated voters, and it appears that Trump is eyeing a similar demographic. In a political landscape rife with volatility, the ability to connect with this key group could very well determine the outcome of the debates. As Clinton prepares her strategy, this challenge looms large, beginning with how well she can address her own issues of “honesty and trustworthiness” while also deflecting Trump's notable attacks.

Historically, pivotal debate moments, though memorable, have not always dictated the final electoral outcomes. This suggests a nuanced approach to how both candidates might evaluate their performance after each debate. Indeed, history reminds us that each debate can serve as a turning point from which candidates can recover. Should Clinton stumble, there will be ample room in subsequent debates to recalibrate her performance and messaging.

One avenue through which Clinton could thrive is in town hall debate formats. In these intimate settings, candidates are often able to forge a closer connection with voters, addressing personal concerns directly. Clinton has the opportunity to leverage this format to her advantage by relating her policy proposals to the tangible issues facing everyday Americans, while also shining a light on the inconsistencies in Trump’s narrative.

Moreover, in countering Trump’s claims regarding his purported business success, Clinton might focus on critiques surrounding his transparency, particularly concerning his tax returns. By bringing attention to these areas, she could effectively undermine the credibility of Trump’s self-portrayal as a successful businessman, aiming to shift the narrative in her favor.

However, it is essential to keep in mind that while the debates will be closely watched and widely discussed, they are unlikely to prove decisive. Numerous underlying factors—including economic conditions leading up to the election and the highly polarized electorate—will play significantly larger roles in determining the ultimate outcome of the race.

As the nation braces for these debates, the public is encouraged to tune in. Given the tight nature of the competition, each exchange has the potential to sway undecided voters and impact campaign trajectories. The stakes are undoubtedly high for both candidates as they prepare to go head-to-head. The debates are set to become principal platforms where the delicacies of strategy, persuasion, and public perception will unfold, creating an invaluable moment in the annals of American political history. 

In conclusion, as we look forward to the forthcoming debates, Clinton’s journey revolves around her ability to navigate this unpredictable landscape, address challenges with fortitude, and connect with voters in a manner that feels both authentic and relatable. The challenges she faces against Trump are formidable, but as history has shown, the outcomes of debates can shift dramatically based on the instinct, preparation, and execution displayed on stage. With the world watching, each candidate’s performance will not only reflect their campaign's strategy but also resonate with the electorate's sentiment. The time for them to shine—or falter—will soon arrive as America holds its breath for what could be a defining moment in the 2024 presidential race.",34.0,44.0,1979.0,0.5151515151515151,0.017180394138453764,841.0,1.375,0.052318668252080855
Real_2-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have',"Story highlights ""This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" Clinton said

The deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage in the election

Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.

""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.""

The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.

In a poignant address at a recent campaign event, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke out against the troubling trend of police killings of African-American men, labeling the situation as ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable."" Clinton's remarks were particularly focused on the tragic shooting deaths of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma and Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina, two incidents that have sparked national outrage and protests.

Clinton highlighted the urgent need to recognize the ongoing loss of African-American lives in encounters with law enforcement. She noted that while there are still many unanswered questions surrounding these incidents, the growing list of victims is a stark reminder of the broader issue at hand. ""Too many lives have been lost unnecessarily,"" Clinton stated, conveying her emotional connection to the events unfolding across the country.

While acknowledging that there is much to learn about the circumstances surrounding each case, Clinton urged the public to approach the situation with care. She cautioned against targeting police officers during the protests that have erupted in response to these deadly encounters, advocating for a constructive dialogue instead.

As discussions surrounding police accountability and systemic racism continue to take center stage, Clinton's comments resonate with a community yearning for change and justice. By emphasizing the gravity of these incidents, she seeks to galvanize support for systemic reforms and promote healing rather than division. The call for understanding, alongside a recognition of the painful realities faced by many, highlights the critical conversation surrounding law enforcement and racial equality in America today.",-27.0,-20.0,304.0,-2.25,-0.08881578947368421,299.0,-2.0,-0.06688963210702341

Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton.

“The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?”

“I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.”

Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race.

“He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”

Real_22-Webpage,Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.”

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.”

Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

This week, the Senate returned to session with Democrats spearheading a bill aimed at increasing transparency among presidential candidates. The proposed legislation, led by Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), seeks to mandate that candidates release their tax returns within 15 days of obtaining their party’s nomination. This move is designed to ensure that the financial backgrounds of individuals vying for the presidency are made public, allowing voters vital insights into the personal finances of their potential leaders.

If a candidate fails to release these tax documents in the specified time frame, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would be required to make the filings public after an additional 30 days. Prominent advocates for this legislation, such as Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), have expressed optimism that the Senate will soon vote on the bill, signaling a potentially significant shift in the expectations surrounding financial transparency for presidential hopefuls.

Notably, the introduction of this bill comes amidst heightened scrutiny of the financial disclosures of various candidates. Hillary Clinton, along with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has released over 30 years of tax returns, setting a standard that many expect future candidates to follow. The current debate raises questions about transparency, especially considering that since 1976, only one president, Gerald Ford, did not disclose his tax returns while in office.

The recent discussions have also brought to light historical incidents involving candidates who faced public pressure over tax disclosures. During the 2012 election, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid publicly challenged then-candidate Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of his tax returns, hinting at potential financial impropriety. In a turn of events, significant details concerning Romney's taxes emerged just before the election, supporting the suspicions raised by Reid and other Democrats.

Furthermore, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has been vocal in criticizing President Donald Trump, asserting that Trump is ""ethically compromised"" and labeling him as the ""king of the welfare kings."" This rhetoric follows a trend of concerns voiced by lawmakers regarding the necessity for presidential candidates to be fully transparent about their financial dealings. 

The tradition of financial disclosure among presidential candidates traces its roots back to figures like George Romney, Mitt Romney’s father, who played a pivotal role in establishing these expectations. As the current political landscape evolves, there is a growing demand for clarity, particularly regarding Trump’s tax returns, which stand in stark contrast to the well-documented finances of candidates like Hillary Clinton.

In light of these ongoing discussions, the article underscores the imperative for Congress to take action not just on enhancing financial transparency, but also regarding calls for impeachment against President Trump related to alleged crimes. As the Senate deliberates on the proposed bill, the outcome could reshape the future of financial disclosure in American politics, ensuring that voters have access to important information that could influence their electoral decisions.",-9.0,6.0,496.0,-0.6428571428571429,-0.018145161290322582,553.0,0.35294117647058826,0.0108499095840868
Real_23-Webpage,Dem congressman to IRS: Audit the Trump Foundation,"Story highlights Trump reportedly used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes,"" Sander Levin wrote to the IRS

Washington (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen

The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.

The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.

This call for an examination comes in light of reports suggesting that former President Donald Trump misused charity funds to cover legal settlements. Levin emphasized the importance of utilizing charitable funds solely for charitable purposes, rather than for personal business objectives.

The Washington Post revealed that Trump allegedly appropriated $258,000 from his charity to resolve various lawsuits.

Real_24-Webpage,Armed Intruders Break in House…Armed Resident Responds – Eagle Rising,"Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun.

The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway.

After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away.

In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.”

Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.”

Early Friday morning, an alarming home invasion occurred in an Atlanta residence when three armed men broke into the home around 4:00 a.m. The homeowner's co-worker, present for work-related reasons, quickly responded to the chaos by drawing his handgun.

The incident, which was captured on surveillance cameras inside the house, escalated as the co-worker fired all rounds at the intruders. The aggressive response caused the trio to flee in panic, with one of the suspects jumping through a glass door in his haste to escape.

Tragically, one of the intruders succumbed to gunshot wounds in the driveway of the residence, while the other two suspects managed to evade capture and remain at large. Following the incident, the homeowner was seen calmly comforting his co-worker and securing the firearm.

Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington addressed the situation, emphasizing the homeowner's right to defend their property. He highlighted the importance of the surveillance footage, expressing hope that it would aid in identifying the two remaining suspects, who notably were not wearing masks during the break-in.

Real_25-Webpage,"Post-debate, Trump team hits moderator Holt for 'some hostile questions'","""He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about,"" Donald Trump said about Lester Holt. | Getty Post-debate, Trump team hits moderator Holt for 'some hostile questions'

Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.

“They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.”

Story Continued Below

Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.

“I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.”

“Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.”

Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.

""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.

“I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""

While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.

“I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”

Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado.

“I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl.

In the wake of a highly anticipated debate, former President Donald Trump took to various platforms to express his frustrations concerning moderator Lester Holt's performance. Trump asserted that he faced a series of unfair questions during the debate, suggesting that Holt's style was particularly biased against him. His criticisms came amid a contentious backdrop surrounding the 2016 presidential race, where Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were expected to clash on key issues.

Trump specifically targeted Holt for what he perceived as an undue focus on his past controversies and challenges, while failing to address critical issues surrounding Clinton's candidacy. In his remarks, Trump lamented the moderator's decision to emphasize a 40-year-old housing discrimination lawsuit against him, suggesting that such topics were irrelevant in the current political context, particularly when Clinton's email scandal and the Benghazi incident remained untouched. “If they’re going to go after my past, why not ask the same about Hillary?” Trump said, highlighting what he saw as a double standard in the debate proceedings.

Evaluating Holt's overall performance, Trump assigned a grade of C+. While he acknowledged that Holt began the debate with issue-based inquiries that were straightforward, he deemed the latter part of the moderation to be biased and not in the spirit of fair questioning. ""He started off okay, but then it got personal,"" Trump noted, expressing his discontent with the direction of the questions as the debate progressed.

Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential candidate, also weighed in, voicing his disappointment regarding Holt's handling of the debate. Pence highlighted that significant topics, particularly those related to Clinton's record, were notably absent from the discussion. ""There were numerous missed opportunities to challenge Clinton on Benghazi and her foundation,"" Pence said, expressing solidarity with Trump's frustrations.

Adding to the chorus of discontent, Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, reiterated the narrative of missed chances during the debate. Conway emphasized that Holt's focus on Trump’s controversies overshadowed critical discussions about Clinton's actions, especially regarding the Benghazi incident and allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation. “These are pressing issues that deserve attention, yet they were entirely sidelined,” she stated.

During the debate, Trump raised eyebrows by claiming that his microphone experienced technical issues that may have impacted his overall performance. He suggested that the perceived malfunction was not merely a coincidence but hinted that it might have been tampered with deliberately to hinder his speaking abilities on stage. ""It didn’t sound right. I could barely hear at times. There’s something there,” Trump contended, directing skepticism towards the integrity of the debate setup.

While Trump asserted that he maintained control throughout most of the debate, he admitted that Clinton's reference to Alicia Machado—who Trump had previously insulted—managed to unnerve him. He recalled the moment when Machado's name came up, explaining that it struck a chord and succeeded in getting under his skin. “They brought her up at a time when I was hitting my stride, and it was a surprise to me,” Trump reflected.

Addressing his infamous past remarks about Machado, Trump defended himself against allegations of misogyny, asserting that Machado was challenging to work with during her tenure as Miss Universe. He contended that his statements were taken out of context and misrepresented, arguing that it was essential to put the narrative into the wider context of his experiences managing contestants. “She was tough, and she had a lot of issues during her reign. I simply spoke the truth,” Trump stated emphatically.

While the fallout from the debate continues, the discussions surrounding Holt’s moderation and the topics raised during the forum reflect the deep divisions that characterize this political season. As both sides prepare for the next stages of their campaigns, it remains to be seen how these debates and the issues raised therein will influence voter perceptions leading up to the election. 

As Trump and his team dissect the events of the debate, their focus appears to be on rallying support around the notion that mainstream media and debate moderators are not only critical of Trump but also protective of Clinton, attempting to shield her from scrutiny over her past actions. The persistence of these themes in Trump's rhetoric may galvanize his supporters while also garnering criticism from those who argue that such attitudes reflect a refusal to engage with legitimate questions about his record and behavior.

In conclusion, Trump’s critique of Lester Holt and the broader implications for the Trump campaign highlight the continual interplay between candidates and the media in shaping electoral narratives. As both Trump and Clinton press on in their respective campaigns, the debates serve as pivotal moments that could sway undecided voters or reinforce existing loyalties.",-41.0,-25.0,1119.0,-1.025,-0.03663985701519214,911.0,-0.7575757575757576,-0.027442371020856202

In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.

Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.

From the Daily Mail:

National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.

A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.

On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street.

After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.

A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has plunged into chaos for the second consecutive night as violent protests erupted in response to the fatal police shooting of 43-year-old armed suspect Keith Lamont Scott. The unrest prompted Governor Roy Cooper to declare a state of emergency, aimed at restoring order as tensions ran high across the city.

The protests, ignited by the anger over the circumstances surrounding Scott’s death, have seen a tragic escalation, with reports indicating that one protester sustained critical injuries after being shot in the head by another demonstrator. The individual is currently on life support, raising serious concerns regarding the safety and direction of the protests.

In addition to this grave incident, several more injuries have been reported. Three additional protesters and four police officers have been hospitalized, underscoring the severity of the confrontations between law enforcement and demonstrators. The situation has led to alarming confrontations not only between police and protesters but also sparked violence against members of the media. A CNN correspondent was body-slammed live on the air while covering the protests, marking a disturbing trend of aggression aimed at journalists.

The unrest has brought significant property damage, as businesses across Charlotte have been vandalized. Notably, the NASCAR Hall of Fame suffered damage amid broader reports of looting and vandalism in the area. The visuals of smashed windows and vandalized storefronts reflect the chaotic atmosphere characterizing the protests.

To counteract the surge in violence, the National Guard has been deployed to assist local law enforcement agencies. Their presence signifies the escalating concerns regarding public safety and the requirement for organized support to maintain order. In light of the ongoing unrest, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering the implementation of a curfew, seeking to exert more control over the increasingly volatile situation.

While the protests began as a demonstration against perceived injustices by police, and many protesters express solidarity against unlawful actions by others, the violent acts have overshadowed the overall message of the demonstrations. Some members of the black community have shown support for law enforcement, highlighting a complex narrative within the protests. However, a significant majority of participants have engaged in aggressive actions, leading to outbursts of violence that have marred the initial intentions of the demonstrations.

The confrontations have intensified as demonstrators have hurled bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officials, prompting the police to deploy flash grenades and tear gas in an attempt to regain control of the situation. Such reactions have only contributed to the growing fears of escalated racial tensions, obscuring the core issues at the heart of the protests.

The chaotic scenes unfolding in Charlotte illustrate a troubling intersection of community frustration and increased violence, warranting a careful examination of both the unrest and the systemic issues fueling it. The calls for justice and accountability for the actions of law enforcement have often drowned in the tide of destruction and animosity, raising questions about how to navigate the path forward.

As Charlotte grapples with these tumultuous events, community leaders, residents, and law enforcement must engage in critical dialogues aimed at addressing the underlying grievances while prioritizing safety and restoration of peace. The violence witnessed over these two nights may serve as a catalyst for change, but only if it can be channeled into constructive conversations rather than further unrest.

In the coming days, Charlotte will be a focal point for discussions on police accountability, community trust, and the broader implications of racial tensions that any city in America must confront in pursuit of equity and justice.",-82.0,-72.0,674.0,-2.484848484848485,-0.12166172106824925,655.0,-3.0,-0.1099236641221374

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked Rouhani whether he'd rather work with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. Rouhani said, ""Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.

Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.

In an interview with Chuck Todd on MSNBC, Rouhani addressed queries about the contrasting approaches of presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump toward the landmark agreement.

Rouhani acknowledged the likelihood that U.S. candidates might leverage the nuclear deal as a campaign topic. He reiterated that the deal is an established international agreement, transcending domestic politics. 

Trump has been vocal in his criticism of the nuclear agreement, describing it as a ""bad deal"" and expressing intentions to abandon it if elected. Conversely, Clinton has signaled her commitment to respecting the deal while advocating for a cautious approach in dealings with Iran. She has proposed a strategy characterized by the mantra ""distrust and verify,"" indicating an effort to maintain oversight of Iran's nuclear activities.

In light of these political dynamics, Rouhani remarked that calls from certain sectors for renegotiation of the nuclear agreement are politically motivated.

Real_28-Webpage,“How Can we LEAD When we Can’t Even Control Our Own Cities?” [VIDEO] – Eagle Rising,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said:

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.

“Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.

“Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?

“We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.

“Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.

“The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.

“There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.

“Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.”

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – In a recent address that addressed the current wave of national unrest following officer-involved shootings, former President Donald Trump emphasized the urgent need for unity across the United States. Speaking to a gathered audience, he expressed concern for the divisions that have surfaced in society and urged Americans to come together, transcending differences in background and ideology for the common good.

During his speech, Trump described the nation as ""wounded,"" acknowledging the profound problems that have led to unrest and turmoil. He underscored the impact of these issues on America's image across the globe, suggesting that the ongoing discord is not only a domestic concern but one that is being closely observed by the international community.

""Restoring unity is imperative,"" Trump stated firmly, making it clear that he believes cooperation among all Americans is essential to overcome the challenges faced today. He called for a collective effort to heal the divisions that have left many feeling increasingly isolated and vulnerable.

While Trump affirmed the right to peaceful assembly, he was unequivocal in his condemnation of violence and disruption. He made it clear that violent actions only exacerbate societal problems and discourage the very spirit of peaceful activism that many seek to support. ""All Americans deserve to live in safe communities,"" he asserted, while highlighting his determination to put an end to violence that impacts both citizens and law enforcement officers alike.

The former president took particular note of the impact of civil unrest on law-abiding African-American residents, stating that they are disproportionately affected by riots and civil disturbances. ""These events threaten their livelihoods, housing, and educational opportunities,"" he remarked, indicating that the consequences of unrest extend far beyond the immediate situations and deeply affect the fabric of communities.

Trump's address also touched on the importance of respecting the American flag and the shared values that embody the nation. He urged citizens to remember the principles that unite them, which he believes are crucial for fostering a safe and supportive environment for families. In light of the concerns surrounding violence, he highlighted the necessity of prioritizing the safety and well-being of families, particularly those of African-American parents who are raising children in environments that have been affected by unrest.

As he concluded his remarks, Trump made it clear that if he were to return to the presidency, a central tenet of his administration would be the unwavering intolerance of crime and violence. He pledged to focus on protecting vulnerable communities and ensuring that all citizens feel secure in their neighborhoods, emphasizing that a safe environment is paramount for fostering positive growth and opportunities for future generations.

Trump's passionate remarks in Pittsburgh resonate with a growing call for healing and cooperation during a time marked by tension and strife. While his focus on unity and respect for American values may find both support and criticism, his message stands as a reminder of the complexities facing the nation and the shared responsibility every American holds in addressing these challenges.",-5.0,3.0,540.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.009259259259259259,566.0,0.16666666666666666,0.00530035335689046
Real_29-Webpage,9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him,"""Donald, you’re a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him

Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.

That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father.

Story Continued Below

1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection

In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.”

“The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’”

2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward”

Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.”

“It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said.

3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully”

“Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said . “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.”

4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women”

Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.”

5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky”

In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.”

6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth”

Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.”

7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said

“I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said .

8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer”

Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’

And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.”

9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family

“I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.

Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.

In a surprising twist within the Republican Party, Senator Ted Cruz has officially endorsed former President Donald Trump, marking a significant change from their fraught history. The endorsement comes just two months after Cruz faced public backlash at the Republican National Convention for withholding support for Trump, which resulted in audible boos from the audience.

Cruz's endorsement is compounded by a landscape of open disparagement and criticism directed at Trump over the years. The tensions between the two politicians escalated notably after Trump launched personal attacks on Cruz's family, including his wife, Heidi. Cruz had previously speculated about the contents of Trump’s tax returns, even insinuating a possible mob connection, questioning why Trump had not made the documents public.

The senator has not shied away from using strong language when discussing Trump. On multiple occasions, he has labeled the billionaire as a ""sniveling coward,"" particularly in reaction to Trump's threats directed towards his wife. Cruz firmly articulated that family should be off-limits in political discourse, illustrating a notion that personal attacks, especially regarding loved ones, are unconscionable.

Cruz's disapproval of Trump’s character only intensified as he publicly characterized Trump as a ""big, loud New York bully."" The implication of this description underscored Cruz's belief that Trump’s behavior, particularly in terms of personal attacks, is unacceptable in the realm of politics. This characterization also found roots in Cruz's assertion that Trump is ""a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women,"" which was in direct response to Trump's derogatory comments concerning his wife.

As the rhetoric between the two intensified, Cruz also found himself dismissing Trump's more conspiracy-driven comments. When Trump claimed that Cruz’s father had connections to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz characterized these claims as ""nuts"" and ""kooky."" This incident illustrated the depths of animosity and the surreal nature of some of Trump's propositions, which Cruz had not hesitated to reject outright.

Beyond personal comments, Cruz went on to label Trump a ""pathological liar,"" emphasizing that the former president appears to lie without regard for the truth. In Cruz's view, this trend of dishonesty ran deep, as he suggested that Trump could potentially pass a lie detector test while simultaneously contradicting himself. Such observations point to Cruz’s long-standing criticisms regarding Trump's approach to honesty and integrity in political discourse.

The senator's critiques did not stop there. Cruz accused Trump of narcissism and branded him a ""serial philanderer,"" adding fuel to the fire by suggesting that Trump takes pride in discussing his infidelities openly. This characterization of Trump not only goes against conventional political decorum, which often prioritizes family values, but also serves to amplify Cruz's long-held grievances toward the former president.

Despite the endorsement, the echo of Cruz’s previous statements regarding Trump’s offensive remarks about his family seems to linger. As recently as July, Cruz expressed lasting resentment over the attacks Trump had made regarding his loved ones, remaining steadfast in his stance not to support anyone who would slander them. His initial reluctance to endorse Trump appeared to stem from a strong moral compass regarding family loyalty.

Cruz's endorsement of Trump, therefore, raises many questions within the political community. How can a politician shift from vehemently criticizing another to publicly endorsing them in such a short time frame? Many may speculate whether this endorsement signals a strategic move to unify the Republican base or a genuine change of heart following the tumultuous primary battles leading up to the convention.

In reflecting on this significant pivot, the endorsement poses risks as well as opportunities for Cruz. Engaging in support of a figure he has heavily criticized could alienate sections of his constituency who value consistency and trustworthiness from their leaders. On the other hand, aligning with Trump may invigorate his standing within a party that has increasingly rallied around the former president.

As the Republican primaries approach, Cruz's endorsement of Trump could be perceived as a crucial strategy to bolster unity among party members, even if it comes at the cost of his own principles and previous statements. Some might argue that in the world of politics, survival often necessitates difficult moral compromises, and Cruz's recent actions may reflect this complex reality.

In conclusion, Ted Cruz’s endorsement of Donald Trump marks a notable chapter in the ongoing narrative of the Republican Party, showcasing the intricacies and tensions of political alliances. The journey from discord to support encapsulates the evolving dynamics within the party, posing critical questions about loyalty, personal integrity, and the future direction of the Republican establishment. As the political landscape continues to shift, it will be pivotal to observe how this endorsement impacts Cruz's political trajectory as well as the broader implications for the party at large.",-40.0,12.0,974.0,-1.2903225806451613,-0.04106776180698152,925.0,0.35294117647058826,0.012972972972972972

These counties could play an outsize role in the election and offer an instructive example of what the political parties have accomplished. Wake County is the fourth county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties.

Washington (CNN)

Few counties could prove more decisive in this election than Wake County, North Carolina.

A historically competitive county whose fortunes are on the rise, Wake could help deliver Hillary Clinton a win in a key battleground state -- or dash her hopes for the presidency. Simply put, if Clinton performs well in the highly educated research triangle, then election night bodes well for her. If Wake County doesn't come out for Clinton, Donald Trump's path to the White House would grow much clearer.

The county is rapidly expanding, and the influx of new people and industries could reshape the race. Meanwhile, the turmoil across the state in Charlotte after a police officer shot and killed a black man could add another focal point in the election — search data from Google Trends shows Wake County's spiking interest in ""police brutality"" this week.

Keep your eye on Wake County, and take a look at the fundamentals below.

Population

Wake County is fairly representative of the country in terms of race and ethnicity, but it has a more highly educated population, bigger incomes and a better job picture than the rest of the nation.

Conversely, any signs of weak support for the Democratic nominee could bolster Donald Trump's prospects in the region.

The county is currently experiencing rapid growth, with an influx of new residents and industries potentially shifting the election dynamics. This growth not only affects the local economy but also influences voter sentiment as newcomers integrate into the community.

Additionally, recent events in Charlotte, including the police shooting of a black man, have heightened awareness and interest in critical issues such as police brutality. This local unrest may resonate with voters in Wake County, shaping their decisions at the polls.

Demographically, Wake County is notable for its diverse population, featuring a representative mix of race and ethnicity. Moreover, the county boasts higher education levels, incomes, and job prospects compared to the national average, all factors that could influence the political landscape and voter preferences.

As the election date approaches, Wake County remains a crucial focal point, with its outcomes poised to reflect the larger trends shaping the state's political environment.",14.0,15.0,293.0,1.0769230769230769,0.04778156996587031,285.0,1.25,0.05263157894736842

President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

“What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.”

“That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.

The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.

“Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”

In a notable departure from tradition, President Barack Obama donned a hat and blanket gifted by Native American leaders during the White House Tribal Nations Conference. The event, which celebrates relationships between the federal government and tribes, took an unexpected turn when Obama received the items as he took the stage to address the attendees.

As the ceremony unfolded, the president wrapped the blanket around his shoulders—a gesture of respect and acknowledgment—as a song was played in his honor. However, in a brief moment, Obama chose to remove the hat, adhering to an informal guideline regarding presidential attire that discourages unusual headgear.

This unspoken rule has its roots in a past presidential campaign, specifically linked to Michael Dukakis's infamous tank helmet incident, which became a defining moment in political imagery. Obama, aware of the sensitivities surrounding such appearances, had previously alluded to this guideline during a visit from the Naval Academy's football team in 2013, humorously cautioning against wearing anything on one’s head while in office.

Despite the hat's swift removal, the president took the opportunity to convey his gratitude for the deepening friendships he has cultivated over his presidency. Obama's acknowledgment of the significance of these relationships echoes the Administration's commitment to engaging with Native American communities and promoting mutual respect.

The unconventional moment at the conference serves not only as a reminder of the delicate balance between tradition and personal expression but also emphasizes the importance of cultural appreciation within the highest office in the nation. As the event drew to a close, the atmosphere remained one of celebration and unity, reflective of the lasting bonds formed between the president and Native American leaders.",17.0,26.0,327.0,1.4166666666666667,0.05198776758409786,321.0,2.6,0.08099688473520249

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.

“Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.”

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.”

“We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.

Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”

But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.

“I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.

As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

In a recent interview on the renowned “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton captivated audiences by underscoring the immense significance of the upcoming election, emphasizing that the decisions made at the polls could shape the United States for the next half-century. Clinton’s impassioned plea particularly focused on the importance of participation among black voters, whom she urged to actively engage in the electoral process.

Clinton stated, “Every relevant issue is at stake in this election,” further stressing that the stakes could not be higher for voters. She articulated her concerns regarding voter complacency, warning that the next 50 days leading to the election will play a critical role in determining the trajectory of the nation over the subsequent 50 years. Acknowledging the urgency of the situation, she encouraged listeners to verify their voter registration status and form an active coalition to strengthen the electorate.

This call to action came in the wake of President Barack Obama's recent appeal for voter engagement at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Obama drew attention to various pressing concerns on the ballot, indicating that the progress made over recent years hangs in the balance. His remarks aimed to galvanize voters into realizing their power and the need to exercise it at the polls.

As Clinton readies herself for her first presidential debate against Donald Trump, she anticipates facing aggressive opposition. Despite the expected intensity of the interactions, she committed to maintaining clarity in her communication, asserting that she will rise above the personal insults and derogatory remarks likely to come from her rival. Clinton’s strategy appears centered on focusing on the issues rather than getting embroiled in partisan jabs.

During her interview, Clinton condemned Trump’s history of derogatory comments directed toward various groups, labeled his attitude as intolerable, and affirmed her commitment to fostering an inclusive and respectful dialogue. She maintained that such behavior has no place in public discourse, especially during a critical election that could determine the moral and ethical direction of the country.

The day following her remarks, Trump took to Twitter to mock Clinton for taking what he termed a ""day off"" in preparation for their upcoming debate. This only adds fuel to the fire, highlighting the contentious atmosphere of this election campaign.

With the election quickly approaching, Clinton’s interview served as both a rallying cry for voters and a glimpse into her anticipated confrontations with Trump. It reflects a broader narrative that encapsulates the urgency for all voters, particularly in marginalized communities, to realize their power and the significance of their choices in this pivotal moment in American history.

As both candidates gear up for the debates, the focus will undoubtedly remain on the issues outlined by Obama and Clinton, as voters prepare to make decisions that will impact generations to come. The commitment to civic engagement and the fight against complacency promises to be at the forefront of the electoral conversation in the coming weeks.",7.0,14.0,524.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013358778625954198,560.0,0.7368421052631579,0.025

Story Continued Below

So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.

Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.

Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as “another Hitler.” She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.

In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.

That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.

It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin’s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did—an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing Russians,” a doubly illegal act of war.

Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.

***

John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, “Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.” Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.

But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.” Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.”

Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.

“Our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.”

He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. “All this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.”

John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.

The legacy of JFK & RFK is “being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party.”

Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.

Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.

Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.

Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime “existential” threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be “existential” enemy.

There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.

Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.”

Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.

But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.

For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.

And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.

***

So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.

We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.

President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future.

Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.

But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.

Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.

Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “There can be no business as usual with Russia.”

Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.

And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:

Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.

Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.

Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.

This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.

Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.

Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.

Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

In a startling turn of events, a former lifelong Democrat and dedicated public servant has come forward with a bold declaration: a plan to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. This endorsement, coming from someone who once served under Presidents John and Robert Kennedy, is not merely a change in allegiance; it embodies decades of political evolution, personal reflection, and deep concern for the direction of both the party and the nation.

The author’s political journey began amid the hopeful idealism of the 1960s, where Democratic values were synonymous with progress, peace, and social justice. In this era, they became actively involved in Robert Kennedy's Senate campaign. The enthusiasm for change and the promise of a brighter future resonated with many Americans and propelled the country into a transformative decade. That passion only intensified when they joined the presidential campaign of Robert Kennedy, a venture that tragically ended with his assassination in June 1968. This moment marked not only a personal loss for the author but highlighted a national tragedy that profoundly impacted the political landscape.

Years later, despite their deep-rooted loyalty to the Democratic Party, the author faced a challenging political climate. They ran on a Democratic ticket in the 1970 New York state elections but ultimately did not secure victory. This experience, however, did not deter their commitment to advocating for the values they believed in and hoped to see realized in the Democratic platform.

Fast forward to today, the author finds themselves increasingly disillusioned with the current state of the Democratic Party. It has become a party that they now describe as the ""Party of War"", undermining the peace efforts championed by the Kennedys, whom they once revered. They express the belief that the party’s focus has shifted away from diplomacy and conflict resolution to military intervention and geopolitical maneuvering.

Under recent Democratic leadership, specifically referencing figures like Hillary Clinton, the author critiques the propensity for military interventions that have characterized the party’s approach. They argue that these actions have not only exacerbated global tensions but have also had detrimental consequences for the United States domestically. The author expresses alarm over the impact of ongoing conflicts and military engagements – how they have rippled through communities and transformed the landscape of American society.

Amidst this backdrop of disillusionment, the author has found an unexpected ally in Donald Trump. They praise Trump's advocacy for diplomacy, particularly his efforts to seek cooperation with Russia in the fight against terrorism. In a landscape often dominated by rhetoric leaning towards aggression, the author sees in Trump a willingness to challenge the war-centric establishment that has become synonymous with the Democratic Party in recent years.

Despite acknowledging the flaws within Trump’s character and administration, the author emphasizes his determination to disrupt the status quo that perpetuates unnecessary wars. They argue that it is high time for the country to reassess its priorities, calling for an end to perpetual military engagements and a renewed focus on fostering peace and security within the United States. 

In advocating for a strategic redirection, the author emphasizes the need for improved support and training for police forces to effectively address the growing violence and other societal issues facing American communities. They contend that a strong domestic foundation is crucial for sustaining peace and stability, while also recognizing that a nation embroiled in conflict externally can at times find itself vulnerable internally.

As the writer delves deeper into their reasoning, they urge citizens to rally around the founding principles of the country, advocating for a collective movement away from the escalation of a new Cold War. In doing so, they invoke a sense of nostalgia for the wisdom of America’s founding values, which they believe should guide present and future policymakers.

In conclusion, the author posits that Trump’s platform resonates with the sentiments and ideals that once defined their commitment to the Democratic Party. They argue that his vision for America aligns with the preservation of national interests and the promotion of peace for future generations. In a time of significant political division and unrest, this endorsement from a former stalwart of the Democratic Party serves not just as a personal choice but as a clarion call for a return to principles that prioritize diplomacy, peace, and the well-being of the American people.",-120.0,36.0,3840.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.03125,821.0,1.2857142857142858,0.0438489646772229

As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.

Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.

From the Independent Review Journal:

But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:

People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight.

In a poignant display of solidarity and faith, North Carolina State Troopers took to one knee in Charlotte to pray before addressing a gathering of protesters. This moment contrasted starkly with the protest movement begun by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick against police prejudice, offering a different narrative focused on community and spirituality.

The photo of the officers praying quickly went viral after being shared by the North Carolina Troopers Association, which emphasized their commitment to faith as a cornerstone of their approach to recent events surrounding civil unrest. This display of unity comes on the heels of a series of protests that erupted in Charlotte and other cities following the tragic officer-involved shooting that led to the death of Keith Lamont Scott. In a city grappling with heightened tensions, the image of troopers kneeling in prayer resonated with many who seek peace in the face of turmoil.

While chaos unfolded in parts of the city due to the presence of radicals bused in to incite unrest, local citizens rallied together in prayer, hoping for a harmonious resolution between law enforcement and demonstrators. The North Carolina Troopers Association's sharing of the praying officers' photo was not just a call for community support but also a rallying point for those in the community seeking to bridge divides rather than exacerbate them.

Different regions across the country witnessed individuals taking a knee in solidarity with the troopers, further reinforcing the importance of faith over division along racial lines. This signal of unity comes amidst a climate where some protests have turned violent, fostering an atmosphere of distrust and fear. The actions of the troopers, however, have drawn a sharp contrast to those labeled as “useful idiots” – individuals supporting radical ideologies that often promote chaos rather than constructive dialogue.

The article's author expressed pride in the police officers’ commitment to prioritizing prayer and community support over violence. This notion offers a glimpse into a path forward in the turmoil that has gripped not just Charlotte, but various cities nationwide. Interventions grounded in spirituality and community dialogue are presented as foundational elements that can help mend the rifts opened by polarizing protests.

Further underlining this call for unity through faith, the presence of Billy Graham’s Rapid Response Team was noted. Their involvement exemplifies the broader commitment to healing and reconciliation, offering support to those grappling with the fallout from civil disorder. This aligns with the message that, despite the chaos fomented by radical elements, many citizens and law enforcement still aspire to foster understanding and respect.

In these tense times, officers participating in prayer signal a dedicated effort to engage with their communities in a meaningful way, prioritizing connection and compassion. As discussions continue surrounding the complexities of policing and racial relations, initiatives focused on faith and community support present a hopeful counter-narrative. The image of law enforcement seeking divine guidance in prayer not only reflects the officers’ priorities but also encourages a broader movement towards unity and healing among all citizens.

As protests persist and debates rage on, the thoughtful actions of law enforcement in Charlotte serve as a reminder that communities can endeavor for peace, striving towards a shared vision rooted in compassion rather than discord. The hope remains that faith can bridge divides, allowing for fruitful conversations and lasting changes that promote understanding across different communities.",3.0,29.0,580.0,0.1,0.005172413793103448,622.0,1.380952380952381,0.04662379421221865

The two scuffled afterward, and the protester was taken to a hospital for stitches

(CNN) Kevin Johnson -- the NBA star-turned-Sacramento mayor -- was pied in the face by a man at a charity dinner Wednesday night at the high school he once attended.

Real_35-Webpage,Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games.

Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.

Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.

""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.

While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.

During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!""

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

The incident occurred during a game against the Netherlands on September 18, where Rapinoe chose to take a knee in protest of ongoing injustice and oppression prevalent in the United States.

This act of defiance aligns Rapinoe with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who sparked a national conversation about police brutality and racial prejudice when he began the kneeling movement several years ago. Rapinoe’s solidarity with Kaepernick was apparent as she took a stance during an event meant to honor the nation.

In a response to her actions, U.S. Soccer expressed their discontent, emphasizing the organization’s expectation for players and coaches to stand at attention during the national anthem. They indicated that Rapinoe’s protest stands in direct contradiction to the values they uphold, asserting the importance of honoring the flag during such ceremonial occasions.

While no immediate punishment has been enforced against Rapinoe, U.S. Soccer has made it clear that her situation will be reevaluated should she choose to continue her kneeling protest in future games. The organization’s stance has stirred a range of reactions among fans and supporters, with some attending the match vocally expressing their objections. One spectator was notably heard urging Rapinoe to ""Stand up!"" underscoring the divide in public opinion regarding her protest.

Despite the backlash, Rapinoe remains steadfast in her commitment to advocacy. She has articulated that she is willing to face potential suspension to uphold her beliefs and continue drawing attention to important social issues. Her determination reflects a broader movement within professional sports where athletes are increasingly using their platforms to address societal challenges.

As the national dialogue surrounding race, justice, and athletes' roles in activism continues to evolve, Rapinoe’s actions serve as a critical example of the intersections between sports and political issues. The spotlight remains on her, as her next steps could have significant implications for both her career and the ongoing conversation about athletes speaking out on social justice matters. U.S. Soccer’s ultimate decision on her future participation in such protests will likely serve as a defining moment in this evolving narrative within American sports.",0.0,10.0,421.0,0.0,0.0,417.0,0.625,0.023980815347721823

It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed.

Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing.

Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.

Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.”

Below is the offending post:

“I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??”

After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.

Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people.

In a recent social media uproar, Brody Jenner, the son of Caitlyn Jenner and Linda Thompson, ignited fierce debate on Twitter as he shared his views on police shootings, drawing both support and significant backlash from various corners of the internet.

Jenner took to Instagram to express his thoughts, asserting that not every incident involving law enforcement is rooted in race. He stated, “All Lives Matter,” a phrase that has become a focal point of contention in discussions about racial justice and police reform. His comments quickly garnered criticism from a variety of users who labeled him a ""terrible person,"" primarily highlighting his identity as a white, male, straight, and cis-gender individual as a factor in their condemnations.

At the heart of Jenner's post was a call to adhere to police directives, which he argued should be universal regardless of a person's race. He posited that compliance with authorities is crucial and questioned the rationale behind exiting a vehicle while armed, emphasizing that individuals should clearly demonstrate their lack of weapons to law enforcement officers to avoid potential escalations.

However, his comments did not sit well with many, and the backlash was swift. Critics argued that Jenner’s privileged status insulated him from the realities faced by marginalized communities, and they condemned him for seemingly overlooking systemic issues related to race and policing. The response from various commentators underscored the ongoing national discourse around race relations and police interactions, with many asserting that Jenner’s perspective reflects a broader misunderstanding of these complex issues.

In an attempt to clarify his statements, Jenner posted again on Instagram after receiving the negative feedback. This follow-up post, however, only fanned the flames of liberal outrage. Critics felt that instead of fostering constructive dialogue, he doubled down on sentiments that many found tone-deaf or dismissive of genuine concerns surrounding police brutality and racial inequity.

The public discourse surrounding Jenner's comments exposes the chasm in perceptions of race and policing in America. Advocates for police reform argue that a deeper understanding of the socio-political context is imperative, contending that emphasizing ""all lives"" without addressing the particular struggles faced by Black and marginalized individuals can perpetuate a lack of accountability and change within law enforcement systems.

As discussions continue, Jenner's posts have certainly struck a nerve, reflecting the broader societal tensions that remain prevalent in contemporary conversations about race, policing, and justice in the United States. The reactions to his statements highlight the complexities and sensitivities involved in these discussions, illustrating just how divided opinions can be concerning issues of race and authority.",-17.0,-15.0,476.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.03571428571428571,496.0,-0.9375,-0.03024193548387097

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.”

Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past.

Story Continued Below

“Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.”

The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].”

Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.”

“I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”

In an emotional declaration, Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has taken strong aim at Donald Trump for his refusal to apologize for his promotion of the controversial “birther” movement targeting former President Barack Obama. Speaking in public forums following her visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, Brazile articulated the deep pain and emotional scars that such divisive rhetoric inflicts on the American populace.

Brazile’s comments labeled Trump’s actions as a “wound that won’t heal,” evoking a sense of historical pain that many Americans carry concerning race and identity in the United States. With her personal reflections shaped by visits to the museum, she conveyed the collective historical struggles endured by African Americans, particularly when it comes to issues related to documentation and identity.

During her remarks, Brazile did not mince words about her feelings toward Trump’s persistent questioning of Obama’s birthplace. She stated firmly, “He should feel ashamed.” Her condemnation highlighted a broader narrative within the African American community, where the implications of questioning the legitimacy of the first black president are felt as not just a political maneuver, but a profound affront to dignity and historical truth.

In a recent presidential debate, Trump shifted the blame for the birther movement away from himself, implicating Hillary Clinton instead, while simultaneously claiming credit for the eventual release of Obama’s birth certificate. This attempt at deflection, according to Brazile, only serves to exacerbate the historical wounds associated with the issue. She expressed deep skepticism about the possibility of Trump ever offering the apology she believes is necessary to heal the rift his statements have created.

Brazile’s critique extends to the broader discourse surrounding race in America, emphasizing that the ongoing exploitation of racial pain for political gain not only distracts from critical discussions but also perpetuates a cycle of trauma that affects generations. She believes the continual reference to the “birther” issue perpetuates harmful narratives that undermine the progress toward equality and dignity for all Americans.

The significance of Brazile’s statements is underscored by her personal connection to America’s racial history, as she shared the story of her own family's experiences and struggles for recognition and respect. The museum visit served as a poignant backdrop for her arguments, drawing on the rich history of African Americans who have fought against similar forms of division and exclusion.

As calls for accountability and healing contend within the political arena, Brazile stands firm in her belief that the country must grapple with its past to create a more inclusive future. She articulated a vision of a nation that should not just acknowledge its historical wounds but actively work to heal them through sincere dialogue and understanding.

In a landscape often characterized by partisanship, Brazile's comments resonate with many who seek a more compassionate and unified America. By demanding an acknowledgment of historical grievances, she invites citizens to reflect on the collective responsibilities that come with leadership and the importance of fostering an environment of respect and dignity for all. 

As the debate over race, identity, and leadership continues, Brazile’s remarks remind us that the shadows of the past persist, and it is only through honest engagement that the nation can hope to transcend its enduring challenges.",-17.0,-1.0,540.0,-1.0,-0.03148148148148148,634.0,-0.05555555555555555,-0.0015772870662460567
Real_38-Webpage,US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike,"(CNN) The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.

Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials.

That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.

Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.

But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

The incident, which involved aircraft from the US, UK, Denmark, and Australia, has raised serious concerns about identification protocols in military operations. US military officials indicated that the targeted personnel might have been Syrian military prisoners, as they were not wearing military uniforms or carrying standard military weapons at the time of the strike.

The UK Ministry of Defence confirmed that drones were utilized in the attack, contributing to the confusion surrounding the identity of those struck.

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

“This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.”

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

“If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.”

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

“That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.”

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

At this year’s Emmy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel took the opportunity to both entertain and critique, channeling his comedic prowess to target former President Donald Trump. Opening the evening with a series of laughs, Kimmel made sharp observations about Hollywood's elite and the increasing diversity among nominees, proclaiming, “This year, the nominees are the most diverse ever.” 

In a moment of sarcasm that brought laughter from the audience, Kimmel remarked, “The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.” The quip highlighted the significant strides in representation within the industry, a point of pride for the attendees and the show itself.

However, Kimmel didn’t shy away from addressing the elephant in the room—Trump’s controversial ascent to the presidency. With characteristic wit, he suggested that if it weren't for television, Trump may never have made it to the political spotlight. He humorously painted a vivid picture, speculating that the former president might be at home “rubbing up against his wife Malaria,” a play on the pronunciation of Melania that drew eyebrow raises and chuckles from the audience.

Kimmel placed part of the blame for Trump’s rise on television producer Mark Burnett, best known for creating “Celebrity Apprentice.” Kimmel’s comedic critique was harsh yet lighthearted, as he wittily proposed that Burnett should be the first person tossed over Trump’s wall—an allusion to the former president's infamous campaign promise of building a wall—if he were to secure enough votes against his own self-interests.

The highlight of the night was undoubtedly Kimmel’s monologue, which included a pre-recorded video segment showcasing his sharp-tongued humor and timely observations about politics and pop culture. His clever blend of humor and pointed critique resonated with the audience, ensuring that the evening was packed not only with glamour and awards but also a healthy dose of political commentary. 

As the Emmys wrapped up, Kimmel's remarks lingered in the air, reminding all that while celebration is a key element of the night, the world of entertainment is deeply intertwined with the nation’s political landscape.",13.0,23.0,391.0,0.7222222222222222,0.03324808184143223,420.0,2.5555555555555554,0.05476190476190476

Real_41-Webpage,Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business',"During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump’s debate performance Monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.""

Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""

""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'You’re fired.' They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.""

During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way.""

""When you’re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump.

The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart.""

""He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.

""If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord,"" Biden said about the debate. ""What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.""",http://abcn.ws/2d3YEVr,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"Abc News,More Arlette",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382,"{""fb_title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""description"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@arlettesaenz"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:43:23"", ""keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate""}","- During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's debate performance, especially regarding comments on the housing crisis.

During a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden took the opportunity to criticize former President Donald Trump's comments made during a debate, particularly regarding the ongoing housing crisis in the United States. Biden expressed disbelief at Trump’s assertion that it was good business to see the housing market fail, reflecting a stark moral disconnect that Biden believes undermines the fundamental values shared by the majority of American politicians.

Biden reflected on the principles upheld by past presidents, including those from the Republican Party, contrasting them sharply with Trump’s current rhetoric. ""Would Ronald Reagan ever suggest that it was good business to exploit people's misery?"" Biden questioned, highlighting what he perceives as a significant deviation from the ethical standards historically embraced by leaders in both parties.

The Vice President underscored that Trump lacks the essential sensibilities that most politicians, regardless of party affiliation, tend to share. His critique extended to a statement made by Hillary Clinton during the debate, wherein she accused Trump of effectively rooting for a collapse in the housing market. In response, Trump referred to it simply as ""business,"" a characterization that Biden took issue with, suggesting it revealed a troubling moral vacuum.

Further emphasizing his point, Biden highlighted Trump's wealth and questioned the former president's genuine concern for the economic struggles faced by average Americans. He pointed out the vast disparity between Trump’s financial standing and the reality of working Americans who often face daily hardships. Additionally, Biden criticized Trump’s remarks regarding his own tax contributions, suggesting that such statements were an attempt to portray intelligence while disregarding the frustrations of those who dutifully pay taxes.

Biden articulated that Trump’s views epitomize a cynical approach to the American populace, suggesting a broader ideological chasm that could significantly influence the upcoming election. He stressed the necessity for voters to have clear choices, warning against the implications of aligning with someone who, in his view, disregards the struggles of ordinary citizens.

In closing, Biden’s remarks in Philadelphia served as a pointed condemnation of Trump's approach to the housing crisis, presenting a contrasting vision for leadership that prioritizes the welfare of the American people. As the election campaign continues, Biden's criticisms underscore the stark differences in perspectives on fundamental economic issues, urging voters to consider the moral implications of their choices at the ballot box.",-5.0,-29.0,453.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.011037527593818985,466.0,-1.9333333333333333,-0.06223175965665236
Real_42-Webpage,National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6,"Story highlights Hillary Clinton has a 6-point lead over Donald Trump in a four way race, according to a new poll

Clinton has the edge over Trump on a number of key issues in the poll ahead of the first presidential debate

(CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.

The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.

Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.

Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.

Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament.

Real_43-Webpage,“Public School Forced My Child To,"7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

“Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.”

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

“During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.”

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

“Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.”

It referenced the jihad as,

“a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years.

A federal lawsuit has been filed against La Plata High School in Maryland, alleging that the institution engages in indoctrinating students with Islamic teachings. The complaint has been lodged by John and Melissa Wood, represented by the Thomas More Law Center, which specializes in religious freedom cases. 

The lawsuit claims that students were required to profess the Islamic statement of faith, known as the Shahada, memorize the five pillars of Islam, and be taught that Islam is superior to Christianity and Judaism. According to the Woods, these actions violate the principles of religious freedom and the rights of students from diverse faith backgrounds. 

John Wood, one of the plaintiffs, asserts that he was banned from the school after he raised concerns about the Islamic teachings being enforced on students. Richard Thompson, President of the Thomas More Law Center, has echoed these sentiments by accusing school officials of compelling Wood's daughter to denounce her Christian faith. 

The legal documents further argue that the recitation of the Shahada constituted a form of conversion for non-Muslim students and posed questions about the constitutionality of the practices being enacted within the school. The Woods contend that the school's curriculum inadequately covered Christianity and included disparaging remarks about the faith, thus indicating a promotion of Islam over Christianity that they claim is unconstitutional.

Specific materials allegedly taught in the classroom suggest that most Muslims possess a stronger faith than average Christians, while also describing Islam as a peaceful religion. The legal challenge notes that a handout provided to students claimed that the Koran does not support martyrdom through suicide bombings, presenting a perspective on jihad that differs from widely held interpretations.

The reported incidents described in the lawsuit are said to have occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. In light of the serious accusations, officials from the Charles County Public Schools have not yet commented on the lawsuit, stating they have not officially received any documentation regarding the complaint lodged against the school.

The lawsuit has named specific individuals within the school's administration, including Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and the Charles County Board of Education. As the case unfolds, it is likely to draw significant attention both locally and nationally, amid growing debates regarding educational content and religious expression in public schools.

This development raises important questions about the balance between teaching about diverse religions and respecting the rights of students from different faith traditions. As the legal proceedings progress, the outcome will be closely monitored by advocates on both sides of the argument, with potential implications for how religious teachings are presented in public education moving forward.",-5.0,-6.0,511.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.009784735812133072,494.0,-0.375,-0.012145748987854251

Real_47-Webpage,KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism,"“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can’t I?

Rock icon Gene Simmons, best known as the frontman of the legendary band KISS, recently made headlines with his outspoken comments regarding terrorism in the United States, particularly in the context of the NY/NJ bomber, Ahmad Khan Rahami. During an encounter at an airport, Simmons spoke candidly to TMZ about the bombings and the broader implications of Islamic terrorism.

Simmons did not hold back in his criticism, suggesting that Rahami should be incarcerated, stating that he “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” His remarks come amidst increasing concerns over domestic security in the wake of high-profile terrorism cases.

Known for his strong advocacy of free market principles and personal liberty, Simmons emphasized that combating Islamic terrorism requires effective measures, including what he termed ""smart"" racial profiling. He articulated his belief that smart profiling could help detect threats and expressed his readiness to personally experience profiling if it meant uncovering potential dangers. ""That's why the words 'too bad' exist,"" he stated, addressing the complexities and ethical debates surrounding the topic of profiling.

Simmons’ take on the issue has garnered attention, highlighting his willingness to engage in controversial subjects that intersect with security and civil liberties. Amid discussions of potential policy changes, a humorous suggestion has emerged within the public discourse about Simmons possibly taking on the role of director of Homeland Security should Donald Trump be elected to office. While this notion was presented in jest, it underscores the rock star's larger-than-life persona.

The opinions shared by Simmons reflect a personal stance and do not necessarily align with the viewpoints of EagleRising.com or its representation of the community’s discourse on these pressing national issues. As the conversation about balancing personal freedoms with national security continues, figures like Simmons play a unique role in shaping public awareness and discussion, showcasing the diverse perspectives that shape such complex topics.",12.0,18.0,381.0,0.5714285714285714,0.031496062992125984,361.0,1.6363636363636365,0.04986149584487535
Real_48-Webpage,"Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'","(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""

""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""

Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.

Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.

Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.

""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""

""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""

""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""

Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016

In response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.

Danny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.",http://cnn.it/2cQyS4N,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,"Dan Merica,Eugene Scott",http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161118161709-cop-punches-woman-in-face-thumb-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718110446-02-officer-mohamed-noor-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717224427-justine-ruszczyk-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170711043320-georgia-police-beating-jnd-orig-vstop-00000612-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170104090632-north-carolina-school-body-slam-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170720014308-baltimore-pd-body-cam-video-release-02-large-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170626185531-jordan-edwards-roy-oliver-split-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712182221-florida-state-attorney-aramis-ayala-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170818111936-dashcam-video-ohio-violent-arrest-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160707080401-philando-castile-facebook-2-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520225617-georgia-man-tased-death-police-pkg-00012201-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717113139-australian-woman-minneapolis-police-shooting-nr-00000812-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718090944-betsy-hodges-7-18-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712054244-louisiana-couple-police-shooting-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160428084627-baltimore-teen-replica-gun-shot-dnt-00001823-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html,"{""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""author"": ""Eugene Scott and Dan Merica, CNN"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-col,col-controversial-police-incidents-"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Election 2016, US election, Tulsa, shooting, politics, Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable' - CNNPolitics"", ""article"": {""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202""}, ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-21T14:20:33Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced plans to address police-involved shootings.

In a significant move to confront ongoing concerns surrounding police-involved shootings, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced a comprehensive strategy aimed at tackling the systemic issues that have come to the forefront following recent violent incidents. During a press conference, Mook outlined a two-pronged approach that seeks to implement national standards for police training and foster improved relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

Mook emphasized that the Clinton campaign believes in establishing national best practices rather than relying solely on the varying policies enforced at the local level. This strategic direction comes in the wake of recent high-profile shootings that have reignited the national conversation about race, justice, and policing. Specifically, the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man in Tulsa, and the unrest following the death of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte have underscored the urgent need for reform.

""We recognize that the responsibility to create a safer environment lies not only with law enforcement but also within the communities they protect,"" Mook stated. He highlighted the critical role of community policing as a means to rebuild trust and restore relationships between law enforcement and minority communities, which have often felt the harsh effects of police violence.

Clinton, addressing the issues more broadly, condemned the systematic racism that permeates the justice system. ""We cannot turn a blind eye to the reality that individuals are treated unequally based on their ethnicity,"" she said, directly referencing the implicit bias that disproportionately affects people of color. This acknowledgment reflects a growing awareness within the political sphere about the need for urgent change in how policing is conducted in communities of color.

With the public deeply shaken by the recent events in Tulsa and Charlotte, the Clinton campaign signaled a clear and powerful message: the time for systemic change is now. Clinton expressed her frustration with the repeated instances of police violence against unarmed black individuals and asserted that more needs to be done to prevent such tragedies in the future. ""This is not just an issue for local jurisdictions. It is a national crisis that calls for soul-searching across our country,"" she added. 

On the subject of law enforcement personnel, Clinton was careful to recognize the presence of ""good, honorable"" police officers who work tirelessly to protect their neighborhoods. However, she reiterated the necessity for improvements in training and accountability within police departments nationwide. “It's important we support those officers who embody the values of service and protection, while also confronting a system that too often allows for misconduct,” Clinton asserted.

The announcement comes amid ongoing investigations by the Department of Justice and state authorities into the shooting of Terence Crutcher. These investigations will assess potential civil rights violations in the case, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability within law enforcement agencies.

In the wake of the turmoil in Charlotte following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, where approximately twelve police officers sustained injuries during protests, Mook reiterated the urgency of reform. ""We must stand against the violence that arises from these tragic incidents and focus on initiatives that bridge divides,"" he urged.

As the Clinton campaign moves forward with its proposed changes, it appears poised to seize upon a moment in which many Americans are calling for dramatic shifts in how policing occurs in their communities. The two-pronged approach articulated by Mook—involving enhanced training standards and a commitment to repairing community-police relations—stands as a testament to the campaign's responsiveness to the growing frustrations and demands of the electorate.

In conclusion, as the 2016 presidential race continues to unfold, Clinton's campaign appears dedicated to not only addressing the complexities of police violence and systemic racism but also ensuring a brighter future for all communities. By acknowledging the multifaceted issues at hand and advocating for tangible solutions, the campaign aims to resonate with voters who are deeply concerned about social justice and law enforcement accountability. The path ahead may be challenging, but the message is clear: action must be taken to safeguard the rights and lives of all individuals, particularly those who have long suffered under the weight of inequality within the justice system.",-5.0,-18.0,656.0,-0.14705882352941177,-0.007621951219512195,781.0,-0.6923076923076923,-0.023047375160051217

Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager.

Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative.

Story Continued Below

“He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?”

Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.

Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.”

“So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked.

“You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.

As the high-stakes debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton approaches, anticipation builds around Trump's stance on the Islamic State. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has affirmed that Trump will articulate his specific plan to combat ISIS during the debate, should the topic arise.

Conway emphasized that Trump's approach goes beyond his widely recognized statement to ""knock the hell out of ISIS,"" revealing that he has formulated a more detailed strategy. Despite public interest in understanding Trump's plan, Conway noted that the campaign aims to maintain a level of discretion—effectively avoiding ""tipping his hand"" to the enemy.

Surprisingly, Conway expressed skepticism regarding Clinton's decision to publish her own plan on her campaign website, questioning if ""ISIS can't read that plan."" This critique underlines Trump's campaign strategy to ensure operational details remain confidential, thus preventing potential adversaries from gaining insights into their methods for combating terrorism.

When the issue of voters seeking more transparency was raised, Conway reassured the public that Trump would indeed elaborate on his viewpoint regarding the defeat of ISIS. However, she stressed the importance of keeping operational specifics under wraps, ensuring that no valuable information is available to extremist groups.

By balancing the need for clarity to the electorate while safeguarding crucial details from enemy forces, Trump aims to present himself as a decisive figure ready to confront one of the most pressing security challenges of our time. As the debate nears, voters await Trump's insights, looking for a robust framework that addresses their concerns regarding national security without compromising strategic advantages.",-11.0,-5.0,331.0,-1.1,-0.03323262839879154,308.0,-0.5,-0.016233766233766232

Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists.

During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear.

""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.""

""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens.

New York, NY – President Barack Obama reaffirmed the United States' commitment to combating ISIS and addressing security concerns in the wake of recent attempts at mass violence. Speaking during a pivotal moment at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting, Obama sought to calm the fears of Americans who have been rattled by the events of the past few days.

In a speech delivered from a hotel in Manhattan, the President praised law enforcement agencies for their swift and effective response to bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey. He lauded their efforts in apprehending suspects and maintaining public safety, underscoring the critical role they play in the face of threats.

Obama pointed out that yielding to fear only serves to benefit terrorists, who aim to disrupt daily life and undermine the core values that Americans hold dear. ""We cannot let fear dictate our actions,"" he stated, encouraging the nation to remain vigilant and steadfast in their daily lives.

Highlighting the resilience and toughness of residents in New York and New Jersey, Obama called on all citizens to draw inspiration from their strength. He expressed pride in the character demonstrated by Americans during such trying times, emphasizing that the nation’s strength lies in its collective resolve.

As investigations continued in Chelsea following a bomb explosion that injured dozens, the President’s remarks serve as a reminder of the importance of unity and perseverance. Obama reinforced the idea that the American spirit remains unbroken, even in the face of threats from extremist groups. 

His commitment to fighting ISIS has been unwavering, and with his address, he sought not only to reassure the public but also to inspire them to stand firm against the forces of fear and violence.",-6.0,7.0,331.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.01812688821752266,333.0,0.6363636363636364,0.021021021021021023
Real_50-Webpage,Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity,"United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.

The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.

At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.

""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.

Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""

JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45

""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.

""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""

The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.

A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.

Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.

""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""

Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.

""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.

""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.

The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.

""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement.

But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.

""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.""

The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.

The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.

""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""

Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.

""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.""

But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.

""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""

As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.

The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.

Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.

And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp.

""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said.",http://cnn.it/2deTou2,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg,Laura Koran,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920104405-02-obama-un-0920-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920152131-obama-united-nations-general-assembly-origwx-bw-00000210-exlarge-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920093742-obama-leaders-collage-edited-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html,"{""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""author"": ""Laura Koran"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,art-vid"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""politics, Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity - CNNPolitics"", ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-20T22:23:38Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- President Barack Obama urged countries to fulfill their moral obligation to address the global refugee crisis during a speech at the United Nations.

In a powerful address at the United Nations, President Barack Obama urged the international community to confront the pressing global refugee crisis, framing it as a moral obligation that transcends borders and political divides. Speaking at the Leaders' Summit on Refugees, Obama highlighted the plight of the tens of millions of displaced individuals worldwide, emphasizing the need for a collective response to what he described as a fundamental test of humanity.

The summit was convened to address what Obama called ""the defining challenge of our time."" With an estimated 65.3 million people displaced in 2015 alone—over 21.3 million of whom fled their countries as refugees—the urgency of the situation has captured global attention, reminiscent of the challenges faced during World War II. Specifically, the president pointed to the Syrian crisis, which has seen approximately 4.8 million individuals displaced, labeling the ongoing situation as ""particularly unacceptable.""

As the refugee crisis gained traction on the global stage, Obama acknowledged the political backlash against accepting refugees that has arisen in his own country. In a veiled response to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s controversial proposal to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Obama reiterated the importance of empathy and compassion. He cautioned against letting fear and division dictate national policies, stressing that the world must not turn its back on those who are fleeing violence and hardship.

While recognizing the mounting concerns of European leaders over large-scale migration, Obama noted a clear need for a more orderly system to manage refugee flows. This sentiment was echoed by Secretary of State John Kerry during the meeting, who clarified that additional urgent efforts were required to address the crisis and to ensure a unified response among nations.

The Leaders' Summit aimed to set specific targets to help alleviate the suffering of refugees. Among the goals were a 30% increase in funding for refugee support, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and improved access to education and employment opportunities for those affected by displacement. These measures, Obama asserted, are crucial in providing a lifeline to the millions in need.

However, aid organizations expressed skepticism about whether the summit would yield the concrete commitments necessary to bring about meaningful change. With a global humanitarian financing goal of an additional $3 billion being emphasized by world leaders, the pressure is mounting for significant contributions. This ambitious target underscores the need for collective financing solutions to support the millions of displaced people, particularly in light of the ongoing conflict in Syria.

In an effort to lead by example, the Obama administration revealed plans to increase the number of refugees permitted to resettle in the United States. The proposed rise from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 in 2017 marks a significant commitment. However, the president is confronted with considerable limitations, particularly stemming from a lack of support among congressional Republicans who have resisted proposals to bolster resources for refugee assistance.

As the refugee crisis continues to escalate, it is clear that Syria serves as both a focal point and a sobering reminder of the broader implications of forced displacement. Obama pointed out that the ongoing conflict has not only produced a staggering number of refugees but has also created an entire generation of individuals who have spent their formative years in refugee camps, often with little hope of stable, meaningful lives outside these temporary facilities. This adds a critical long-term dimension to the humanitarian crisis that must be addressed comprehensively.

With the Leaders' Summit on Refugees, Barack Obama has made a strong case for increased international cooperation to tackle what he considers an urgent humanitarian crisis. By framing the issue as a test of humanity, he has not only called attention to the challenges faced by millions around the world but has also challenged nations to rise above political divisions and respond with the compassion and support that those fleeing violence desperately need. 

His advocacy for increased funding, improved resettlement processes, and expanded access to education and employment for refugees aims to foster a collaborative approach to resolving the crisis. As the world grapples with this significant challenge, the call for responsibility and action rings louder than ever. The hope is that leaders from around the globe will step up to meet the occasion, ensuring that humanitarian efforts are not just a matter of policy, but a commitment to the dignity and rights of individuals regardless of where they come from.

As countries continue to navigate the intricacies of the refugee crisis, the implications for stability and security worldwide cannot be overlooked. The convergence of human rights, international relations, and economic stability paints a complex landscape where every decision made holds repercussions for both the refugees seeking safety and the nations they aspire to join. 

The ongoing discussions and outcomes from the Leaders' Summit are but the beginning of a larger journey towards addressing one of the most complex humanitarian crises of our time. Whether world leaders will rally behind the initiatives proposed or allow political narratives to dictate their responses remains uncertain, but the urgency for action is clear, as is the ethical imperative to do so. The true measure will be the responses that emerge not only in word but in action, paving the way for a future where humanitarian assistance is a priority rather than an afterthought. 

In conclusion, President Obama’s passionate appeal for international unity to tackle the refugee crisis serves as a crucial reminder of the role that compassion and collective responsibility play in the global arena. As the world stands at a crossroads, the actions taken in the coming months will determine whether the plight of millions is met with indifference or with a relentless drive for resolution and support. The outcome could define not only the lives of countless individuals but also the moral fabric of societies that are tasked with welcoming them.

The refugee crisis presents a profound test of our shared humanity, urging us to confront our fears and biases, and reminding us that in the face of adversity and suffering, our collective response will ultimately shape the world’s legacy for generations to come.",-13.0,4.0,1293.0,-0.325,-0.010054137664346482,1126.0,0.1111111111111111,0.003552397868561279
Real_51-Webpage,Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings,"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues

It's a recurring theme of his campaign

Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions.

The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law.

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.

""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

Following recent terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey, Trump labeled Clinton a ""weak and ineffective"" leader in confronting the escalating threat of radical Islamic terrorism.

Trump, who has consistently emphasized his hardline immigration policies, took aim at Clinton's approach to domestic terror suspects. He proposed trying such suspects, including U.S. citizens, as ""foreign enemy combatants,"" a move that underscores his unyielding stance on national security.

During his address, Trump accused Clinton of being more stringent toward his supporters than toward Islamist terrorists. He referenced her previous comments that labeled his supporters as part of a ""basket of deplorables,"" questioning why she has not expressed similar alarm about radical Islamic threats. He implied that Clinton's rhetoric suggests that hardworking Americans pose a greater danger than Islamic extremists.

Trump's remarks resonate with his base, as he continues to frame the debate on national security in stark terms, pitting his vision against that of Clinton. This rally is part of his broader campaign strategy, aiming to solidify support by emphasizing perceived weaknesses in his opponent's policies and reaffirming his commitment to a hardline approach on immigration and terrorism.",-16.0,-19.0,262.0,-1.7777777777777777,-0.061068702290076333,244.0,-2.111111111111111,-0.0778688524590164
Real_52-Webpage,In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism,"Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.

The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.

But the ""he said/she said"" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics.

Story Continued Below

While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?

In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.

Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.

But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.

As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both ""he said and she said""—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.

One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?

I don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.

The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.

Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.

Obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.

The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.”

Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.

The last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”

If you’re not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.

In the world of journalism, storytelling is often guided by various methodologies. One prominent approach is the ""he said/she said"" method, which involves presenting at least two sides of every story, particularly in the realm of political reporting. This method inherently contributes to the notion of journalistic objectivity, allowing readers to form their own conclusions based on diverse viewpoints presented within a narrative. However, this technique has come under fire in recent years. Criticism escalated after New York University professor Jay Rosen called out the method in 2009, asserting that it might promote false equivalences and hinder deeper analytical reporting. 

Fast forward to the present, this debate has reignited amidst a fierce political landscape, particularly following a recent article in The New York Times by journalist Michael Barbaro. In this piece, Barbaro offered a harsh critique of former President Donald Trump, provoking a broader conversation regarding the efficacy and appropriateness of the ""he said/she said"" journalistic format. Critics, such as Peter Beinart, have voiced concerns that in certain situations—like the behavior exhibited by Trump—this traditional method falls short. They argue that a more straightforward and incisive approach may be necessary to adequately address and contextualize behaviors and statements that, in their view, are damaging or deceptive.

Opponents of abandoning the ""he said/she said"" framework emphasize its fundamental role in ensuring comprehensive reporting. They contend that the dual-sided structure not only facilitates thorough exploration of various narratives but also discourages oversimplification of complex issues. Critics fear that moving away from this method could herald a decline in political journalism, fostering biases that cloud comprehensive reporting in favor of partisanship. The inherent risk is that such an approach might dilute the essence of journalistic integrity and compromise the nuanced investigation of political discourse.

The ""he said/she said"" format serves multiple practical purposes in journalistic execution. It aids in presenting a balanced view, allowing for reader inquiry. Particularly in cases where political dishonesty prevails, this method can illuminate differing perceptions of truth while maintaining an impartial tone. Critics of Trump, particularly, have pointed to instances where the former president’s statements starkly contrast with established facts. The argument for a clear rejection of falsehoods in these cases rests on the belief that boldness in reporting may be better suited to confront political realities.

Historically, journalism has been an evolving field, with minority positions often acting as catalysts for progress. Instances where dissenting views—no matter how initially misguided—were presented responsibly have enriched public discourse, driving progress in societal understanding and thought. This concept ties closely to the ongoing debate about the ""he said/she said"" method. Supporters of the format believe it adds layers to reader comprehension, allowing individuals to sift through multifaceted arguments and reach more informed conclusions.

Moreover, maintaining the ""he said/she said"" structure is arguably more significant in today’s media landscape. Here, audiences frequently engage with information that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs, creating echo chambers that risk diminishing engagement with diverse perspectives. This tendency to gravitate towards like-minded viewpoints can stifle critical discussions that are essential for a functioning democracy. By adhering to the dual-sided reporting format, journalists provide a necessary counterbalance that encourages audiences to confront opposing views.

NPR News Director Michael Oreskes has noted that executing a neutral journalistic tone can make significant strides in fostering open dialogue. By doing so, journalism becomes a platform for discussion rather than a battleground for ideological clashes. This perspective aligns with the larger argument that while the ""he said/she said"" method may not be flawless, it underpins a structure of integrity within journalism that can yield a more informed public.

In conclusion, the ""he said/she said"" journalistic format boasts a critical role in the narrative sea of political journalism. Despite recent critiques and a prosperous push for more decisive reporting methods in specific contexts, the foundation this approach establishes is vital for sustaining journalistic integrity. Maintaining such a structure is essential, not only to cover varying viewpoints but also to foster an informed electorate capable of critical thoughtfulness. Amid ongoing dialogue surrounding the best practices for political reporting, it is this dual-sided commitment to narrative that promises to nurture public discourse, lift understanding, and encourage robust conversations surrounding complex issues in an ever-evolving society. 

Ultimately, while recognizing the potential pitfalls of over-reliance on the ""he said/she said"" methodology, it is clear that articulated, balanced reporting remains indispensable in presenting a well-rounded view of political and social discourse. Dissenting opinions, however controversial, can serve to enhance our collective knowledge base and elevate the quality of journalism as it evolves in alignment with the ever-changing dynamics of public perception and political realities. This is the hallmark of responsible journalism—ensuring that every voice finds a platform and that dialogue continues to thrive in pursuit of truth and understanding.",6.0,26.0,2265.0,0.06593406593406594,0.0026490066225165563,915.0,0.7222222222222222,0.02841530054644809
Real_53-Webpage,Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. […] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”

Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has recently been thrust into the spotlight, not only for his outspoken views on law enforcement and political matters but also for his handling of critical incidents within the jail system under his command. Notably, Clarke has gained prominence through frequent appearances on Fox News, where he has voiced staunch opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, likening it to international terrorists. His support for the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been unwavering, with Clarke recently speaking in favor of Trump at the Republican National Convention held in Cleveland.

However, Clarke’s tenure has not been without its challenges. The tragic case of Terrill Thomas, a 38-year-old man who died in the Milwaukee County Jail, has led to heightened scrutiny of Clarke's leadership. Thomas was found dead on April 24, nine days after his arrest, reportedly succumbing to thirst. Inmates reported that Thomas begged for water in the days leading up to his death—a claim that has raised serious questions about the conditions within the jail. The Milwaukee County medical examiner’s office classified Thomas' death as a homicide due to profound dehydration, implicating the actions of those responsible for his care.

Investigations have revealed that Thomas' access to water was cut off for six days, even as fellow inmates alerted authorities and prison staff about his desperate situation. Attorney Erik J. Heipt has reported receiving calls from inmates raising concerns about water accessibility, echoing prior incidents, including the death of another inmate in 2011 attributed to lack of water.

In the backdrop of the current controversies, Clarke remains active in political circles, recently participating in a pro-Trump bus tour organized by a super PAC in support of the presidential candidate. The sheriff's financial interests also came into the limelight, with reports indicating that Clarke earned over $150,000 in 2015 from speaking fees, travel reimbursements, and gifts.

As Clarke continues to champion his political beliefs and remain in the public eye, the challenges facing his administration and its impact on the community will likely dominate discussions surrounding his legacy as sheriff.",-25.0,-8.0,375.0,-1.9230769230769231,-0.06666666666666667,404.0,-0.6153846153846154,-0.019801980198019802

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?”

In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

“I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

October 30, 2023

As the presidential election season gears up, the topic of fact-checking during debates has ignited passionate discussions among political analysts, journalists, and the public. Janet Brown, who serves as the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates, recently made headlines by declaring that fact-checking should not play a role in presidential debates. Her remarks raised eyebrows and stirred a heated debate about the integrity and purpose of these high-profile events.

Brown expressed doubts about the practicality of distinguishing between ""big facts"" and ""little facts,"" suggesting that fact-checking could complicate the flow of the debates. This position aligns with the recent push from Donald Trump's campaign, which has been advocating for reduced oversight on fact-checking during the debates. Such calls for leniency resonate with Trump’s long-standing approach to public discourse, wherein he frequently delivers statements that diverge from established facts.

Analysis of Trump’s statements has revealed a striking pattern of misinformation. According to reports, the former president lies approximately once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds, an unsettling statistic that raises concerns about the accuracy of information presented to the electorate. Notable examples of Trump's misstatements include inaccurate claims regarding the Iraq war and misleading assertions about crime rates, both of which have drawn significant scrutiny from fact-checkers and political commentators alike.

While Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has also been known to distort the truth on occasion, the frequency of Trump's fabrications far surpasses her missteps. This disparity in honesty has resulted in a polarized discourse around the necessity of fact-checking during debates. Advocates for transparency argue that without a check on the candidates' statements, voters are left vulnerable to rampant misinformation.

The suggestion that debates could proceed without fact-checking moderators has incited outrage among critics. Journalists and political commentators have voiced their concerns, questioning the fundamental role of moderators in upholding the integrity of the debates. The very purpose of these forums is to inform voters, and critics assert that a lack of moderation on facts goes against the democratic principles these debates are meant to embody.

Supporters of Trump, on the other hand, have embraced the possibility of unmoderated debates as an opportunity for voters to engage more critically with the material presented. They argue that individuals should take personal responsibility for fact-checking the statements made by candidates, suggesting that the electorate is capable of discerning truth from falsehood without the intervention of moderators. This perspective, however, overlooks the potential negative impact of unfiltered misinformation on an already fragmented political landscape.

The broader discussion surrounding fact-checking in presidential debates highlights deep-seated concerns about the integrity of the electoral process. As misinformation becomes increasingly prevalent in political discourse, the need for reliable, factual information has never been more critical. When candidates are allowed to speak without accountability, the stakes of these debates rise, placing an even greater burden on voters to navigate the ocean of conflicting claims.

With the election fast approaching, the implications of these debates are significant. The potential decision to exclude fact-checking from the discussions could reshape the way information is disseminated to voters during a highly consequential period. Critics warn that this move would set a dangerous precedent, allowing deceptive framing to enter the public conversation unchecked.

As public sentiment continues to shift, the Commission on Presidential Debates faces mounting scrutiny regarding its policies and direction. Janet Brown’s comments have compelled many, including political analysts and engaged citizens, to question how the standards for these debates will be determined and enforced. The decisions made in the coming weeks will undoubtedly have lasting effects on the political landscape and the trust voters place in the democratic process.

In the context of the upcoming debates, the conversations surrounding fact-checking are poised to remain at the forefront of public discourse. The pressure is on for moderators to strike a balance between maintaining a free-flowing debate environment and ensuring that the truth is not lost amid a barrage of misleading claims. It remains to be seen how the Commission will respond to growing demands for accountability and transparency from both sides of the political spectrum.

As the election nears, the importance of factual accuracy in political debates cannot be overstated. With so many voters relying on these events for information about the candidates, the conversations around fact-checking will undoubtedly influence how the electorate approaches the polls. As Brown and others grapple with the implications of their choices, the future of debate moderation hangs in the balance, with significant consequences for the health of American democracy.

In conclusion, while conversations about fact-checking may appear to be just another aspect of the political landscape, they touch on deeper issues of accountability, truth, and the integrity of democracy itself. The role of facts in shaping voters' perceptions cannot be ignored, and as the debate season unfolds, the eyes of the nation will be watching closely.",11.0,-25.0,839.0,0.3235294117647059,0.013110846245530394,912.0,-0.7142857142857143,-0.027412280701754384

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.

“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.

“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

In a post-debate analysis, Kellyanne Conway, a prominent advisor to the Trump campaign, commended Donald Trump for his restraint during the recent debate against Hillary Clinton. Conway asserted that Trump's ability to hold back from personal attacks, especially given the sensitive context of Clinton’s family being present in the audience, showcased his admirable character on the national stage.

During the heated exchange, Trump visibly grappled with the urge to respond more aggressively after Clinton targeted his track record with women. According to Conway, this internal conflict highlighted Trump's discomfort with launching a rough statement aimed directly at Clinton, a decision she interpreted as a sign of maturity and thoughtfulness.

Conway pointed out that although Trump had the opportunity to counter Clinton’s criticisms by addressing former President Bill Clinton’s record with women, he strategically opted to refrain from such an attack. This choice, she argued, further emphasized Trump's commitment to a more dignified approach, contrasting the often combative nature of political debates. 

Turning her attention to Clinton's performance, Conway was critical of the Democratic nominee's failure to deliver a significant rebuttal that could have capitalized on Trump’s vulnerabilities. She characterized Clinton’s approach as lacking creativity, indicating that she missed the chance to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have exposed a major misstep from Trump.

Clinton’s demeanor, according to Conway, came off as overly rehearsed, suggesting that she was more focused on adhering to her prepared talking points than authentically engaging with the debate as it unfolded. This fixation on her pre-planned remarks may have hindered Clinton's ability to connect with voters, who often seek spontaneity and genuine interaction in such high-stakes forums.

A considerable point of Conway’s critique was centered around Clinton's vision for economic growth. She posited that Clinton failed to articulate a compelling strategy that would resonate with Americans grappling with wage stagnation and economic uncertainty. Conway emphasized that effective leadership in such crucial matters requires a forward-thinking vision coupled with concrete plans to uplift the economy.

The debate showcased a stark contrast not just in styles between the candidates, but also highlighted differing approaches to leadership and prioritization in addressing critical national issues. With economic concerns at the forefront for many voters, Conway's insights signaled a need for a more substantial policy discussion from Clinton alongside her criticisms of Trump.

As the political landscape continues to evolve leading up to the election, analyses from campaign advisors like Conway are likely to play a significant role in shaping voter perceptions. Trump’s ability to present himself as a candidate who can maintain composure in the face of personal attacks may resonate positively with undecided voters, while Clinton's performance may require reevaluation to ensure her messages align with the pressing concerns of potential constituents.

In conclusion, Conway’s reflections on the debate provide a glimpse into the Trump campaign's strategy and how they aim to portray their candidate as a strong, restrained leader capable of handling personal attacks without resorting to similar tactics. The upcoming weeks will be pivotal as both candidates refine their strategies in an intense race for the presidency, with economic issues poised to become a central theme in ongoing discussions.",5.0,24.0,650.0,0.35714285714285715,0.007692307692307693,610.0,1.263157894736842,0.03934426229508197

Plastic glasses, knives, forks and food boxes are being been banned in France. (Bertrand Combaldieu/Associated Press)

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

[A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,,https://www.washingtonpost.com,{'$date': 1474243200000},,"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg&w=60,https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,"{""theme"": ""normal"", ""news_keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Washington Post"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste."", ""title"": ""France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery"", ""url"": ""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""image"": ""https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""unsafe-url"", ""twitter"": {""site"": ""@WashingtonPost"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""creator"": ""jameskmcauley""}, ""object-hash"": 1503984085, ""robots"": ""index,follow"", ""apple-itunes-app"": ""app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 500835072, ""app_id"": 41245586762}, ""keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste.""}","- France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils, effective in 2020.

In a pioneering move, France has become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils, a significant legislative change set to take effect in 2020. This landmark decision is a key part of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, integrating environmental concerns with economic policies. The initiative not only aims to reduce plastic waste but also reinforces France's commitment to battling climate change.

The newly enacted law allows for exceptions, permitting the use of items made from compostable and biosourced materials. This provision aims to ensure that while disposable products are being curtailed, there are still viable alternatives available for consumers. The decision to incorporate compostable materials reflects a broader goal to shift toward sustainable consumption patterns.

The ban is particularly significant in light of previous measures aimed at reducing plastic waste, most notably the outlawing of plastic bags in grocery stores, which began in July 2016. Together, these initiatives constitute a concerted effort to foster a ""circular economy,"" which prioritizes the design and recycling of products to minimize waste and environmental impact.

Concerns surrounding plastic usage have spurred this legislative action. Plastics are notorious for their non-biodegradability and potential to cause severe environmental harm. Furthermore, the oil consumption involved in their manufacture raises questions about sustainability and the long-term viability of such materials in a world grappling with increased demand for greener solutions.

French President François Hollande, who has been an ardent advocate for environmental reforms, underscored the importance of this ban as a step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing the use of renewable energy sources. Hollande's administration views this initiative as crucial to not only protecting the environment but also aligning with international efforts aimed at sustainability.

However, the ban has not been met with universal support. Critics, including Eamonn Bates, a representative from Pack2Go Europe, argue that the ban may contravene EU legislation regarding the free movement of goods within member states. Bates emphasized that the organization anticipates legal challenges should the European Commission choose not to intervene on this matter. The impending legal confrontation raises questions about the balance between national environmental policies and broader European Union regulations.

The push to implement the ban earlier than 2020, initially targeting a start date as soon as 2017, faced opposition due to concerns regarding the potential impact on low-income families. Discussions around how these households would adapt to the ban highlighted the complexities involved in transitioning to an eco-friendlier environment while also considering the economic ramifications for all citizens.

As the effective date for the ban approaches, France's bold step serves as a potential template for other nations grappling with similar environmental challenges. The ongoing dialogue around the ban’s implications and the accompanying legal hurdles will be instrumental in shaping the future of plastic consumption and environmental policy in Europe and beyond.",-14.0,-1.0,529.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.026465028355387523,541.0,-0.047619047619047616,-0.0018484288354898336

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump.

""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,"" Ryan said.

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.

But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.

What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.

The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said.

As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first?

CHARLOTTE, NC – The shooting of a black man by Charlotte police has ignited widespread anger and unrest throughout North Carolina, culminating in violent riots that engulfed the city. The community has responded with a flurry of emotions, with protests quickly escalating into chaos characterized by looting and the theft of property. Demonstrators took to the streets, and I-85, a major interstate highway, was shut down due to the disturbances.

The victim, identified as 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, has been portrayed by supporters as an innocent individual engaged in charitable activities who was taken from his family far too soon. This narrative has fueled sentiments within the community and added to the urgency for change in police practices and accountability. While many express outrage and grief, speculation continues surrounding the police's side of the incident and how it may impact public perception amid the turmoil.

In response to the unrest, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney faced the media at a news conference to address the critical situation. He explained that officers were in pursuit of a suspect when Scott exited his vehicle carrying a handgun. In a tense standoff, police instructed Scott to drop the weapon. However, he allegedly exited the vehicle a second time still armed, which Chief Putney stated posed a significant threat, ultimately leading to the shooting of Scott.

Chief Putney's remarks have sparked a larger conversation about the challenging nature of law enforcement's split-second decision-making in high-stress environments. He highlighted the concerns of law enforcement regarding their safety while emphasizing the need to shift the narrative surrounding the events that transpired. His comments aim to clarify the complexities of policing, especially in volatile situations where public safety must be weighed against individual rights.

As the protests escalate, there is also a critique emerging against progressive viewpoints on policing and public safety. Some argue that the current narrative detracts from the real challenges law enforcement faces while trying to maintain order and enforce the law. This discourse has amplified amidst the calls for accountability, illustrating the deep divides that exist within the community regarding policing practices.

The unrest sparked by Scott's shooting is reflective of broader issues of race, justice, and community trust in law enforcement. While city leaders and activists work towards dialogue, addressing the concerns raised by community members, the situation remains tense as Charlotte struggles to find a path forward. 

Communities nationwide are watching the events in Charlotte, recognizing the importance of this incident not just locally, but on a national scale. As debates about police reform and public safety continue to gain momentum, the outcomes of the discussions surrounding Scott's shooting may play a pivotal role in shaping future policies and community relations.

In the wake of the riots and the ongoing tension in Charlotte, the community must grapple with the questions of accountability, justice, and familial loss. As protests continue, the demand for answers grows louder—a call not just for justice for Keith Lamont Scott, but for a re-examination of the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve.",-23.0,-27.0,562.0,-0.9583333333333334,-0.04092526690391459,578.0,-1.2272727272727273,-0.04671280276816609

ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June.

The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

""The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,"" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. ""As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.""

Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.

Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.

Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.

Real_6-Webpage,Obama weighs in on the debate,"Obama weighs in on the debate

President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change.

The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.”

And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.”

The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both.

""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012

""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,"" Obama said, ""that worries me.""

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is ""naturally occurring.""

Obama emphasized that the gravity of the office requires a leader who is not only knowledgeable but also possesses the necessary qualities to navigate complex global threats.

One of Obama’s key concerns lies in Trump’s capacity to contend with serious issues such as nuclear proliferation and climate change. He voiced distrust in Trump’s ability to manage these critical challenges, which he believes are paramount for the safety and sustainability of future generations. Obama pointed out that Trump’s suggestions, including the potential for Japan and Korea to acquire their own nuclear weapons, reflect a concerning approach to international security and stability.

Obama also criticized Trump for lacking the core values of inclusion, underscoring the importance of providing opportunities that genuinely benefit the country. He posited that presidential leadership should be rooted in fostering unity and promoting policies conducive to the collective welfare of all citizens.

In the same vein, Obama expressed admiration for Hillary Clinton’s debate performances and qualifications, contrasting them sharply with Trump’s approach. He noted that Clinton demonstrated the capability and composure necessary to lead during times of uncertainty, further solidifying his endorsement of her candidacy over Trump.

Additionally, Obama addressed Trump’s controversial remarks regarding climate change, particularly the assertion that it is a hoax created by China. This sentiment has been a lingering point of contention, as Obama highlighted the need for climate action grounded in scientific understanding, rather than political rhetoric. He referenced Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who claimed that Trump believes climate change is “naturally occurring,” indicating a significant divergence in understanding environmental challenges.

Obama’s criticisms of Trump extend beyond individual statements; they are rooted in a broader ideological divide. The former president has consistently advocated for policies that seek to address existential threats, while expressing skepticism towards Trump's approach to governance and global issues.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Obama’s remarks underscore the ongoing debate about the qualities and values required in leadership, particularly in an era marked by urgency in addressing nuclear dangers and climate change.

Real_60-Webpage,How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying “yes” to Fox News almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning, he is booked on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn’t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

In an election climate marked by fierce competition, Donald Trump has taken a notable turn in his media strategy, opting for a more focused approach that could impact his outreach to voters. Known historically for his openness to media inquiries, Trump has recently shifted to primarily engaging with Fox News, sidestepping other major networks in favor of segments on the conservative outlet.

This strategic pivot finds Trump appearing daily on shows like ""Fox & Friends"" and ""The O’Reilly Factor,"" as he prepares for a town hall event hosted by Sean Hannity. With each appearance, he appears to be homing in on energizing his base of loyal supporters rather than reaching out to undecided voters. This tactic, however, poses risks, as it may limit his exposure to challenging questions that could arise in a more neutral media environment.

Trump’s choice to engage primarily with Fox News aligns with his preference for non-confrontational interviews, allowing him to steer clear of more difficult inquiries related to controversial topics. While this strategy may afford him short-term comfort in addressing an audience sympathetic to his viewpoints, it raises concerns regarding his ability to connect with a broader electorate necessary for potential electoral success.

The current campaign strategy mirrors past successful tactics used by politicians like George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who held rallies in crucial swing districts to gather support. However, Trump’s approach diverges significantly, focusing primarily on solidifying his existing base rather than actively courting those wavering in their political alignment. This insular rallying to his most ardent supporters could leave him vulnerable as the election draws closer.

Moreover, analysts caution that leaning heavily on Fox News may not yield the desired results in the general election. The article notes that reliance on a singular network carries the risk of a repeat of the unexpected outcomes seen during the 2012 election, where significant segments of Fox News' audience were blindsided by the election results. As Trump navigates the campaign trail leading up to 2024, it remains to be seen whether this strategy will ultimately pay off, or if it risks alienating potential voters whose support he will need to reclaim the presidency. 

As the landscape evolves, Trump's choices could shape the future of his campaign and the broader political discourse in America. Whether he will expand his media engagement to include a wider range of audiences, or stick to his current approach, remains a critical question ahead of the upcoming electoral battle.",-1.0,28.0,421.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.0023752969121140144,474.0,1.75,0.05907172995780591
Real_61-Webpage,“Why Aren’t I 50 Points Ahead?” – Eagle Rising,"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again.

Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.

But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.”

For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.

Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump?

At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question:

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

As the 2016 presidential election loomed closer, many in the liberal camp believed that Hillary Clinton's victory was a foregone conclusion. This mindset led to a perception that the campaign itself was little more than a formality. However, as the election season intensified, the realities of the race began to shift dramatically, especially with the emergence of Donald Trump.

Clinton's campaign initially opted for a strategy that involved minimal interaction with the press, which inadvertently allowed Trump to seize the spotlight and dominate media coverage. This approach, while calculated, began to backfire as recent post-Democratic National Convention (DNC) developments showed Trump gaining significant traction in various polls. These changes prompted discussions among some Democrats regarding a potential ""Plan B,"" as anxiety about the election's outcome grew.

Recent polling data underscored the shift in momentum, indicating that Trump was leading in several key battleground states. This alarming trend raised serious concerns within Clinton's camp, as they grappled with the possibility of an unforeseen challenge to her candidacy. The realization that the race would not be as straightforward as initially thought prompted Clinton to confront the situation head-on during a campaign event held in Las Vegas.

At the event, Clinton expressed her frustration by questioning why she wasn’t ""50 points ahead"" given the circumstances. This rhetorical inquiry highlighted her apprehension and the mounting unease among her supporters. Clinton stressed the necessity of informing voters about Trump’s track record, recognizing that many potential Trump supporters remained unaware of the implications of their choices.

During her speech, Clinton encouraged her supporters to take an active role in conversations with potential Trump voters. She coined the phrase, “Friends don’t let friends vote for Trump,” emphasizing the need for dialogue aimed at persuading undecided voters about the dangers of a Trump presidency. This call to action was a clear signal of her determination to galvanize her base and counteract her opponent's growing influence.

As the election drew nearer, Clinton's campaign realized that complacency could no longer be an option. The need for effective communication, voter engagement, and strategic outreach became critical components of their efforts to secure a victory in an increasingly unpredictable electoral landscape.",11.0,10.0,413.0,0.6875,0.026634382566585957,428.0,0.5882352941176471,0.02336448598130841

Over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, Bobby Knight said Wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like Donald Trump.

""There’s nobody that I’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right,"" Knight told an audience in Toledo, Ohio, his home state. ""And I think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United States. And there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been Donald Trump.""

Story Continued Below

Back on the campaign trail with Trump after several months, Knight extolled the Republican nominee as ""not just an American; he’s a world figure.""

""He’s known all over the world. Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together,"" the coach continued. ""United States around the world. A lot of businesses. Created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world.""

And Trump, Knight later indicated, is the person for the White House.

""Believe me when I tell you, I think you’re all gonna agree on this: Our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the United States of America,"" Knight said. He noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, ""immigration problems and on and on.""

Remarking on his study of history, Knight said that he had come to the conclusion that ""when I need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man I want to choose and the first man I want to see.""

Knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't ""dress as well as politicians dress, but I want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, I wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""

""And I think that when you leave, I hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the United States,"" Knight said.

Toledo, Ohio — Legendary basketball coach Bobby Knight made headlines recently as he publicly endorsed former President Donald Trump during an event that attracted a crowd eager for political discourse. Knight, known for his fiery coaching style and success in the NCAA basketball world, praised Trump's capability to identify and rectify problems, marking the former president as a significant figure on both a national and global scale.

At the gathering, Knight articulated a strong admiration for Trump's unique problem-solving abilities. ""I've never met anyone better than him at identifying and fixing issues,"" Knight stated, emphasizing his belief in Trump's effectiveness as a leader. His endorsement didn't stop at mere compliments; Knight expressed his confidence in Trump’s suitability for the presidency, particularly in the areas of governance that require immediate attention and resolution.

Knight's remarks included a candid acknowledgment of the pressing challenges that lie ahead for the next president, such as the burgeoning national debt and complex immigration issues. ""The next president will have a tough road ahead,"" he remarked, highlighting the necessity of strong leadership to navigate these critical matters.

The coach’s endorsement was informed by his extensive study of history, where he deemed Trump as his preferred choice for a “problem-solving partner.” This historical perspective underscored Knight’s commitment to a pragmatic approach in evaluating leadership capabilities, placing a premium on the ability to tackle real-world issues.

In addition to his supportive comments about Trump, Knight made a patriotic statement by donning a red, white, and blue gingham shirt. This attire served not just as personal fashion but as a rallying cry for attendees to showcase their patriotism. Knight encouraged the audience to wear similar colors, creating a visual tapestry of American pride that resonated throughout the event.

Trump, who has remained at the center of contemporary political discussions, continues to gather endorsements from influential figures, and Knight's support adds to this chorus. It reflects a segment of the population that not only seeks strong leadership but also looks for a candidate who can tackle America's ongoing challenges head-on.

Knight's remarks resonate with many supporters who believe that effective leadership is essential to resolving pressing national concerns. As he articulated that Trump stands out in his ability to confront and solve issues, it’s clear that Knight's backing is an attempt to unify supporters around a common vision for America’s future.

The event in Toledo has drawn attention not just for Knight's endorsement but also for the message it carries about the current political landscape. As the 2024 presidential race begins to take shape, such endorsements may play a pivotal role in shaping how voters perceive candidates and their capabilities.

In a climate of increasing political polarization, Knight’s words serve as a reminder that endorsement from respected figures can significantly influence public opinion. His direct appeal to problem-solving as a key factor in leadership may resonate with those grappling with the complexities facing the nation today. As the electoral process progresses, it will be intriguing to see how such endorsements impact Trump's campaign and the broader political narrative leading up to the election.",10.0,66.0,540.0,0.5882352941176471,0.018518518518518517,603.0,3.3,0.10945273631840796

Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it. Although Islamic terrorism would seem to be the most likely explanation, there have been “mad bombers” who’ve done this sort of thing before (See Ted Kaczynski & George Metesky).

Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation.

That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.

ELIZABETH, NJ – In a concerning turn of events, authorities have uncovered three pipe bombs and two smaller explosive devices in a trash can located near the NJ Transit Station in Elizabeth. The discovery has prompted an ongoing investigation involving the FBI, who are currently on the scene assessing the situation.

Elizabeth Mayor has reported the incident, emphasizing the urgency of the investigation following the alarming trend of recent explosions in the region. These findings come on the heels of earlier blasts reported on the Jersey Shore and in New York, sparking speculation about a potential connection between these events.

As officials work to determine the origin and intent behind the devices, there is rising concern that a small group or an individual may be responsible for the series of incidents. The nature of the devices has led investigators to consider multiple motives, with Islamic terrorism being viewed as a plausible angle. However, there are also historical references to notorious ""mad bombers,"" suggesting a broader spectrum of possible motivations.

In a related development, the FBI has arrested five individuals in connection with the recent Chelsea bombing investigation, although no formal charges have been filed as of yet. This aspect of the investigation adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing inquiry in Elizabeth, as law enforcement officials work to discern whether there are links between the arrests and the discoveries made at the train station.

As details continue to emerge, authorities are urging the public to remain vigilant and prioritize safety in light of the recent events. The Elizabeth community is on alert, and local law enforcement is advising residents to report any suspicious activity.

President Barack Obama also sat down with Zach Galifianakis to tout the Affordable Care Act

(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it.

Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video , plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself.

""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs.

Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump.

""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention.

Magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect

A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said.

""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening.

Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami.

""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer.""

The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.

Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

The defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, James Patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.

In a significant ruling, a federal magistrate has denied a request for the immediate arraignment of Ahmad Rahami, the suspected perpetrator of a recent bombing incident. U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein presided over the case and determined that Rahami remains in local custody in New Jersey rather than in federal custody, which influenced the ruling.

The government has publicly stated that it has not arrested Rahami, and there is currently no evidence to contradict this assertion. The clarification regarding his status is crucial, as it underlines the procedural intricacies involved in cases transitioning from local to federal jurisdiction.

Judge Gorenstein pointed out the complications surrounding Rahami’s questioning by federal authorities, stressing that the information available lacks evidence of him being officially under federal detention at this time. This factor played a significant role in the magistrate's decision to deny the prompt arraignment.

Moreover, Gorenstein rejected arguments made by the defense, which claimed that federal court rules mandate an immediate arraignment, disregarding the current conditions of Rahami's local custody. He emphasized that the arrangements pertaining to Rahami’s legal status and custody must be clearly established before proceeding with an arraignment.

The magistrate also declined to set a court date for Rahami, who is presently hospitalized in Newark, further complicating the situation. His health status has become a critical consideration as the legal proceedings progress.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch has indicated that arrangements are being made for Rahami to be transported to New York City to face the federal charges against him. However, the timeline for when this transfer will take place remains unclear, as it is contingent upon both his medical condition and the legal decisions pending.

In a further attempt to address the situation, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office decided not to comment on the magistrate's ruling, suggesting a cautious approach in response to ongoing legal proceedings and public scrutiny.

Likewise, defense attorney James Patton has not provided any remarks in response to the ruling, leaving some questions and speculation surrounding the next steps for Rahami in the judicial system.

As the case unfolds, the legal intricacies and the status of Ahmad Rahami will remain a focal point of interest. The denial of immediate arraignment is expected to influence future debates regarding jurisdictional authority, custody rights, and the complexities inherent in transitioning cases from state to federal courts. As more information becomes available, updates on Rahami’s transport and arraignment will be closely monitored.",-25.0,-16.0,471.0,-1.5625,-0.05307855626326964,466.0,-0.9411764705882353,-0.034334763948497854
Real_66-Webpage,US: ISIS did not use mustard agent in base attack,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL — OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

In a significant development for US forces in the region, a final laboratory test of a weapon fired by ISIS at US troops has tested negative for the presence of mustard agent. The incident occurred at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq on September 20, prompting initial concerns about chemical weapon exposure among US personnel.

Following initial tests that indicated the possible presence of a chemical weapon, swift action was taken to decontaminate the affected areas to ensure the safety of troops. However, confirming recent reports, Col. John Dorrian took to Twitter to announce that definitive lab results revealed no chemical weapon had been present in the munitions analyzed.

The situation surrounding the weapon escalated when Gen. Joseph Dunford previously assessed it as a sulfur mustard blister agent during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. This assertion highlighted the potential risks associated with ISIS's arsenal. However, the final test results from the laboratory provided a necessary clarification.

Earlier testing surrounding the weapon’s chemical composition yielded mixed results: one test indicated the presence of a chemical agent, another returned a negative result, while a third remained inconclusive.

Real_67-Webpage,"Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say","The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.

""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.

Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.

A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.

The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.

""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

Andres Kudacki/AP Photo

Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.

He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""

James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.

""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.

""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg,"More Meghan,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997,"{""fb_title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@mkeneally"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-19"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-19 18:04:32"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race""}","- Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have heightened interest in candidates' national security policies.

Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, alongside a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have ignited a keen interest in the national security policies of political candidates as the nation grapples with fear and uncertainty. The attacks, which resulted in numerous injuries, prompted immediate responses from prominent figures such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as they navigated the charged atmosphere and addressed the concerns of voters.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator, emphasized that violent incidents like these significantly influence voter sentiment. He noted that such attacks tend to increase fear among the electorate, often leading them to gravitate toward candidates who project strength and decisiveness in matters of security. The urgency of national security policies has taken center stage in political discussions as the landscape shifts in light of these recent events.

Prior to the attacks, three national polls had indicated that Clinton was leading Trump when it came to trust regarding the handling of terrorism. An ABC News/Washington Post poll revealed that Clinton had a notable advantage, garnering 50% support compared to Trump's 41% among adults and 48% to 45% among likely voters. Furthermore, a CBS/New York Times poll identified that 49% of respondents believed Clinton was better positioned to manage terrorism, whereas 45% opted for Trump. A Quinnipiac poll showed a tighter race, with Clinton securing 49% to Trump's 47%.

Cohen highlighted a historical trend where Republicans are generally perceived as strong on law enforcement and national security matters. However, this perception appears to be shifting against Trump due to rising concerns about his grasp of the complexities surrounding terrorism. As the candidates evaluate their communications and tailor their speeches to address the pressing topic of national security, a sense of urgency and recalibration is palpable within their campaigns.

Cohen also expressed concern over Trump’s rhetoric regarding foreign Muslims, suggesting that such statements may inadvertently inspire acts associated with ISIS. The implications of this rhetoric extend beyond immediate political ramifications, as it raises questions about inclusivity and the potential alienation of certain community groups.

In contrast, political science professor James Campbell posited that terrorist attacks could paradoxically assist Trump in galvanizing political support. He argued that such incidents may signal to voters a perceived failure of the current administration’s foreign policies, thus driving a narrative that could benefit Trump's campaign. Campbell indicated that public reactions to the attacks may lead to calls for more stringent immigration standards and heightened scrutiny against individuals with Muslim-sounding names, which could further fuel a divisive dialogue in the political arena.

As candidates like Clinton and Trump navigate the implications of these recent events, national security remains a pivotal issue as voters look for solutions and leadership in times of crisis. The shifts in sentiment and trust concerning terrorism and security policies highlight a critical moment in the electoral process as campaigns adapt to a changing narrative that intertwines fear, politics, and perceptions of strength.

The recent attacks have underscored the urgent need for a candid national discourse on security policies, and as the political landscape continues to evolve, the candidates are expected to maintain a keen focus on the narratives surrounding safety, perceptions of strength, and community relations in their messaging. The road ahead will undoubtedly be shaped by the reactions to these incidents, as candidates vie for voter trust in a climate charged with uncertainty and concern.",6.0,11.0,604.0,0.3333333333333333,0.009933774834437087,633.0,0.5238095238095238,0.017377567140600316

When is the first general election presidential debate?

The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.

Story Continued Below

What time is the debate and how long is it?

The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.

How can I watch the debate?

It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.

Who will participate in the debate?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.

Who will moderate the debate?

Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.

What is the format of the debate?

The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.

Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?

Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.

What's at stake for Hillary Clinton?

The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.

What's at stake for Donald Trump?

Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again.

What is the most watched debate in presidential history?

In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.

What's the most-watched television moment of all time?

Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.

Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.

As the 2016 presidential race heats up, the first general election debate is scheduled to take place on September 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. The highly anticipated event will commence at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, stretching for a total of 90 minutes without any commercial breaks, marking a significant moment in the electoral season.

The debate will feature two of the most recognizable figures in American politics: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. The absence of any other candidates is notable, as Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party were not invited due to their failure to meet the required 15% threshold in selected national polls. Their exclusion highlights the focus on the two leading candidates in this election cycle.

This debate will be moderated by Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."" This will mark Holt's second stint in the role during the 2016 presidential campaign, lending a seasoned voice to the proceedings as he navigates the candidates through a series of pressing questions. The format of the debate consists of six segments, each lasting 15 minutes, allowing Holt to pose questions that will prompt initial responses from both candidates followed by opportunities for interactive engagement. 

Tentative topics for discussion include ""America's direction,"" ""achieving prosperity,"" and ""securing America."" While these subjects are poised for exploration, they remain open to adjustment based on the rapidly changing news landscape in the weeks leading up to the event. Concerns regarding policy knowledge and self-restraint are expected to be focal points, especially for Trump, who will utilize this platform to rebut any assertions aimed at his competence.

For Clinton, the debate serves as a critical opportunity to uphold her lead in the polls, capitalizing on her extensive debate experience against the relative newcomer to the political arena, Trump. The dynamics will be intriguing as both candidates vie for public opinion. Clinton enters the debate from a position of historical comparison; the most-watched debate to date occurred in 1980 between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, amassing a staggering 80.6 million viewers.

The stakes are especially high for Trump, as the debate allows him to confront criticisms that have arisen about his policy knowledge and ability to maintain composure during high-pressure situations. The expectations surrounding his performance are relatively low, potentially working in his favor as he seeks to shift the narrative through this high-profile debate.

The debate will be broadcast across major television networks and online on platforms associated with significant cable news channels and C-SPAN, ensuring that millions of Americans will have access to witness this essential electoral moment. With cable news being more accessible than ever before, the conversation surrounding the debate will spill over into social media and various online forums, reaching an even broader audience.

In the context of television viewership, the 2016 debate is poised to attract significant numbers, yet it may still fall short of the most-watched television program in U.S. history, which is Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, boasting 114 million viewers. However, worldwide viewership events provide perspective on potential reach; for instance, the first moon landing captivated an audience of 600 million globally, while the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana drew in 750 million viewers. 

The significance of the upcoming debate cannot be overstated—it has the potential to shift perceptions, bolster support, and shape the trajectory of the campaigns in the months leading up to the election. As the nation prepares for this pivotal moment, many eyes will be fixed on Hofstra University, anticipating a showcase of rhetoric, policy, and charisma as Clinton and Trump go head-to-head.

With the frameworks set and the date approaching, the September 26 debate promises to be an unforgettable spectacle in the annals of American political history, laden with implications that will extend far beyond the debate stage. As the candidates gear up, the American public watches with bated breath, ready to engage in the electoral dialogue that defines democracy.",14.0,34.0,780.0,0.3684210526315789,0.017948717948717947,762.0,1.4166666666666667,0.04461942257217848

Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday in Linden, N.J. | Nicolaus Czarnecki/Boston Herald via AP U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing.

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.

However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved.

""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""

The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.

Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.

While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.

The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.

Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.

Ahmad Khan Rahami is currently in custody following a police shootout in Linden, New Jersey. The incident left both Rahami and two police officers injured, leading to a series of serious criminal charges against him.

On September 28, Rahami is scheduled to make his initial court appearance regarding five attempted murder charges stemming from the altercation with law enforcement. Though he is hospitalized in Newark with a bail set at an imposing $5.2 million, the legal proceedings surrounding his case are already proving complex.

Defense attorneys representing Rahami recently requested a court proceeding to formally inform him of the charges he faces as well as his legal rights. However, federal prosecutors are opposing this demand for an immediate arraignment on federal charges. They made it clear that Rahami is not currently in federal custody but rather being held in New Jersey on state charges, which complicates matters further for his defense team.

Current reports suggest that there is confusion regarding whether Rahami has been adequately advised of his Miranda rights or if he has chosen to forego consulting with an attorney. Lawmakers have expressed concerns that Rahami has not cooperated with the ongoing investigation, raising further questions about his ability to mount an effective defense.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch indicated earlier that plans were in place to move Rahami to Manhattan, although prosecutors seem to be showing no urgency for this transfer. This hesitance suggests that there may be continued legal maneuvers or discussions about the nature of the charges Rahami will eventually face in a federal setting.

The Federal Defenders office has sought to be appointed to represent Rahami, but prosecutors argue that such a request is premature given his current state of custody and the nature of the charges against him. As of now, court records indicate that there has been no immediate response to the defense’s requests for either an arraignment or the appointment of legal counsel that could expedite his case.

As Rahami remains hospitalized and prepares to face serious charges, the legal team and prosecutors will continue to navigate the complexities of his case amidst an evolving landscape of charges and potential federal involvement. Rahami’s future in the legal system is now intertwined with a series of procedural questions that may influence the outcomes of the proceedings ahead.

As the initial court date of September 28 approaches, it remains to be seen whether any new developments will impact Rahami’s situation or any potential move to federal custody. Meanwhile, the atmosphere surrounding the investigation and subsequent legal action is one of uncertainty, particularly given the alleged lack of cooperation from Rahami during the investigative process.

The community in Linden, NJ, remains shocked by the events that unfolded during the shootout, and there is a palpable sense of anticipation for how this case will unfold in the coming weeks. With significant charges on the table, including multiple counts of attempted murder, the stakes are high for Rahami as he faces the possibility of a long and arduous legal battle. Prosecutors and defense attorneys alike are likely preparing for various scenarios as they await his initial appearance in court. As the legal process continues, observers will be closely watching for any significant developments in Rahami's case.",-21.0,-20.0,597.0,-1.05,-0.035175879396984924,601.0,-0.9523809523809523,-0.033277870216306155
Real_7-Webpage,Donald Trump's rise puts Ted Cruz in a bind,"Story highlights Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump earlier this year, but is under pressure to change his mind now

Cruz could face a primary challenge in 2018 from a fellow Republican

Washington (CNN) Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said.

JUST WATCHED Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife 01:51

On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them.""

Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

Cruz's supporters, however, advocate for him to maintain his current refusal, warning that an endorsement might alienate his base. This faction believes that sticking to his principles is paramount and that endorsing Trump would contradict Cruz’s established values.

Steve Deace, an influential Iowa radio talk show host and a notable supporter of Cruz, articulated concerns that an endorsement would conflict with the core beliefs that distinguish Cruz from other GOP candidates. Trump’s supporters, meanwhile, are pressing for maximum buy-in from key figures like Cruz to showcase momentum as they approach the election. 

Cruz finds himself in a precarious position, as Trump's poll numbers rise against Clinton, creating an urgency for alignment within the Republican ranks. The pressure mounts for Cruz to navigate this delicate situation, balancing party loyalty with the convictions that initially propelled his candidacy. As the clock ticks down to Election Day, the consequences of his decision will resonate beyond the campaign trail.",10.0,14.0,294.0,1.1111111111111112,0.034013605442176874,285.0,1.2727272727272727,0.04912280701754386

Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks.

The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe.

“Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.”

Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.”

“They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”

These comments came in the wake of recent violent incidents in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, which have raised concerns about domestic security.

Real_71-Webpage,Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible',"Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.

Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.

Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""

On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""

""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.

A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.

""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.

Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.

Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.

This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.

Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.

Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.

Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.

On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.

Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""

Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.

""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.

Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.

Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.

All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.

On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.

""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.

A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.

Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""

Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.

Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.

Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.

In a high-profile courtroom drama surrounding the infamous September 2013 lane closures on the George Washington Bridge, former Port Authority executive David Wildstein presented damning testimony that hinted at politically motivated machinations from top staffers in then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s administration. The closures, aimed at causing significant traffic disruptions in Fort Lee, were allegedly designed to exert political pressure on the town's mayor, marking a controversial chapter in local governance and public service ethics.

Wildstein, who held a significant position as a director at the Port Authority, detailed during his testimony how Bridget Kelly, Christie’s former deputy chief of staff, grew frustrated over her inability to secure the endorsement of a Democratic mayor for Christie’s reelection campaign. This frustration, Wildstein suggested, catalyzed a scheme that would ultimately lead to the strategic closure of bridge access lanes. As he recounted, the scheme was not only intended to create traffic problems but also to send a clear message to Fort Lee’s Mayor Mark Sokolich regarding political allegiance.

Wildstein’s testimony unfolded as part of a plea agreement after he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and a civil rights violation. On August 13, 2013, he disclosed that Kelly had communicated the plan to create traffic issues in Fort Lee. This concerning agenda was solidified in a phone call between him and Kelly on the same day, where they confirmed their intentions to move forward with the lane closures.

As the mastermind behind the initiative, Wildstein described a chilling disregard for the implications of their actions, stating he did not question the directive and instead coordinated the lane closures with both Kelly and his supervisor, Bill Baroni. In a striking revelation, he noted their collective decision to provide no advance notice about the impending closures to either Fort Lee officials or the general public. All ensuing inquiries were redirected to Baroni’s office, establishing a framework of information control intended to minimize accountability.

Baroni’s role, as described by Wildstein, was pivotal in the decision-making process. He recollected Baroni’s approval of a “radio silence” strategy, aiming to amplify the traffic disruptions experienced by Fort Lee’s residents. Wildstein even reminisced about Baroni’s enthusiastic response upon learning that the closures would coincide with the very first day of school in Fort Lee, set for September 9, further indicating the intent to maximize the impact of the closures on the community.

Initially, the plan was to close three access lanes, but due to safety concerns arising from engineer assessments, Wildstein ultimately opted to restrict the closures to just two lanes. On September 6, 2013, he informed Port Authority staff that the lane closures would begin three days later, while expressing awareness of the potential for significant traffic chaos. Nevertheless, he instructed his colleagues to refer all public inquiries back to Baroni and misled them by claiming that the closures were part of a traffic study—a tactic that further obscured their true intention.

As the lane closures commenced, the rush-hour traffic quickly intensified. Wildstein diligently monitored the situation, communicating with Kelly, who reportedly expressed satisfaction with the ensuing traffic chaos. Meanwhile, Fort Lee officials, including Mayor Sokolich, desperately attempted to reach out to both Baroni and Wildstein to understand the sudden disruptions affecting their town. However, their attempts were met with a consistent adherence to the “radio silence” policy, a commitment to keeping the lines of communication closed.

Through his testimony, Wildstein painted a picture of Baroni as an enforcer of Christie’s political agenda, adhering to a “one constituent rule” that implied Christie's interests outweighed the needs of the public. This strategy appeared to underscore an overarching ethos within the Christie administration—one that allegedly prioritized political maneuvering over the welfare of local populations.

As the fallout from the trial continues, both Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges linked to the George Washington Bridge lane closures. In what has become a heated courtroom battle, both defendants plan to testify in their defense, promising a further exploration of the motivations and dynamics that characterized this political scandal.

The repercussions of the lane closures have been far-reaching, raising questions about the ethical responsibilities of public officials and their duty to serve their constituents rather than personal political objectives. With Wildstein’s testimony serving as a crucial piece of the puzzle, attention remains focused on how the courts will interpret these actions and their implications for public service accountability.

This continuing legal saga underscores not only the intricacies of political ambition but also the potential costs to civic trust and governance. As the case unfolds, many are left to ponder the lasting impact of these decisions on Fort Lee, its residents, and the broader political landscape in New Jersey.

The George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal has not only highlighted the complexities and challenges of political maneuvering but also left an indelible mark on public perception of governance integrity. As more details emerge from testimonies and ongoing investigations, the quest for justice remains paramount for many stakeholders affected by the unprecedented disruption brought about by these actions. 

In conclusion, as both sides prepare for further confrontations in court, the narrative of the George Washington Bridge lane closures serves as a cautionary tale of how political ambitions can collide with public service, reshaping the landscape of trust and accountability in political institutions. With Wildstein taking the stand, the trial continues to unfold, and the implications of his disclosures reverberate within the corridors of New Jersey's political arena, leaving citizens to contemplate the true costs of political gamesmanship.",9.0,-20.0,1009.0,0.225,0.008919722497522299,1057.0,-0.6060606060606061,-0.01892147587511826

It's living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state

(CNN) Florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the November election.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched.

The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.

""So if I had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin,"" says USF Tampa political scientist Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor at the University of South Florida. ""We're to the point where anything is possible. This is just one of those kind of elections.""

All eyes are on central Florida's I-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. The area stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics.

Renowned for its unpredictable election outcomes, Florida is living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state.

A recent CNN/ORC poll reveals a tight race, showing Trump at 47% and Clinton at 44%, a result that falls within the 3.5% margin of error. This polling data suggests that Clinton's post-Democratic convention momentum may be waning, raising questions about her ability to maintain a competitive edge.

Particularly significant in this electoral showdown is the I-4 corridor, a vital region that stretches from Tampa to Daytona Beach.

Real_74-Webpage,HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night’s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Here’s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday’s debate? — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet’s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

There’s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night’s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins aren’t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

@HuffingtonPost someone’s upset that #Trumpwins — Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? — Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ? pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y — Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn’t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate – except for the little watched @CNN poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, “Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN’s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.” They actually looks like they’re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

In the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, public opinion appears starkly divided, reflecting the complexities of election polling in the digital age. A CNN/ORC poll has found that 62% of respondents believe Hillary Clinton emerged victorious from the debate, reinforcing her standing among traditional polling outlets. However, contrasting narratives have surfaced from various online platforms, where numerous informal polls have claimed Donald Trump won by a landslide.

This discrepancy has drawn scrutiny, particularly from outlets like the Huffington Post, which question the reliability of online polls compared to CNN's established methodology. The Huffington Post's analysis indicates that while CNN employs rigorous statistical practices to arrive at its conclusions, online polls can be easily manipulated, raising concerns about their validity as a measure of public sentiment.

Critics point out that Trump's supporters have utilized platforms like 4chan and Reddit to skew online polls in his favor. This tactic has garnered significant attention and criticism, as many argue it undermines the integrity and accuracy of these informal polls. The ongoing debate about the efficacy of online polling has ignited conversations on social media, leading to frustration among many Trump supporters regarding the Huffington Post article. 

In response to the differing poll results, Donald Trump has taken to social media to emphasize the favorable feedback he claims to receive from online polls. He stated that he has won all but the CNN poll, suggesting a clear disconnect between traditional and online polling methods. To further bolster his stance, Trump highlighted the trending Twitter topic #TrumpWon, which his supporters have utilized to express their belief in his debate performance.

In tandem with his social media efforts, Trump shared a Daily Mail article that discussed the striking discrepancies between online poll results and those produced by CNN. The article echoes sentiments voiced by many in Trump’s camp, who are adamant that the online response accurately reflects public opinion. 

Despite these contrasting views and the fervent discussions surrounding the debate's outcome, a consensus seems to form. The overarching sentiment appears to lean toward Clintons's advantage, with many experts still concluding that she was the clear winner of the debate.

In navigating this complex scenario, it is vital to consider the implications of polling in modern election discourse. The reliance on online platforms as barometers for political success continues to evolve, highlighting how these digital spaces can distort traditional understandings of voter sentiment. As this debate unfolds, it serves as a reminder of the intricacies and challenges posed by technology in political communication.

As voters continue to engage and share their opinions, the dialogue surrounding effective polling methodologies is likely to remain a prominent feature of the electoral landscape. The divergence between CNN's results and the overwhelming support for Trump found in online polls may signify an ongoing challenge for both campaigns and polling organizations as they seek to gauge the electorate accurately.

In the days ahead, the implications of these findings will undoubtedly influence the campaign strategies of both candidates as they strive to appeal to a polarized electorate grappling with an increasingly fragmented media landscape.",35.0,35.0,556.0,1.75,0.06294964028776978,578.0,1.6666666666666667,0.06055363321799308

He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson

(CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose.

""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week.

Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history.

""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. It may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. That's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history.""

Real_76-Webpage,Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s Vice President Joe Biden.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday’s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

“This is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?”

Adding:

“Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

“He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘You’re fired.’ They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

“He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

“If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord… What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.”

And it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Watch Biden lay into Trump here:

In a spirited campaign event for Hillary Clinton held in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden took the stage to rally support and voice strong criticism against Republican nominee Donald Trump. Biden's remarks came in the wake of Trump’s controversial statements during a recent debate, where he suggested he benefited from the housing market failure.

With a tone of incredulity, Biden questioned Trump’s understanding of what it means to be an American, asserting that prior presidents possessed a moral center that he believes Trump lacks. ""There’s a fundamental difference between someone who understands the responsibility of leadership and someone who exploits the system for personal gain,"" Biden stated, reflecting on the qualities that he feels should define a leader in the nation.

Biden painted a picture of what he perceives to be the values that separate traditional politicians from Trump. He accused the real estate mogul of disregarding basic sensibilities that most politicians uphold. “It is not just about winning at all costs; it’s about the values of integrity, responsibility, and compassion for the people you serve,” Biden declared, urging voters to consider the implications of electing someone who does not embody those traits.

One of the focal points of his critique was Trump’s pride in not paying taxes. Biden expressed his anger over this statement, emphasizing the burden such a stance places on everyday Americans. “While he boasts about dodging his tax responsibilities, the rest of us carry the weight of that decision. It’s not just a failure of duty; it’s a disservice to every citizen who plays by the rules,” Biden lamented, underscoring the economic realities faced by ordinary citizens.

As the event progressed, Biden made it clear that the upcoming election presents a definitive choice for voters. He articulated a strong endorsement of Hillary Clinton, emphasizing that she embodies the leadership and values necessary for the country’s progress. “The choice in this election is straightforward,” Biden said. “We need a leader who stands for all Americans, not just the wealthy elite.”

Biden’s passionate address in Philadelphia served to energize Clinton’s supporters and underscore the stakes of the election. With Trump’s rhetoric under scrutiny and the election drawing closer, Biden’s call to action aimed to clarify the contrasting visions for America presented by the two candidates. 

As campaign season intensifies, moments like this rally reinforce the narrative Biden aims to construct around Clinton, framing her as a candidate committed to the principles of service and integrity. “Hillary Clinton should be the next president of the United States,” he concluded emphatically, reiterating the clarity he believes voters should hold as they head to the polls. 

The Philadelphia event not only showcased Biden’s commitment to Clinton’s campaign but also underscored the sharp divisions that define the current political landscape.",3.0,19.0,496.0,0.17647058823529413,0.006048387096774193,560.0,1.0,0.033928571428571426

At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday.

The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.

Story Continued Below

The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.

The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.

""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""

In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.

“This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

In a startling revelation, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) inspector general has disclosed that at least 858 individuals who were ordered deported have mistakenly been granted U.S. citizenship. This significant oversight is attributed to incomplete fingerprint records, raising serious questions about the integrity of the naturalization process.

The inspector general's report outlines how gaps in both the DHS's digital fingerprint repository and the FBI's records contributed to this alarming situation. Specifically, it was found that the paper fingerprint cards created before 2008 were not consistently digitized, resulting in a lack of comprehensive documentation regarding deported individuals. This inadequacy in record-keeping means that certain deported immigrants could potentially be granted citizenship without thorough verification of their backgrounds.

Importantly, the report characterizes those who received citizenship as ""potentially"" ineligible, though it clarifies that this does not mean they were necessarily inappropriately granted citizenship. In some instances, applicants with similar record gaps have been denied citizenship, while others remain under investigation. This distinction highlights the variability in individual cases and the complexities of citizenship verification processes.

In an unsettling twist, at least three of the previously deported individuals who were granted citizenship subsequently gained security access at airports and maritime facilities. However, these credentials have since been revoked following the discovery of their prior deportation status. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of the vetting procedures currently in place and highlights the potential risks involved in the naturalization process.

Inspector General John Roth emphasized the urgent need for easier access to fingerprint records, asserting that without this access, there is an increased risk of fraud during the naturalization process. The need for enhanced verification processes has been underscored by the DHS itself, which has acknowledged the issue and is actively working to rectify the incomplete records that have persisted for years.

The implications of this report reach far beyond individual cases of citizenship. They reflect a broader need for comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the vulnerabilities in the system. The importance of rigorous vetting for immigrants has been a focal point in political discourse, particularly highlighted during Donald Trump's presidency. Trump notably advocated for stricter immigration measures, drawing attention to the paramount need for effective background checks in response to national security concerns, including terrorism.

While the DHS is taking steps to address these discrepancies, the foundational gaps in record-keeping present a significant challenge. The reliance on outdated systems and practices could undermine the integrity of the immigration system and erode public trust in government institutions. 

As the situation continues to unfold, stakeholders across the political spectrum are likely to scrutinize the measures the DHS implements to prevent future incidents of this nature. Moving forward, the focus will likely remain on enhancing the naturalization process, securing comprehensive digitization of records, and ensuring that adequate safeguards are in place to protect the nation's borders and maintain the integrity of its citizenship policies. 

In conclusion, the findings from the DHS inspector general reaffirm the critical need for an immigration system that is both efficient and secure, highlighting the complexities that arise from population management and procedural adherence in an increasingly scrutinized policy landscape.",-16.0,12.0,559.0,-1.0,-0.028622540250447227,592.0,0.5454545454545454,0.02027027027027027
Real_78-Webpage,Insiders: The heat is on Hillary,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.

Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.

Story Continued Below

That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.

“She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,” said a Nevada Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.”

“The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,” a New Hampshire Democrat added. “Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.”

One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.

“Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the Ohio Democrat. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.”

Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.

“Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an Ohio Republican. “Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.”

“She has to stop [Trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a Virginia Republican. “All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.”

Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans — most pointed to the GOP nominee’s volatile personality.

“Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,” said a Michigan Republican. “The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.”

“The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?” added a Michigan Democrat. “Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?”

Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:

Most insiders expect Clinton to “win” the debate.

Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

“Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,” said an Iowa Republican.

“[Clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a New Hampshire Democrat.

But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.

“The press wants Trump to win,” said a Florida Democrat. “Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.”

Some Republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction.

“The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,” a Virginia Republican said. “But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.”

Insiders think the debate will matter.

Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.

Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle.

“Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a Michigan Democrat predicted. “The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.”

The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact.

“Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.”

But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump’s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.

“If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an Iowa Republican. “If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.”

Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.

“We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,” an Iowa Republican said. “Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.”

Added a Florida Democrat: “Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.”

As the countdown to the highly anticipated first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump draws near, the atmosphere surrounding both candidates is palpable with tension and heightened expectations. Insiders from both major parties have underscored the stakes involved, particularly for Clinton, who faces intensified scrutiny as she prepares to step onto the debate stage.

Clinton’s extensive political history and experience as a former Secretary of State have set a benchmark that many believe raises the bar for her performance in contrast to her opponent. A notable 69% of Democrats and 74% of Republicans believe that Clinton carries more pressure to perform during the debate. The implication is clear: expectations for Clinton are significantly higher, putting her in a challenging position as she seeks to demonstrate her leadership capabilities in the face of a contentious political landscape.

Despite some Democrats' confidence in Clinton's abilities, there’s an undercurrent of anxiety regarding the relatively low expectations that have been laid out for Trump. This disparity has fueled discussions around a perceived double standard that Clinton faces as the first female nominee of a major party in American history. The nuances of these expectations have not gone unnoticed among party insiders, many of whom are concerned that the scrutiny Clinton faces may not be equally applied to Trump.

Republicans, while recognizing the challenges ahead for Trump, also point out the increasing pressures on Clinton, especially as polling numbers have begun to tighten leading up to the debate. The competitive landscape further complicates the narrative, as a significant 31% of Democrats and 26% of Republicans still maintain that Trump bears more pressure in this face-off.

Despite this mixed outlook, a majority of insiders seem to rally behind the notion that Clinton is equipped to ""win"" the debate. A noteworthy 76% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans project confidence in Clinton’s capabilities, believing she will present a strong case that appeals to voters. This anticipation may stem from her prior experiences in debates and her long-standing political career, which many view as vital assets heading into the clash with Trump.

However, not all insiders are so convinced that media coverage will reflect a fair portrayal of the candidates. Skepticism persists among Democrats who fear that the media may show a bias favoring Trump in the narrative that unfolds during and after the debate. This concern highlights a continued divide in how both parties perceive the media's role in shaping public opinion and impacting electoral outcomes.

As the debate looms, insiders suggest that this event could not only alter the momentum of the race but also hold the potential to sway voters significantly. In fact, 66% of Democrats and 52% of Republicans foresee their candidate gaining advantages as a result of the debate. Such optimism points to the belief that the debate could serve as a critical juncture in the electoral process, capable of influencing undecided voters at a pivotal moment.

Still, some insiders express doubts regarding the lasting impacts of the debate, noting the deep polarization that characterizes the current political climate. The unpopularity of both candidates is also a factor, with many believing that the effect of the debate may be fleeting, as voters seem entrenched in their political affiliations. 

As the debate acts as a stage for the candidates to showcase their policies and connect with constituents, both Clinton and Trump will undoubtedly have much to prove. The outcome may resonate beyond the immediate audience, affecting perceptions of voter engagement, trust, and support in the weeks leading up to the election. Following a month of intense political maneuvering, all eyes will be on the debate, where each candidate hopes to make their case heard, understood, and ultimately accepted by the American populace. 

With pressure mounting and expectations set, the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump promises to be a defining moment in the race, reflecting not just the candidates themselves, but the broader landscapes of American political discourse.",43.0,26.0,2576.0,0.8431372549019608,0.016692546583850932,752.0,1.04,0.034574468085106384
Real_79-Webpage,Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

In a recent social media commentary, Frank Wilkenmeyer has taken aim at Donald Trump Jr., characterizing him as unsophisticated in his approach to public discourse online. Wilkenmeyer’s remarks come amidst a backdrop of ongoing controversies relating to the Trump brothers and their antics, which seem to offer an endless supply of material for mockery across social platforms.

One notable instance that Wilkenmeyer highlights is Eric Trump’s public gaffe concerning a crossword puzzle mention that inadvertently put him in a humorous light. The blunders made by the Trump siblings have become fodder for intense scrutiny, with social media users readily capitalizing on their frequent missteps.

Wilkenmeyer draws attention to a specific Twitter exchange involving Donald Trump Jr., which centers around Colin Kaepernick and his protests during the National Anthem. The tweet, reflecting Trump Jr.’s staunch criticism of Kaepernick, accuses the former NFL quarterback of disrespecting military personnel. This sentiment has sparked considerable backlash among conservatives, particularly concerning the broader conversation around athletes' rights to protest issues tied to social justice, including the prominent Black Lives Matter movement.

Conservative voices have been vocal in their objections to the actions of athletes who choose to kneel during the National Anthem, framing these protests as offensive and disrespectful. In light of this, Wilkenmeyer criticizes the calls from some conservatives for severe punitive measures against these athletes, including suggestions of termination from their roles and even imprisonment. Such responses, he argues, exemplify an alarming reactionary stance that dismisses individual expression.

From a liberal perspective, Wilkenmeyer makes a compelling case that athletes indeed have the right under the First Amendment to engage in acts of meaningful expression, even if such expressions challenge conventional displays of patriotism. He vehemently opposes the notion that mandatory demonstrations of allegiance—such as standing for the National Anthem—should be seen as a prerequisite for patriotism. 

“True patriotism does not hinge on outward displays of support or allegiance,” Wilkenmeyer asserts. He suggests that such attitudes are rooted in a limited understanding of constitutional rights, noting that conservatives seem primarily invested in the Second Amendment while overlooking other vital rights, particularly those concerning free speech.

In recent months, the discussion surrounding Kaepernick’s protests has triggered widespread debate on the very fabric of free expression in America. Wilkenmeyer underscores that curbed dialogues often lead to a misunderstanding of patriotism, which he posits should encompass a broader principle of respect for diversity of thought and the right to dissent.

Moreover, he draws parallels with Supreme Court rulings that support free speech across various contexts, underscoring that expressions of dissent and protest are integral to the very essence of American democracy. The implications of this discourse echo across social media platforms where conversations about freedom of expression, civic duty, and patriotism continue to unfold.

In conclusion, as social media serves as both a platform and battleground for these discussions, Wilkenmeyer emphasizes the importance of a nuanced understanding of free expression, cautioning against constrictive viewpoints that may undermine the core values enshrined in the Constitution. The ongoing saga between the Trump brothers and their social media presence remains a vibrant reflection of the complex fabric of contemporary American society—a society grappling with the intersection of rights, patriotism, and the evolving norms of public discourse.",-17.0,-2.0,592.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.028716216216216218,613.0,-0.1,-0.0032626427406199023
Real_8-Webpage,More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump! – Eagle Rising,"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.

The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category.

Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.

Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.

Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.

Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”. Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said.

Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”

In what can be described as an exceptionally fruitful week for Donald Trump, the former president has managed to solidify his position among supporters while simultaneously frustrating liberals and “Never Trumpers.” This surge in momentum has been marked by significant polling gains and the introduction of ambitious policy proposals, which are all framed within a broader narrative of rebirth and resilience.

Recent polling data reveals a positive shift for Trump as he prepares for a potential rematch against Hillary Clinton. The Fox News Poll depicts him regaining ground, with a favorable 46% support compared to Clinton's 45%. This survey reflects a trend that has been echoed by other polls, most notably the LA Times/USC poll, which shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead. Such numbers become critical as Trump eyeing the 2024 election is a reflection of his unwavering appeal to a partisan base that yearns for a return to his administration's policies.

Battleground states, essential for any presidential hopeful, also reveal a brightening picture for Trump. A recent Suffolk University Poll indicates he holds a three-point lead in a key state, while CNN/ORC shows him up by four in Florida—a crucial state that often serves as a bellwether for election outcomes. Although Clinton remains ahead in traditionally blue states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, the narrowing gaps suggest that Trump's message is resonating and that his supporters are mobilizing.

Trump's week of triumph began with a compelling presentation of his childcare policy in Aston, Pennsylvania. This policy package, strategically crafted to appeal to families, proposes significant benefits: six weeks of paid maternity leave for mothers not covered by employer benefits, childcare rebates for low-income families through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) of up to $1,200 per year, and full tax deductions for middle-class families on childcare expenses. Furthermore, the introduction of Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) sets forth tax-free childcare savings options, which also cater to elderly care needs, coupled with tax deductions for stay-at-home parents.

Such measures underline Trump's focus on family values and economic security, highlighting his continued effort to reach out to voters who prioritize the wellbeing of their children. 

Following his childcare policy rollout, Trump furthered his economic agenda at the prestigious Economic Club of New York. This speech not only detailed his visions for the nation’s economy but also provided a platform for him to clarify personal health concerns. Appearing on The Dr. Oz Show shortly thereafter, Trump shared the results of his recent health check-up and strategically shifted the attention towards Hillary Clinton, directly addressing ongoing debates about her health—an issue that has lingered since the 2016 election cycle.

His appearance on The Dr. Oz Show was notably amplified by the participation of his daughter, Ivanka Trump, who discussed the childcare plan and reached audiences with potential voting power. This move showcased Trump's keen understanding of media dynamics and family branding—all geared towards fostering goodwill with critical demographics, particularly women voters.

Trump's penchant for connecting with diverse audiences further manifested during his humorous guest appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. The light-hearted engagement, featuring Fallon playfully tousling Trump's hair, enabled the former president to project a relatable image. This self-deprecating humor is a calculated move, designed to build bridges with millennials and even disenchanted Democrats who may have felt alienated during the last election.

The week culminated in the grand opening ceremony of Trump’s new hotel in Washington, D.C.—a venture that has not only significant economic implications but also symbolizes his ongoing presence in the political landscape. The event received accolades from military leaders, who publicly endorsed Trump's commitment to the armed forces, alongside Medal of Honor recipients, amplifying his connection to patriotic sentiments.

During this hotel ceremony, Trump revisited his controversial “birther issue,” reiterating that President Obama was born in the United States—a proclamation intended to settle lingering criticism of his past remarks. He further credited the inception of this controversy to Clinton's 2008 campaign, a claim designed to redirect blame and fortify his narrative of transparency and accountability.

As the week unfolded, Trump showcased an adept ability to harness media attention through non-traditional campaign strategies. His week symbolizes more than just policy announcements and polling gains; it captures the essence of his approach to politics—engagement through charisma, controversy, and a relentless pursuit of the spotlight.

For Trump, this week stands as a testament to his resilience and strategic acumen in a cluttered political landscape. While liberal critics and detractors continue to hover over his significant undertakings, the former president appears increasingly undeterred, focusing instead on fostering his core support and winning the hearts of undecided voters. As the 2024 campaign season heats up, Trump's multifaceted approach—combining policy innovation with strong media engagement—could well shape the discourse soon to come.

In conclusion, Donald Trump’s remarkable week has fortified his standing as a formidable player on the political stage. By merging substantial policy initiatives with a dynamic engagement strategy, he successfully appeals to a broad voter base while simultaneously challenging his opposition. As states shift into toss-up categories and polling margins tighten, the coming months are set to reveal whether this momentum can sustain itself or will be disrupted by emerging challenges. The unfolding narrative of Trump is one of persistence and adaptation in the face of opposition, echoing the sentiments of a base eager for his return to the White House.",59.0,70.0,1240.0,1.2291666666666667,0.04758064516129032,1010.0,2.121212121212121,0.06930693069306931
Real_80-Webpage,Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground,"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.

Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.

He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.

Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.

Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.

Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.

These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.

Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.

""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.

Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.

Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump.

""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.

Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.

Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""

The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.

Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.

TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.

This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.

""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""

Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""

Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""

""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""

This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.

Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.

According to TVNewser, Wednesday's town hall will focus on ""issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this election cycle.""

According to Nielsen data, only 1.5% of Hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are African American. Overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of Fox News viewers are African American.",http://cnn.it/2dcjQUU,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg,Brian Stelter,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150529102155-anheuser-busch-drinking-water-124x70.jpg,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/authors/byline-icon/brian-stelter.png,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/9.0/sections/media/cnnmedia_color.svg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170828124254-hurricane-harvey-damage-124x70.jpg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160531165528-donald-trump-media-1024x576.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif,https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=731697573629176&ev=PageView&noscript=1,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/logos/cnn-logo.png,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170828120549-whole-foods-price-drop-bananas-124x70.jpg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/sections/media/reliable-sources-cnnmoney.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/logos/money-logo.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif",http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html,"{""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Fox News, media"", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNNMoney"", ""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee."", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""url"": ""http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html"", ""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""media"", ""author"": ""Brian Stelter"", ""vr"": {""category"": ""media"", ""type"": ""Article""}, ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19T06:44:21"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Fox News, media"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 521848191196480}, ""date"": ""2016-09-19 06:44:21"", ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee."", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""url"": ""http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html"", ""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-540x304.jpg"", ""site"": ""@CNNMoney"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""viewport"": ""width=1140"", ""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee.""}","- Donald Trump's media strategy has shifted, focusing primarily on Fox News while avoiding other major news networks.

In a notable shift in media strategy, former President Donald Trump has concentrated his efforts on Fox News while steering clear of other major news networks. As the 2024 election season approaches, Trump's approach seems focused on energizing his base rather than appealing to undecided voters, leading to a deliberate reduction in his exposure to tough questions from the mainstream media. This change has reignited discussions about his accessibility, especially in light of his competitor, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has recently ramped up her own press engagements.

Trump has been a frequent guest on popular Fox programs such as ""Fox & Friends"" and ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" and he has plans for upcoming town halls with Sean Hannity—an influential Trump ally. This strategy appears calculated to deliver his messages directly to core supporters while avoiding the more challenging inquiries that often arise in mainstream media interviews. Surrogates for Trump have asserted that he is more accessible than Clinton; however, this assertion is becoming increasingly contentious as Clinton has held a series of press conferences lately, showcasing a level of media engagement that Trump has notably lacked.

It has now been over 50 days since Trump last participated in a press conference, a development that has drawn criticism from journalists who are increasingly voicing their concerns about the lack of interaction between Trump and the media. Reporters are particularly troubled by his absence from traditional journalistic platforms, emphasizing that he rarely engages in interviews with major newspapers like The Washington Post and The New York Times. Such platforms are typically viewed as vital for reaching a broader audience and connecting with voters who may not be aligned strictly with conservative media.

In a striking contrast, Trump's media appearances have overwhelmingly focused on entertainment shows, further distancing him from conventional news outlets that could offer a platform for more rigorous questioning. His sporadic engagements with networks like CNN and NBC have also been marked by contentious exchanges, leading to speculation about whether this approach is a safeguard against tough inquiries.

The new strategy appears to be an effort to communicate his messages while simultaneously shielding himself from critical questioning that could challenge his narrative. This shift has raised eyebrows among critics who argue that Trump's preference for conservative media stems from a desire to cultivate relationships with figures like Sean Hannity while avoiding the tough scrutiny often found in interviews with more mainstream journalists.

TV networks have expressed an ongoing desire for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton, citing concerns over the expanded chasm formed due to Trump's current media strategy. The dialogue around Trump’s earlier reputation for being accessible has morphed into discussions regarding the nature of today's media landscape and the interplay between politicians and their preferred outlets.

Amidst this media maneuvering, the former president is also planning targeted town halls, including one focused on issues pertaining to the African-American community. These events are designed to further disseminate Trump's messages to specific audiences, ensuring that he retains visibility and support without exposing himself to the rigors of traditional press scrutiny.

Trump's strategy is revealing not only about his approach to communication but also about the current political climate, where media consumption habits are increasingly polarized. By aligning himself closely with Fox News and its viewership, he is reinforcing a dynamic that caters to a dedicated base of support while potentially alienating other voter demographics who rely on mainstream news for information.

In summary, Trump's current media strategy represents a significant evolution from previous approaches, which often included a broader selection of news outlets and interviews. By narrowing his focus to Fox News, he is working to energize his base and maintain control over the narrative while avoiding rigorous questions and accountability from other media. As the landscape of political media continues to shift, observers will be watching closely to see how this strategy plays out in the lead-up to the upcoming election. The intersection of media, politics, and public engagement is being scrutinized now more than ever, as candidates navigate an environment that both shapes and reflects the voter experience.",15.0,31.0,918.0,0.35714285714285715,0.016339869281045753,765.0,1.3478260869565217,0.040522875816993466

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.""

Pence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.

Mike Pence, former Vice President and currently a supporter of Donald Trump's campaign, took to MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" to challenge the validity of a recent Washington Post story. This appearance followed a rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, where Pence further articulated his backing of Trump's allegations concerning inaccuracies reported by the newspaper.

During the discussion, Pence supported the Trump campaign’s assertion that the Post misreported critical information regarding the Trump Foundation. Specifically, he referenced claims that Donald Trump had used $258,000 from his charitable foundation to resolve legal disputes. Pence argued that the Post's reporting contained ""factual errors"" not only in the latest article but also in previous coverage concerning the Trump Foundation.

Expressing optimism, Pence stated he was confident that the Trump campaign would effectively address these inaccuracies and would provide evidence of compliance with the law. He emphasized that the broader context of the discussion should also include scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, implicitly suggesting a comparative examination of both foundations' activities.

When pressed by Williams for specific examples of the inaccurate reporting in the Post's latest article, Pence chose to defer, indicating that the Trump Foundation would clarify these matters in due course. Despite the controversies surrounding the allegations, Pence reaffirmed his commitment to a free and independent press, underscoring the importance of responding to claims that affect public perception.

Real_82-Webpage,Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.

The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

New Jersey State Police

A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.

Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.

One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.

Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

New Jersey State Police

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.

""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""

Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.

Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

New Jersey State Police

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.

Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.

Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.

A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, has been apprehended in Linden, New Jersey, following a series of incidents involving explosive devices placed in New York City and New Jersey. His capture has drawn significant attention to his background and the discrepancies in his family’s immigration timeline.

Born in Afghanistan in 1988, Rahami has a complex immigration narrative. His family claims they arrived in the United States in 1995, a detail that stands in contrast to previous reports indicating a 2000 arrival. This inconsistency in the timeline has sparked interest among investigators and prompted scrutiny over Rahami’s early life in America.

Rahami is reported to have at least seven siblings and is known to have attended Edison High School in New Jersey. According to accounts from former classmates, he was perceived as a quiet yet funny individual. During his time in high school, he fathered a child with his girlfriend, shedding light on another personal facet of his life.

After high school, Rahami sought further education, enrolling at Middlesex County College between 2010 and 2012 in pursuit of an associate's degree in criminal justice. However, he did not complete the program, leaving that chapter of his life unfinished. 

In the years following his attempts at higher education, Rahami found employment at the family-owned fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, New Jersey. While working at the restaurant, he earned a reputation among locals as a friendly figure, often interacting positively with customers. However, the family has also faced legal challenges; in 2012, they filed a lawsuit against local police, alleging harassment over restaurant code violations. This case was ultimately dismissed, adding another layer to the family's contentious relationship with law enforcement.

As investigations into Rahami's background unfolded, authorities began to examine his travel history. Notably, he traveled to Pakistan from April 2013 to March 2014, reportedly to visit his wife and family. This trip has raised questions and heightened suspicions regarding his connections and activities during his time abroad.

Rahami’s record includes a troubling incident in August 2014 when he was arrested for allegedly stabbing someone. However, he was not indicted for that crime, which has prompted further examination of his past behavior. 

His capture on September 19, 2016, was marked by violence. During a gunfire exchange with police, Rahami was shot before being taken into custody. Following the encounter, he was transported to a hospital for treatment. Currently, he is reportedly not cooperating with investigators, even refusing to provide his name when questioned.

Rahami faces multiple serious charges, including five counts of attempted murder. His bail has been set at a staggering $5.2 million, reflecting the severity of the allegations against him. The status of his legal representation, however, remains unclear, leaving open questions about his defense strategy as the case unfolds.

The implications of Rahami's actions have caught the attention of not just law enforcement but also foreign governments. The Afghan government has expressed a willingness to assist the United States in any investigations related to Rahami, indicating the potential for international cooperation in understanding his motives and connections.

As the investigation into the explosive devices continues, the details surrounding Ahmad Khan Rahami’s life—a mix of personal history and troubling incidents—highlight the challenges faced by authorities in addressing domestic security threats while navigating the complexities of individual backgrounds and immigration issues.

The explosive devices attributed to Rahami have cast a shadow over the vibrant environments of New York City and New Jersey, where random acts of violence can create unease among residents.

Real_83-Webpage,Trump’s puzzling pitch to black voters,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

Story Continued Below

The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

“The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

“We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.

But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night.

“I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”

Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach.

“I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?”

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

“Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

“I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.”

Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.”

“The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.”

Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.

“They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”

In a notable step towards bridging the gap with African-American voters, former President Donald Trump held a campaign event at a historically significant African-American church in Cleveland, Ohio. The gathering marked an effort to position himself as a solution to pressing urban issues faced by the community. Trump’s outreach came amid ongoing accusations of racism from his political opponents, particularly from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who has frequently criticized his rhetoric and policies.

During his address, Trump proposed the expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policies, a move that has sparked significant controversy in urban populations due to its association with racial profiling, particularly in black neighborhoods. This proposal was met with immediate backlash from civil rights leaders, indicating a fraught response to the perception that such policies target African-Americans unjustly.

Trump’s visit to the Cleveland church was part of a broader strategy to address some of the nation’s urban issues while revisiting a focus on communities he describes as being in dire straits. He juxtaposed this outreach by also appearing in predominantly rural white areas, seemingly aiming to consolidate support across racial divides.

Highlighting the event was the introduction by Donald King, a former boxing promoter who has had his share of controversies. King characterized Trump as a “gladiator” ready to disrupt the political status quo that he argues has failed minorities. This framing plays into Trump’s narrative of positioning himself as an outsider willing to challenge traditional political norms.

At the Cleveland event, Trump took a definitive stance on the stop-and-frisk debate, endorsing the practice during a town hall discussion with Sean Hannity. He cited the ""success"" of stop-and-frisk in New York City as a rationale for its extension, a statement that has ignited fierce criticism from various factions, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis. Lewis, among others, voiced skepticism regarding Trump's claims about the current conditions facing African-American communities, questioning not only the accuracy of Trump’s statements but also the implications of his proposed policies.

These developments underscore Trump's precarious position among African-American voters. His approval ratings within this demographic have plummeted to single digits, prompting speculation that his outreach efforts may also serve to reassure moderate white voters who might be apprehensive about his broader electoral strategy.

During his appearance, Trump surrounded himself with a diverse group of advisers, indicating an attempt to project inclusivity while advocating for his policies. This move appears to be part of a calculated strategy to address his long-standing image issues in the African-American community.

In a notable moment, Trump condemned the recent police shooting of an unarmed black man, aligning himself with sentiments that decry police violence against minorities. However, he has faced criticism for a perceived inconsistency, as he often defends police actions in comparable incidents. This dichotomy in his rhetoric may serve to alienate certain segments of the African-American population who are seeking more consistent support against systemic issues of police violence.

Back at the church, King reiterated sentiments of minority oppression, imparting a strong message against what he described as systemic injustices. Despite his complicated history and public controversies, King’s presence as Trump’s supporter showcased an attempt to connect with the African-American community on issues of representation and opportunity.

Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, provided further commentary on the accusations of racism leveled against him. Cohen maintained that Trump is not prejudiced, contending that he views all individuals as inhabitants of the “human race.” This defense speaks to Trump’s need to dispel negative perceptions that could hinder his political ambitions, particularly in light of his low standing with black voters.

Throughout the event and in his broader campaign rhetoric, Trump reiterated accusations against Democrats for taking black voters for granted, asserting his commitment to engaging with these communities and ensuring their interests are represented. This pledge, however, is met with skepticism by many who question whether his policies would genuinely address the systemic challenges faced by African-Americans or if they serve to further political gains.

As Trump campaigns onward, his efforts to cultivate legitimacy and support in historically marginalized communities will be scrutinized through the lens of his past policies and statements. His strategy in Cleveland represents a microcosm of the larger dialogue surrounding race, politics, and the potential for meaningful change in urban America. 

While Trump's Ohio campaign stop may have been a tactical move to curry favor in a crucial electoral demographic, the implications of his proposed policies and their reception in African-American communities will be key indicators of his political viability moving forward. Whether voters will be unified by messages of opportunity or further polarized by past actions and rhetoric remains to be seen as the political landscape continues to evolve. 

With critical elections on the horizon, this outreach signifies not only Trump's intentions but also reflects the broader challenges of navigating race and identity within the complicated dynamics of contemporary American politics. The outcome of such strategies, and the extent to which they resonate with both minority voters and moderates, will likely influence discussions that shape future electoral contests and party platforms across the political spectrum.",-67.0,-11.0,1178.0,-1.8108108108108107,-0.056876061120543296,962.0,-0.34375,-0.011434511434511435

Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged.

“If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.”

Story Continued Below

Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.”

Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.

But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.”

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.”

Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.

Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.

“I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.”

He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.

“I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.

Joe Arpaio, the controversial former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, weighed in on Donald Trump’s recent comments regarding Barack Obama’s birthplace, suggesting that there are still unresolved questions despite Trump’s acknowledgment. Arpaio noted that Trump did not affirm the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate, portraying this ambiguity as an opportunity for the “birther” movement to persist.

In response to Trump’s statement, Arpaio remarked, “It didn’t bother me.” His comment reflects a nuanced view of Trump’s approach to the birther controversy, which remains a contentious issue in American politics. The former sheriff, known for his hard-line stance on immigration, initially sparked the birther debate in August 2011, when he launched an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate after it was made public by the White House.

Trump, who rose to political prominence by suggesting that Obama was not born in the United States, has faced significant backlash, with critics labeling his comments as racially charged and inappropriate. Recently, during a press conference, Trump appeared to backtrack on his previous allegations, trying to shift the responsibility for the birther narrative onto Hillary Clinton, claiming she was the first to question Obama’s place of birth.

Despite Trump’s attempt to distance himself from the birther claims, Arpaio continues to maintain that Obama’s birth certificate is fraudulent. His investigation remains active, although he has not provided tangible evidence to substantiate his claims. Arpaio insisted that the inquiry centers on the validity of the birth certificate itself, avoiding any discussion of Obama’s actual birthplace. He vehemently denied any racist motivations behind his actions, stating, ""I have no idea now where he was born.”

The persistence of the birther theme in political discourse comes at a time when the nation grapples with deepening divisions. Arpaio’s remarks serve as a reminder that questions surrounding Obama’s legitimacy as president have not entirely dissipated, even with Trump’s shift in narrative.

Arpaio's ongoing investigation has faced criticism for lacking transparency, and the former sheriff remains reticent about the specifics of the findings. He reiterated that nothing so far indicates the birth certificate is legitimate, casting a long shadow over the conclusions drawn by many who accepted the document as valid for years.

The implications of Arpaio's insights into Trump’s recent statements could extend beyond mere commentary. As Trump continues to navigate a complicated political landscape, figures like Arpaio remind supporters that the questions surrounding Obama’s authenticity are far from settled in their eyes.

As the birther movement struggles to evolve amid changing political dynamics, it remains to be seen how this issue will influence the upcoming election cycle. Arpaio’s remarks highlight an ongoing suspense in American politics, where foundational questions about identity and legitimacy continue to fuel divisions and discussions.

In conclusion, while Trump’s recent comments appear to signal a retreat from hardline birther claims, Arpaio and others in the movement find solace in the ambiguity that persists, vowing to keep the topic alive and pressing for answers that many believe have long since been settled. With unresolved doubts still lingering, Arpaio suggests that the issue of Obama’s birth certificate might still have life yet, hinting at future discussions that could evoke the deeply entrenched beliefs that sparked the movement in the first place.",-9.0,-18.0,533.0,-0.5625,-0.016885553470919325,651.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.027649769585253458
Real_85-Webpage,Barack Obama at Benjamin Netanyahu meeting: 'He is always very candid with us',"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month

His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office.

Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency.

""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us.""

That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January.

Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

Real_86-Webpage,McAuliffe hangs with Willie Nelson -- and his weed,"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana

Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert

(CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed.

It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!""

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is.

""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool.""

The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

Real_87-Webpage,The Mystery of Trump’s Man in Moscow: Carter Page,"In March, in a bold “Oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the Washington Post’s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, “I have quite a few more.” The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “Carter Page, PhD.”

Who?

Story Continued Below

Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.”

This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.

“What’s this guy’s name?” says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.

“I had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. “But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘Have you heard of this guy?’”

“Strangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,” Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. “It's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.”

Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.

This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. “I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.” As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?

Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (“I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’” says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump’s own campaign.

What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. “He’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,” says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia’s state oil giant. “People really respect him in this industry. He’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials—including Rosneft head Igor Sechin—during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.

Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at Gazprom,” the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in Russia” and an office “around the corner from Trump Tower.”

Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, “Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a “famous American economist” and “adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.”

All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in Trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.

But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to Page’s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.

So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?

***

I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page’s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.

This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.

OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn’t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive résumé.

Page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. “He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,” his bio reads. “He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.”

Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page’s tenure in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.

So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn’t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “I don’t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says Craig . “It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.”

When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page’s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, “I rolled my eyes at that one.” (He, too, said he hadn’t heard of Page until Trump’s announcement.)

Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?

Turns out, they did.

“His nickname was stranichkin,” from the Russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. “It really irritated our team,” Torchinsky told me over Skype. “We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. These guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” As for Page, “He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” Torchinsky says. “When you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.”

OK, harsh. But then I talked to Page’s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. “He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me.

Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says Aleksashenko.

When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” And, says Aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.”

Trump’s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says Aleksashenko.

***

For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,” he wrote. “Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (“Slave; Pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.

His speech in Moscow’s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “For the last 15 years, I’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak Russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: “We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.” Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.

Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. “He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “That blog post about the slaves. That’s just … strange,” says the Council member.

“He’s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. “You’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.”

I should’ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump’s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.

I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page’s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?

But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch’s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “No one let him into Gazprom,” Aleksashenko says. “He didn’t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller’s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.” Another of Page’s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page’s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year… I used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.”

But the meetings did provide him with something else. “Gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them.

After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father’s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from Trump Tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space.

“That’s Carter Page,” says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. “That’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. He’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.”

In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia’s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“I don’t know this person,” said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page’s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. “I give them money, I don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,” he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “Don’t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.”

“You are engaged in onanism,” said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. “It’s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It’s absurd.”

As for the FBI investigation, well, it’s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.” He added, “the story doesn't add up.” What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page’s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.”

I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?

“Who?” says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.

“He has no formal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.

Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks’s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?

One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.

One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump’s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,” Burt told me. “And I told him I’d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I’ve forgotten. He’s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?”

Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump’s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. “If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,” this person told me.

“I’m not answering your questions,” Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “Carter Page isn’t someone I’ve interacted with.” Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: “Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He’s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.”

***

Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“Who?” Maybe I wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.

“I don’t know about his Russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. “Every conversation I’ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” He went on. “I couldn’t name a project that I could connect Carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.”

“I don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but I think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.”

Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, “a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ‘I want to be part of the team,’” says the Trump adviser. And that’s how it happened. “He’s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ‘He’s an adviser.’ And now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.”

Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,” one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,” the Russia specialist recalls. “He didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.”

According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page’s trip to Russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.” But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “It’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America’s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It’s what’s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carré novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?”

This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “If Page using his status as ‘Trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: “Carter Page, Ph.D.” Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.

For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?

There doesn’t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,” Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.

In March, former President Donald Trump stirred the political waters once again, revealing a list of foreign policy advisers during an interview with the Washington Post. Among the names surfaced was Carter Page, noted as the founder and managing partner of Global Energy Capital. Page claims to have extensive experience in Russian investments, positioning himself as a valuable asset within the complex realm of foreign policy. However, as with many things associated with Trump, curiosity and skepticism emerged, igniting a broader discussion about the implications of such associations on national security and foreign policy integrity.

Carter Page's self-proclaimed expertise in Russia quickly became a point of contention. Despite his assertions, many experts in Russian energy and business circles had never heard of Page. This disconnect between his claims and the reality of his recognition within the industry raised eyebrows, suggesting that Page might not be the authoritative voice on Russian affairs that he purports to be. Further complicating the narrative, Page has been identified as under investigation by U.S. intelligence agencies for potential back-channel ties to Russian leaders, reinforcing concerns about his position within Trump's foreign policy network.

The implications of Trump’s choice in advisers, particularly his reliance on relatively obscure figures like Page, lead to questions about the former president's understanding of foreign affairs. Reports indicated that Trump’s foreign policy knowledge has been called into question, often highlighted by noticeable mistakes during interviews that suggested a fundamental misunderstanding of key international entities. The national discourse increasingly focused on the consequences of such a knowledge gap, particularly in matters involving significant global players like Russia.

After being named an adviser to Trump's campaign, Carter Page garnered a level of recognition in Russia, a phenomenon not often seen for someone of his purported stature. Observers noted that he was increasingly described as an expert in the field, a title that many believed was more reflective of the Trump campaign's influence than Page's actual credentials. This newly minted recognition, however, came on the heels of controversial public statements made by Page, including praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and pointed criticisms of U.S. foreign policy. Such remarks inevitably raised concerns, causing many to question his loyalties and motivations.

The investigations into Page’s connections are ongoing, with scrutiny placed on his potential meetings with sanctioned Russian officials during a trip to Moscow. This line of inquiry could have significant consequences, as such interactions may pose national security risks not only to the Trump campaign but also to the United States at large. The complexities of Page's relationships, coupled with the gravity of the allegations against him, make the situation all the more precarious.

Carter Page’s professional background includes time spent at Merrill Lynch, where former colleagues describe him as an average employee. They noted a lack of significant accomplishments or notable expertise in energy matters during his tenure, which further undermines the credibility of his claims regarding his qualifications in Russian investments. This skepticism is mirrored by industry insiders who have dismissed Page's assertions of involvement in major Russian energy deals, viewing them as exaggerated or unfounded.

Despite the doubts surrounding his experience and connections, Carter Page has managed to leverage his association with Trump for personal gain. This phenomenon raises questions about whether Page is genuinely involved with Russian interests or simply riding the coattails of Trump’s campaign for his own benefit. As Page continues to operate within the political sphere, the implications of his actions and the broader network of advisers around Trump remain paramount for understanding the potential risks posed to U.S. foreign policy.

The role of Page in the Trump campaign is also a matter of dispute among various officials within the campaign. Some campaign aides have downplayed his influence, suggesting that while Page may be a name on a list, his actual impact on policy decisions and strategies was minimal. Nonetheless, the ongoing investigations and the intrigue surrounding his interactions with Russian officials raise valid points of concern. Investigators are particularly curious about the nature of these interactions and how they align with the overarching narrative of Trump’s foreign policy decisions.

As the spotlight remains on Page, the article invites readers to consider significant questions about the risk of national security breaches and the reliability of Trump's foreign policy network. With Page's questionable expertise and the ambiguous nature of his connections, the discourse surrounding his role highlights the unpredictability of political landscapes influenced by unorthodox figures. Ultimately, as the investigation unfolds, many will be left wondering how deeply the roots of influence reach and what the consequences may be for the future of U.S. foreign policy.

In navigating through the layers of Trump's network and examining the enigmatic figure of Carter Page, it becomes essential to dissect not only the individual motivations but also the larger implications for U.S. relations on the global stage. The necessity for thorough investigations into back-channel dealings, questionable associations, and the credibility of expertise within foreign policy discussions cannot be overstated as America continues to grapple with its place in an increasingly complex world.",27.0,5.0,6589.0,0.12796208530805686,0.004097738655334649,961.0,0.15151515151515152,0.005202913631633715
Real_88-Webpage,It’s “Trump is HITLER” Month at the Washington Post – Eagle Rising,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post.

On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part,

(…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is.

Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

Six Day’s before Mr. Cohen, another columnist Shalom Auslander wrote, “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles…

Reports indicate that the newspaper has assigned as many as 20 reporters to uncover negative information relating to Trump. This extensive coverage has fueled criticism, particularly after some columnists made striking comparisons between Trump and Adolf Hitler on two separate occasions in September.

In a controversial piece, Richard Cohen described Trump's mindset as ""Hitlerian in his thinking,"" although he clarified that he does not consider Trump to be an anti-Semite. Cohen’s assertions have sparked discussions regarding a perceived double standard, as similar analogies have not been directed at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Adding to the debate, columnist Shalom Auslander has spoken out against the Hitler comparisons, arguing that such analogies dilute the significance of historical events. Auslander emphasizes that linking contemporary political figures to historical dictators can obscure the unique circumstances and horrors of the past.

These contrasting opinions reflect the increasing polarization surrounding Trump's candidacy and the media's portrayal of political figures. While some believe that these comparisons are warranted, others caution against drawing parallels that may undermine historical significance.

Real_89-Webpage,Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore,"2016 Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore The president’s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.

They’re not laughing anymore.

Story Continued Below

Going into Monday night’s debate, Obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.

“I’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “I feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘Breaking Bad’ here. We’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.”

“There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,” said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.

Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He’s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare—support Democrats.

For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there’s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.

“We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. “But we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.”

Trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.

And the result: Trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama’s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.

Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.

“I don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, I don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.”

But they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama’s America.

“I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. “He’s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.”

For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “Trump has shattered that,” Vietor said. “He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. That’s a bad lesson for people to learn.”

According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton’s chances.

“I’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.

Not everyone’s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.

“He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.

And Democrats’ sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.

“The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,” said Earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.”

But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.

“I’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” Papa said, “than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”

As the political landscape continues to evolve in the wake of Donald Trump’s extraordinary takeover of the Republican Party, aides from the Obama administration have voiced a range of emotions that reflect both amusement and anxiety. Initially, when Trump began his rise within the GOP, many of Obama's former aides viewed his candidacy as a comedic turn of events—a deserved downfall for a party that constantly opposed and disrespected the outgoing president. However, as Trump solidified his position, these sentiments transformed into a deeper questioning of public attitudes towards progressive policies championed by Obama, such as the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and rights for the LGBTQ+ community.

Ben LaBolt, a prominent aide to Obama, recently likened the current political climate to the thrilling narrative arc of the television drama ""Breaking Bad."" Just as viewers experienced a shift from laughter to tension throughout the series, LaBolt noted a similar change in the political narrative surrounding Trump. The initial humor associated with Trump’s antics has given way to worry about the possibility of his success in the upcoming elections.

Obama himself has expressed mixed feelings regarding the situation. While he finds a degree of amusement in the struggles faced by the Republican Party, he simultaneously feels frustration that many Americans have not embraced the progressive policies he worked tirelessly to implement. The recent rise of Trump in the polls serves as a painful reminder of the significant divide in the American electorate and points to a potential failure of Obama's administration to connect effectively with a substantial segment of voters.

Current and former aides are voicing concern that Trump’s mainstreaming of racist rhetoric and divisive tactics demonstrates a robust support base for his candidacy, indicating that the race may be tighter than previously anticipated as Election Day approaches. Many aides have started to reflect on the implications of Trump's actions and words, questioning whether the backlash against progressive policies is broader than they initially assumed. With Trump’s candidacy bringing forth various issues, anxiety about his potential success looms large among those who once celebrated the end of his presidency.

Despite the shifting narrative, some aides have rejected the notion of framing Obama’s legacy in terms of Trump, asserting that the troubles of the Republican Party are of their own making. They contend that it is crucial to remember the internal issues within the GOP that led to Trump's ascendance. Nevertheless, the underlying concern remains—what lasting damage may Trump inflict upon the political process? The precedent he sets in political discourse raises questions that could have ramifications for years to come.

Obama has expressed a desire for a more functional opposition, capable of engaging in negotiations on critical issues. He laments the lost opportunities for progress due to political divides, yearning for a moment when political adversaries can work together for the greater good. The schadenfreude among some of his aides is evident, as they observe the Republican Party grappling with the consequences of Trump’s candidacy. They take a measure of satisfaction from the unfolding GOP turmoil, yet it is tinged with concern about the overall direction of political discourse.

In the midst of these thoughts, some Democrats maintain that Trump’s visibility in the national spotlight serves as a testament to the decline of the Republican Party. They argue that his presidency has disconnected the party from previously successful economic policies and mainstream American values. Despite the tribulations that lie ahead, there is an enduring desire among many within the Democratic Party for a more competitive political landscape—one that does not legitimize extremist views or rhetoric.

As America prepares for an uncertain electoral future, the reflections of Obama’s aides provide a unique glimpse into the complexities of contemporary politics. The transformation from amusement to anxiety encapsulates the evolving nature of public sentiment, and the implications of Trump’s rise resonate deeply within the fabric of the nation’s political discourse. The desire for a return to civility and functionality in politics remains palpable, perhaps serving as a rallying cry for those disillusioned by the current trajectory of the GOP and the challenges that lie ahead as the nation heads toward the ballot box.",-9.0,12.0,1354.0,-0.24324324324324326,-0.0066469719350073855,787.0,0.46153846153846156,0.015247776365946633

The incumbent Republican senator is also out-polling Trump. Sen. Johnny Isakson has a 16-point lead over challenger Jim Barksdale, 50% to 34%.

Clinton's strength comes from the Atlanta area, where she leads Trump 55% to 35%. But Trump leads her 51% to 33% elsewhere in the Peach State. She leads 88% to 4% among the state's black voters, but trails 20% to 66% among white voters.

Real_90-Webpage,Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

“Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”

Adding:

“This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”

Chelsea then said:

“Stop telling women to smile. We don’t like that. It’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”

Going for Priebus’ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

“You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.”

And that’s exactly right.

Comedian Chelsea Handler brought renewed attention to this issue during an episode of her Netflix show, where she directly addressed Priebus's remarks. Handler questioned his authority to dictate how women present themselves, asserting that such directives can be seen as inappropriate and a deal breaker in many interactions. Her commentary resonated with a broader audience, reflecting a growing frustration with the social expectations placed on women regarding their expressions.

Handler did not shy away from mockery, taking aim at Priebus’s own smile while delivering her pointed remarks. She further expressed that women will choose to smile on their own terms, particularly as a show of support for Clinton should she achieve success in her campaign. 

The exchange has brought to light the complex dynamics of gender and communication, particularly how unsolicited demands for women to smile can signal a deeper, often problematic, social norm. Handler's remarks have helped amplify the conversation around women's expressions and autonomy, pushing back against the notion that a smile is an obligation rather than a natural expression of emotion.

Real_91-Webpage,Is Donald Trump qualified to be president?,"Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.

H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.”

Likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.

Story Continued Below

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.

But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump’s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?

1. Does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country?

Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump — who swooned after Clinton’s superb convention in Philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.

His resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.

The first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream.

This is not to suggest that Trump can’t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.

Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates — but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care.

The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. “When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.”

Stone argued that Trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.

Trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.

Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD’s Section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?

2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?

Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: “We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.”

That’s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: “For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “Article 12 of the Constitution.” The framers stopped at seven. “He was just listing out numbers,” said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. “I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.”

OK, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “Free Exercise” clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.

3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?

Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.

But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.

Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much).

More serious is the issue of Trump’s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns.

This isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.

4. What’s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there’s the matter of Trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In exposé after exposé, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.

The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.

5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.

But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.

Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary” in Trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.

But it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially George W. Bush’s claims about Iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read POLITICO’s comprehensive “Donald Trump’s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths” for a taste.)

In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “Clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…”

But getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. It’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.

- Despite being the most unpopular candidate, Trump has seen a resurgence in polls, indicating dissatisfaction among voters, especially in the white working-class demographic.
- Key questions Trump must address include:
  1. Does he know basic information necessary to run the country?
  2. Does he respect the principles of American Constitutional government?
  3. Why won't he answer questions about his businesses and debts?

As the inaugural presidential debate approaches, all eyes are on Donald Trump, who is receiving heightened scrutiny as he stands before the nation, akin to a candidate in a high-stakes job interview. The debate not only represents his opportunity to demonstrate his qualifications for the presidency but also raises significant questions about his readiness for one of the most demanding jobs in the world. Given Trump's unique style and the contrasting expectations placed on him, the debate promises to be both revealing and consequential.

Trump has often been characterized as an opaque candidate. His campaign has leaned heavily on humor and his celebrity persona, seemingly overshadowing the need for substantive knowledge about pressing national and global issues. This superficial approach has led many to wonder if he possesses the depth of understanding required to govern effectively. It is this very aspect of his campaign that raises alarms as he prepares to face not only the electorate but also seasoned political adversaries.

On the opposite end of the arena stands Hillary Clinton, who must also rise to the occasion and prove that she can effectively challenge Trump. In this high-pressure environment, she must address not only her own qualifications but also mitigate concerns regarding her integrity. The stakes are exceptionally high for both candidates, as voters seek clarity in a time of increasing uncertainty.

While Trump’s celebrity status has captivated many, it is important to note his previous performances, which have cast doubt on his competency. Observers have noted moments where he appeared to lack a foundational grasp of basic domestic and foreign affairs, prompting concerns over whether he possesses the requisite knowledge to navigate the complexities of the nation's governance.

Despite being one of the most unpopular candidates in modern presidential history, Trump has inexplicably witnessed a resurgence in opinion polls. This uptick signifies a growing dissatisfaction among the electorate, particularly within the white working-class demographic. These voters, often feeling disenchanted with the political status quo, are turning to Trump and supporting his unconventional candidacy.

In light of this, there are critical questions that Trump must address during the debate, which will not only reflect on his candidacy but will also echo in the minds of potential voters. Important inquiries include:

1. **Does he know basic information necessary to run the country?**
2. **Does he respect the principles of American Constitutional government?**
3. **Why won't he answer questions about his businesses and debts?**
4. **What is the status of his charitable foundation?**
5. **Why does he have a pattern of lying and misrepresenting facts?**

Each of these questions encapsulates essential concerns that merit attention. The first query speaks to fundamental knowledge; being president requires a command of significant details affecting national interest and safety. The second question touches upon Trump's adherence to the Constitution, which is crucial for any candidate, as the presidency is fundamentally tied to the rule of law and democratic principles.

Further complicating his position are inquiries into his business dealings and debts. Trump's reluctance to transparent responses has led to an atmosphere of suspicion, which can be detrimental as voters seek accountability. Additionally, as discussions surrounding his charitable foundation arise, the emphasis on financial integrity becomes paramount, as trustworthiness remains a cornerstone in candidate evaluations.

Trump's pattern of lying and misrepresenting facts is another focal point of concern. Throughout his campaign, his behavior has drawn scrutiny, raising serious doubts about his capacity for informed decision-making. Critics suggest that such patterns may suggest not only a penchant for deception but also a lack of respect for journalistic integrity, further eroding public trust.

As the debate nears, the implications of Trump's approach to these key issues come into sharper focus. Intellectual curiosity, or lack thereof, tends to pose a significant disadvantage for political candidates. The expectation is that a presidential candidate should not only have the appetite for learning but also the ability to engage thoughtfully with both domestic and foreign matters.

The interplay between these various components leads to a compelling narrative as both Trump and Clinton prepare for a critical encounter. The debate will not only serve as a platform for the candidates but also as a moment of reckoning for the future of American political discourse. Each candidate's ability to rise above rhetorical flourishes and engage in substantive discussions will ultimately dictate the narrative that follows.

As voters digest the exchanges and evaluate the performances, understanding the implications of each debate on perceptions of the candidates will be crucial. The outcome of this ‘job interview’ will resonate beyond the stage and into the heart of the electorate as they weigh their choices in the lead-up to the election.

In conclusion, the first presidential debate is poised to be a significant milestone in the campaign, providing a lens through which voters can scrutinize the candidates' qualifications. With Trump’s candidacy raising numerous questions about his understanding of governance and integrity, it becomes essential for him to respond with clarity and substance. Conversely, Clinton's performance will also be vital in reinforcing her credibility and positioning as a viable alternative to Trump. As the nation awaits, the outcome of this critical event may well shape the trajectory of the 2016 presidential election.",18.0,31.0,2547.0,0.21686746987951808,0.007067137809187279,1002.0,0.6595744680851063,0.03093812375249501
