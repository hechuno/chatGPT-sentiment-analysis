Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Former President Bill Clinton's recent remarks regarding donors to the Clinton Foundation have ignited a firestorm of negative headlines, drawing parallels to accusations made by Donald Trump. The controversy centers around Clinton's acknowledgment that while foundation donors may seek favors, it does not guarantee that those requests will be fulfilled. This statement has been interpreted by some as a suggestion of a pay-to-play scenario, echoing Trump's long-standing allegations against the Clinton family.

In an interview with NPR, Clinton sought to clarify his position, emphasizing that the mere act of asking for favors does not equate to receiving them. This distinction, however, has not quelled the backlash. Critics have seized upon the implications of his comments, framing them within the context of Trump's accusations that the Clinton Foundation operates as a vehicle for political favors. The headline surrounding Clinton's statement has further fueled this narrative, suggesting a troubling intersection of philanthropy and politics.

Adding to the complexity of the situation are leaked emails that indicate some donors to the Clinton Foundation were granted meetings with Clinton and other officials. While these revelations have raised eyebrows, they have not produced concrete evidence of a pay-to-play arrangement. The lack of definitive proof has led some analysts to argue that the media's portrayal of the situation may be overly sensationalized.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump's own charitable foundation has come under intense scrutiny. Reports indicate that Trump has not personally donated to his foundation since 2008, raising questions about his commitment to charitable giving. Furthermore, allegations have surfaced suggesting that Trump misused charity funds for personal purchases, prompting an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. This investigation has cast a shadow over Trump's philanthropic practices, yet it has not garnered the same level of media attention as Clinton's comments.

Media watchdog group Media Matters has pointed out what it perceives as a double standard in the media's coverage of the two political figures. According to their analysis, recent reporting has disproportionately focused on Clinton's health issues, diverting attention from significant developments regarding Trump's charitable foundation. This perceived bias in coverage is believed to be detrimental to Clinton's campaign while inadvertently benefiting Trump.

The implications of this media landscape are significant as both candidates vie for public support in a highly polarized political environment. Clinton's remarks about foundation donors have opened the door for renewed scrutiny of her past, while Trump's own charitable practices remain a contentious topic. The contrasting narratives surrounding the two candidates highlight the challenges they face in navigating public perception.

As the election cycle progresses, the interplay between media coverage and public opinion will continue to shape the political landscape. Clinton's attempts to clarify her foundation's operations may not be enough to quell the controversy, especially in light of the ongoing scrutiny of Trump's charitable activities. The stakes are high for both candidates, and how they respond to these challenges could have lasting implications for their campaigns.

In conclusion, Bill Clinton's comments regarding foundation donors have sparked a renewed debate about the intersection of philanthropy and politics, particularly in the context of Donald Trump's accusations. While Clinton seeks to distance herself from the notion of pay-to-play, the media's portrayal of the situation may complicate her efforts. As both candidates navigate this contentious terrain, the role of media coverage will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping voter perceptions and influencing the outcome of the upcoming election.",6.0,0.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,654.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, alleging that former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially exacerbating morbidity and mortality risks among vulnerable populations. The report, titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, and it delves into the implications of these actions on public health and the integrity of the Clinton Foundation.

CHAI is widely recognized as one of the most significant initiatives of the Clinton Foundation, aimed at providing support and access to treatment for individuals affected by HIV/AIDS. The report scrutinizes Clinton's relationship with Ranbaxy, an Indian drug manufacturer that has been a key distributor of HIV/AIDS drugs for CHAI. This relationship has come under intense scrutiny, particularly in light of allegations regarding the quality of the drugs produced by Ranbaxy.

Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower and former employee of Ranbaxy, has played a pivotal role in exposing the company's questionable practices. His revelations led to a landmark lawsuit against the company, which ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to multiple criminal counts related to fraud and the distribution of adulterated drugs. The case resulted in a hefty $500 million fine, underscoring the severity of the violations committed by Ranbaxy.

The Department of Justice has indicated that the diluted drugs produced by Ranbaxy posed increased health risks to patients, raising significant concerns about the safety and efficacy of the medications distributed by CHAI. In light of these findings, Rep. Blackburn has questioned the extent of harm caused by the distribution of substandard drugs and the broader implications for the Clinton Foundation's reputation and operations.

The report also highlights the connections between Bill Clinton and several controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These ties raise further questions about the oversight and accountability mechanisms in place within the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives.

Ranbaxy's quality control issues have been well-documented, with the FDA issuing multiple warnings regarding the potency and safety of its drugs. Despite these serious concerns and Ranbaxy's subsequent ban from the U.S. market, CHAI continued to distribute its HIV/AIDS drugs internationally, a decision that has drawn criticism from various quarters.

Thakur, now a public health activist, has been vocal in his criticism of the Clinton Foundation, particularly regarding its failure to adequately address the quality of the drugs it distributed. His insights shed light on the potential consequences of the foundation's actions on the health and well-being of individuals relying on these medications.

CHAI was part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it became a separate entity. However, it continues to collaborate closely with the Foundation, raising questions about the ongoing influence of the Clinton Foundation on CHAI's operations and decision-making processes. The report suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards for HIV/AIDS drugs through a 2000 executive order, further complicating the narrative surrounding the distribution of these medications.

The initiative began distributing generic HIV drugs from several foreign manufacturers, including Ranbaxy, in 2003. This move was intended to increase access to life-saving medications for those affected by HIV/AIDS, particularly in resource-limited settings. However, the congressional study raises concerns about potential corruption and the financial benefits that the Clinton Foundation may have derived from these partnerships.

Rep. Blackburn has expressed particular concern over the emotional impact on healthcare workers and patients due to the false hopes created by the Clinton Foundation's initiatives. The distribution of substandard drugs not only jeopardizes the health of individuals but also undermines the trust that communities place in healthcare systems and organizations aimed at providing support.

As the report continues to circulate, it is likely to provoke further debate and scrutiny regarding the practices of the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives. The implications of these allegations extend beyond the foundation itself, touching on broader issues of accountability, transparency, and the ethical responsibilities of organizations involved in global health initiatives.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report raises serious allegations against the Clinton Health Access Initiative, questioning the quality of HIV/AIDS drugs distributed in sub-Saharan Africa and the potential consequences for public health. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how these revelations will impact the legacy of Bill Clinton and the ongoing work of the Clinton Foundation in addressing global health challenges. The findings underscore the critical importance of maintaining rigorous quality standards in the distribution of medications, particularly in regions where access to healthcare is already limited.",-6.0,-13.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,855.0,-0.4482758620689655,-0.0152046783625731
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The incident raised immediate concerns about her health and well-being, prompting a wave of speculation among observers and political commentators alike.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton made an unexpected appearance at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment. However, those who saw her noted a striking transformation. Clinton appeared noticeably different—more energetic and lighter in demeanor. This change in appearance has led to discussions about the authenticity of the individual seen in the apartment, with some observers suggesting that she may not be the same person who collapsed earlier that day.

One of the most talked-about aspects of this transformation is the noticeable difference in Clinton's nose. Observers have pointed out that the nose of the individual who appeared at Chelsea's apartment resembles a Roman-type nose, while the Hillary Clinton known to the public has a distinctly Nordic nose. This discrepancy has fueled speculation that the person seen after the collapse may be a double or a ""clone"" of the former First Lady.

Further adding to the intrigue, the individual who appeared at Chelsea's apartment seemed to exhibit a more youthful appearance, lacking a prominent mole above the right lip that has long been associated with the real Hillary Clinton. This absence has led to questions about whether the person seen in the apartment is indeed the same Hillary Clinton who has been a fixture in American politics for decades.

As the political landscape heats up with the upcoming debates against Donald Trump, observers are left wondering whether the real Hillary Clinton will be able to participate. The speculation surrounding her health and the possibility of a double raises concerns about her ability to engage in the rigorous demands of a presidential campaign. Signs to watch for include any noticeable changes in her appearance—if she appears thinner, younger, or healthier, it may suggest the presence of a double.

The implications of this scenario extend beyond Clinton herself. Concerns have been raised about the potential for the real Hillary Clinton to be sidelined from her own administration if elected. The idea that a double could conduct all public appearances and official duties has sparked a broader conversation about the authenticity of political figures in the modern age.

This situation has led to a wave of speculation not only about Clinton but also about other prominent political figures, including former President Barack Obama. The notion that public personas may not always align with the individuals behind them raises questions about transparency and authenticity in politics.

As the political climate continues to evolve, the implications of Clinton's collapse and subsequent appearance will likely remain a topic of discussion. The views expressed in this article reflect the author's perspective and do not necessarily represent the opinions of EagleRising.com.

In a world where public figures are often scrutinized under a microscope, the events surrounding Hillary Clinton's recent health scare serve as a reminder of the complexities and challenges faced by those in the political arena. As the nation watches closely, the unfolding narrative will undoubtedly shape the discourse leading up to the upcoming debates and beyond. Whether the real Hillary Clinton will emerge to face her political opponents or if the public will continue to question the authenticity of her appearances remains to be seen.",8.0,12.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,626.0,0.5,0.019169329073482427
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In the landscape of American politics, few figures have sparked as much debate and controversy as Donald Trump. His statements regarding immigration and terrorism have drawn both fervent support and vehement opposition, raising questions about the implications of his rhetoric on national security and civil rights.

One of Trump's most contentious proposals is the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, aimed at keeping out immigrants whom he has labeled as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" This characterization has been criticized for its sweeping generalizations and for fostering a climate of fear and division. Trump's approach to immigration is not merely about physical barriers; it extends to his views on the Muslim community in the United States.

In a move that has alarmed many, Trump has suggested the creation of a national registry for Muslims. This proposal has drawn comparisons to historical actions taken against Jews in Nazi Germany, prompting concerns about the potential for discrimination and the erosion of civil liberties. Such rhetoric raises significant questions about the values that underpin American democracy and the treatment of minority communities.

Trump's stance on terrorism is equally controversial. He has advocated for extreme measures, including the idea of killing the families of terrorists. This perspective not only raises ethical concerns but also challenges the principles of justice and due process. Critics argue that such actions could lead to further radicalization and violence, undermining the very security Trump claims to seek.

The former president's Senior Communications Advisor has stated that Trump is focused on combating the ""narratives"" of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton rather than addressing terrorism itself. This focus on political narratives over substantive policy raises questions about the effectiveness of Trump's proposed strategies in combating real threats. Critics contend that this approach may distract from the complexities of terrorism and the multifaceted nature of national security.

Trump has been vocal in his criticism of the Obama administration, particularly regarding immigration policies. He has accused the administration of allowing immigrants from dangerous countries to gain U.S. citizenship and of increasing the number of Syrian refugees. In his view, these policies have contributed to a growing threat of radical Islamic terrorism, which he claims has escalated under the leadership of Obama and Clinton. Trump asserts that these leaders do not instill fear in enemies like ISIS, suggesting a need for a more aggressive stance.

Moreover, Trump has expressed a belief that Muslims should take responsibility for reporting suspicious individuals within their communities. This implication raises concerns about the potential for stigmatization and the pressure it places on Muslim Americans. Critics argue that such rhetoric could foster an environment of mistrust and fear, leading to further alienation of a community that is already grappling with the challenges of discrimination and prejudice.

As the political landscape evolves, there are growing concerns about how Trump would define terrorism and the potential for mass actions against Muslims during his presidency. The implications of his rhetoric could lead to policies that disproportionately affect minority communities, raising alarms about civil rights and the rule of law.

Recent attacks in New York and New Jersey, which were committed by an American citizen, highlight the complexity of rights and citizenship in the context of national security. These incidents serve as a reminder that the threat of terrorism is not confined to any one group or ideology, and that a nuanced understanding of the issue is essential for effective policy-making.

The author of this article warns against the implications of Trump's rhetoric, suggesting that if he were to assume office, the consequences could be severe. The potential for increased discrimination, violence, and the erosion of civil liberties looms large, raising the stakes for the upcoming election.

In light of these concerns, there is a call to action for voters to participate in the upcoming election. Engaging in the democratic process is crucial to ensuring that the values of inclusivity, justice, and equality are upheld. The stakes are high, and the future of American society may depend on the choices made at the ballot box.

As the nation approaches the election, the discourse surrounding immigration and terrorism will undoubtedly continue to evolve. The challenge lies in navigating these complex issues while upholding the principles that define the United States. The rhetoric of candidates like Trump serves as a litmus test for the values that Americans hold dear, and the choices made in the coming months will shape the future of the nation for years to come.",-71.0,-29.0,888.0,-2.2903225806451615,-0.07995495495495496,840.0,-0.8529411764705882,-0.034523809523809526

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, promoting the concept of One World Government and globalization.

Acknowledging the complexities of globalism, he noted the ""collision of cultures"" that has emerged as a result. Despite these challenges, Obama pointed out that violence and poverty are currently at historic lows, underscoring the importance of recognizing past achievements to foster continued progress.

However, he also called for a ""course correction"" in the trajectory of global integration, highlighting that advocates of globalization often neglect domestic inequalities and the growing appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities. Furthermore, Obama remarked on the difficulties faced by many government institutions worldwide in adapting to the rapid changes brought about by globalization.

His speech served as a reminder of the need for a balanced approach to globalization, one that acknowledges both its benefits and the challenges it presents.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have emerged regarding potential pay-to-play corruption involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the foundation's financial practices and its true purpose. The Clinton campaign has initially responded to these allegations by emphasizing the charitable work of the foundation, which has been a focal point of its public image.

However, critics argue that the Clinton Foundation has primarily functioned as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates rather than as a genuine charitable organization. This perspective is bolstered by troubling financial data from the foundation's 2014 IRS filings, which reveal a stark contrast between its reported charitable contributions and its overall expenditures.

In 2014, the Clinton Foundation allocated a mere 5.7% of its budget to charitable grants. The foundation's total spending for that year reached nearly $91.3 million, yet less than $5.2 million was directed towards charity. This raises significant concerns about the foundation's commitment to its stated mission of philanthropy.

A closer examination of the foundation's financial breakdown reveals that a substantial portion of its budget was devoted to salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, totaling $34.8 million. Additionally, the foundation incurred $50.4 million in ""other expenses,"" which further complicates the narrative of a charity focused on altruism. Notably, charitable spending saw a dramatic decrease of 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite the foundation receiving an additional $30 million in revenue.

The increase in salaries and other expenses by $5 million in 2014 has led to further scrutiny of the foundation's financial priorities. Critics contend that these figures suggest a misalignment between the foundation's purported charitable goals and its actual financial practices.

The implications of these findings are significant, as they suggest that the Clinton Foundation may have been primarily a means for the Clintons to generate wealth. Allegations have surfaced that Hillary Clinton leveraged her position as Secretary of State for financial gain, raising ethical questions about the intersection of politics and personal profit.

As the controversy continues to unfold, the Clinton Foundation's financial practices remain under the microscope, with critics calling for greater transparency and accountability. The ongoing debate highlights the complexities of charitable organizations and the potential for conflicts of interest in political spheres.",25.0,17.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,429.0,1.0625,0.039627039627039624
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

During that event, Clinton was seen convulsing and required assistance to enter her van, prompting widespread speculation about her health.

Initially, her campaign attributed the episode to the heat, but it was later revealed that the temperature in New York City was a mild 74 degrees. Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment, passing several hospitals en route, which raised further questions about her condition.

As Clinton took the stage in Greensboro, doubts emerged regarding the authenticity of the rally. Observers noted unusual camera placements directed at the audience, leading to suspicions that the event may have been staged to project an image of recovery. Additional videos surfaced, providing analysis that suggested the rally could have been faked.

However, a C-Span video was referenced to confirm that the footage from the rally was not doctored, adding a layer of complexity to the ongoing debate about Clinton's health and the nature of her public appearances. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of this rally and the surrounding circumstances remain a topic of interest among supporters and critics alike.",4.0,1.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,243.0,0.1111111111111111,0.00411522633744856
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the film industry gears up for the release of the fictional movie ""Weekend at Chelsea's,"" the narrative surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and her portrayal in the media has become a focal point of discussion. The film, which is expected to blend humor with serious undertones, reflects a growing concern about the former Secretary of State's well-being and the media's role in shaping public perception.

Critics have long pointed to what they perceive as the media's unwavering support for Clinton, suggesting that this allegiance may lead to a downplaying of serious health issues. This sentiment has been echoed by various commentators who argue that the media's protective stance could obscure the truth about Clinton's health, raising questions about transparency and accountability.

There are claims circulating that Clinton is severely ill, with some dismissing these concerns as mere ""conspiracy theories."" However, the persistence of these claims has fueled speculation and debate. A traveling physician, along with a so-called ""mystery man,"" has reportedly been present during Clinton's medical emergencies since 2003, further adding to the intrigue surrounding her health.

Speculation about Clinton's medical condition has intensified, with some suggesting that she may be suffering from seizures and possibly Parkinson's disease. Observers have pointed to her symptoms and medical history as evidence supporting these claims. This speculation has not only raised eyebrows but has also led to accusations of dishonesty regarding her health, reinforcing a growing public distrust in her fitness for the presidency.

As Clinton's poll numbers continue to decline, the situation has been exacerbated by her controversial remarks about Trump supporters. These comments have not only alienated a segment of the electorate but have also contributed to the narrative that her political career may be nearing its end. The combination of declining popularity and health concerns has created a precarious situation for the former First Lady.

Moreover, Clinton's statements about racism have drawn scrutiny, with critics highlighting perceived hypocrisy in her remarks. Many have pointed to her past associations and actions, suggesting that her current stance may not align with her history. This dissonance has further complicated her public image and has led to increased skepticism about her motivations and integrity.

Despite the political disagreements that many may have with Clinton, there is a palpable sense of mixed feelings regarding her health struggles. While some may relish in the political ramifications of her situation, there remains a level of compassion for her personal challenges. The complexities of her health issues evoke a sense of empathy, even among those who may not support her politically.

As the narrative unfolds, it appears that Clinton's political career may be approaching a significant turning point. While the public discourse is rife with speculation and criticism, there is also a collective hope for her well-being in her private life. The anticipation surrounding ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" serves as a reminder of the intricate relationship between health, media portrayal, and public perception in the realm of politics.

In conclusion, the film ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" encapsulates the ongoing dialogue about Hillary Clinton's health and the media's role in shaping that narrative. As the public grapples with the complexities of her situation, it is essential to approach the topic with a nuanced understanding, recognizing the interplay between personal struggles and political realities.

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant farewell address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama expressed deep concerns about the ongoing battle against ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. His remarks underscored a stark reality: the limitations of U.S. military power in effectively combating these threats, which he characterized as a ""JV team"" in the broader context of global terrorism.

During his address, Obama candidly stated that the United States has little chance of winning the battle against ISIS, citing the alarming growth of the Islamic State and the increasing number of militants as significant barriers to a viable military solution. This acknowledgment of the challenges posed by these extremist factions reflects a broader understanding of the complexities involved in modern conflicts.

Obama emphasized the necessity for honesty regarding the nature of these conflicts, advocating for a shift in focus from military might to more sustainable solutions. He urged the international community to prioritize diplomacy, aid delivery, and political settlements, rather than relying solely on military interventions. This approach, he argued, is essential for fostering coexistence among diverse communities affected by extremism.

The former president did not shy away from addressing the difficulties of engaging with unreasonable factions in these conflicts. He criticized certain liberal perspectives for failing to recognize the connection between radical Islam and violence, suggesting that this oversight has contributed to the current predicament faced by the global community. By not acknowledging the real threat posed by radical Islam, Obama warned, there is a risk of underestimating the severity of the situation.

In a passionate plea for decisive action, Obama cautioned that inaction could lead to a grim reality, one that would further exacerbate the challenges posed by extremist ideologies. His call for a more nuanced understanding of the threats at hand serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in addressing global terrorism.

As he concluded his address, Obama left the assembly with a sense of urgency, urging leaders to confront the realities of radical extremism head-on. His reflections on the limitations of military power and the need for a comprehensive approach to conflict resolution resonate deeply in a world grappling with the consequences of terrorism and violence.

In summary, Obama's final address to the U.N. Assembly serves as a critical reminder of the multifaceted nature of modern conflicts. By advocating for a shift towards diplomacy and political solutions, he highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of extremism while recognizing the challenges that lie ahead. As the international community continues to navigate these turbulent waters, his insights may prove invaluable in shaping future strategies to combat the rise of radical ideologies.",-5.0,-18.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,499.0,-1.0,-0.036072144288577156
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have shed light on the U.S. intelligence community's early recognition of the rise of ISIS and the potential establishment of a caliphate as far back as 2012. The documents indicate that both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) were aware of the growing threat posed by the militant group during this period.

According to the documents, the Obama Administration allegedly created conditions that allowed ISIS to isolate the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad. Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed has pointed out that the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups in an effort to destabilize Assad's regime, despite being aware that such actions could lead to the emergence of an Islamic State.

The intelligence reports predict that support from Western nations, Turkey, and Gulf states for Takfiri militants would ultimately result in the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. This foresight raises questions about the strategic decisions made by the U.S. and its allies during the Syrian conflict.

Critics have highlighted President Obama's characterization of ISIS as a ""JV"" team, arguing that this dismissive view contributed to significant miscalculations in U.S. foreign policy. Additionally, the failure to maintain a residual military presence in Iraq is seen as a critical error that allowed ISIS to gain strength and territory.

The documents also provide insights into U.S. weapons operations in Libya prior to the 2012 Benghazi attack, revealing that American intelligence was aware of weapons being shipped from Benghazi to Syria. This information suggests a broader pattern of clandestine operations that prioritized concealment over national security.

The report concludes with a stark assertion that American servicemen and women were sacrificed due to a covert Middle Eastern policy that inadvertently contributed to the rise of ISIS. As the implications of these revelations continue to unfold, they raise important questions about the effectiveness and consequences of U.S. foreign policy in the region.",-27.0,-2.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,364.0,-0.16666666666666666,-0.005494505494505495
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The incident raised immediate concerns about her health and well-being, prompting a wave of speculation regarding her future political engagements.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her demeanor and appearance. Witnesses described her as appearing more energetic and lighter than before, leading to questions about the nature of her health and the authenticity of her public persona.

One of the most discussed aspects of her appearance was a noticeable change in her nose. Observers speculated that Clinton may have undergone rhinoplasty, as the shape of her nose appeared significantly different from what it had been in the past. This observation has fueled further debate about the identity of the individual seen in Chelsea's apartment, with some suggesting that the person may not be the real Hillary Clinton.

The speculation intensified as comparisons were drawn between the ""clone"" of Hillary Clinton and her previous appearances. The stand-in reportedly has a Roman-type nose, while the real Hillary is known for her Nordic nose. Additionally, the double appears younger and notably lacks a mole above her right lip, a distinguishing feature that the real Hillary possesses. These discrepancies have led to a flurry of theories regarding the authenticity of the individual who has been representing Clinton in public.

As the political landscape heats up, observers are left to ponder whether the real Hillary Clinton will be able to participate in the upcoming debates against Donald Trump. The implications of her health and appearance have raised concerns about her ability to fulfill her duties as a candidate. Speculation abounds regarding the potential for her double to conduct all public appearances and official duties, should the real Clinton be unable to do so.

The situation has sparked fears among some that if elected, the real Hillary Clinton may not be involved in her administration at all. This notion has led to questions about the authenticity of the Clinton Administration, reminiscent of past doubts surrounding President Obama’s legitimacy. The idea that a stand-in could be managing public engagements raises significant concerns about transparency and accountability in political leadership.

Observers are advised to remain vigilant and look for signs of Hillary Clinton's true identity based on her appearance and health. The public's perception of her authenticity could play a crucial role in her campaign, especially as the election approaches. The implications of her health and the potential use of a double could have far-reaching effects on voter trust and confidence.

As the political narrative unfolds, the views expressed regarding Clinton's health and appearance are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. The ongoing speculation surrounding her identity and health will likely continue to be a topic of discussion as the election season progresses, leaving many to wonder about the true state of one of the most prominent figures in American politics. 

In a time when transparency and authenticity are paramount in the eyes of voters, the questions surrounding Hillary Clinton's recent collapse and subsequent appearance may have lasting implications for her campaign and the future of her political career. As the nation watches closely, the unfolding drama may shape the narrative of the upcoming election in ways that few could have anticipated.",8.0,20.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,637.0,0.8333333333333334,0.03139717425431711
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Expect lots more on this to surface over the next few days.",http://theblacksphere.net/2016/09/breaking-did-hillary-clinton-have-a-nervous-breakdown/,http://theblacksphere.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wikileaks-identifies-parents-of-e1474455470249-1200x630.jpg,Kevin Jackson,http://theblacksphere.net,{'$date': 1474455643000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/x72oBpk9WPI,"http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-helped-up-stairs-610x641.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42879-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Obama-with-other-Democrats-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42875-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/21234-featured-300x130.jpeg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42859-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Podesta-and-Putin-640x480-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Donald-Trump-Thumb-Up-Reuters-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Black-Sphere_Logo_Web.png,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42836-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42862-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42873-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42857-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mattissittingdown-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42853-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/15248-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tribute-flag-shirt2.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42841-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/download.png,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Russian-embarrasses-CNN-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42884-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/36088-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42846-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wikileaks-identifies-parents-of-e1474455470249-1200x630.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1604950746428137&ev=PixelInitialized,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42871-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42883-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/15068-featured-300x130.jpg",http://theblacksphere.net/2016/09/breaking-did-hillary-clinton-have-a-nervous-breakdown/,"{""description"": ""Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

Recent rumors surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have sparked concerns about her mental and physical health, with speculation suggesting she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. A troubling video that surfaced recently shows Clinton appearing to lose control of her eye movements, raising alarms among her supporters and critics alike.

In the wake of the video incident, Clinton canceled a scheduled fundraiser in North Carolina, further fueling speculation about her well-being. Research indicates that Clinton has only one rally planned between September 20 and October 19, with no speaking engagements listed for fundraisers during this period. This stark contrast is evident when compared to former President Donald Trump, who has four rallies scheduled between September 20 and 22, highlighting a significant disparity in campaign activity.

Concerns about Clinton's health have been amplified by reports of an incident where she required Secret Service assistance to navigate two steps, prompting predictions that her health issues may become increasingly apparent and could lead to a potential meltdown. As these worries mount, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly exploring potential replacements for Clinton, indicating a growing unease within the party regarding her viability as a candidate.

While Bernie Sanders has been mentioned as a possible alternative, many view him as an inadequate choice, as he appears disinterested in running for president. Despite the emerging health concerns, the DNC has continued to position Clinton as the primary candidate for the upcoming election, a decision that may come under scrutiny if her health issues persist.

Speculation continues to swirl around Clinton's health, with many anticipating that her struggles will eventually be exposed, potentially impacting public perception of the Democratic Party as a whole. The situation remains fluid, and observers are keenly awaiting further developments regarding Clinton's health in the coming days.

As the political landscape evolves, the implications of Clinton's health on her campaign and the Democratic Party's future could be significant. With the election season heating up, the pressure is mounting for Clinton to demonstrate her capability to lead, while the DNC grapples with the possibility of needing to pivot to alternative candidates should her health continue to decline.",-8.0,-9.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,411.0,-0.6923076923076923,-0.021897810218978103
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

**By [Your Name]**

In the quiet corridors of the White House, a restless night unfolded for President Barack Obama. It was late, and the usual tranquility of the presidential residence was disrupted by an unexpected source: the loud snoring of First Lady Michelle Obama. As the rhythmic sounds echoed through the halls, sleep eluded the president, leaving him to wander the West Wing in a state of melancholy and anxiety.

As he meandered through the dimly lit rooms, a single word caught his attention: ""ISIS."" It was a term that had been circulating in the news, but in that moment, it took on a new meaning for him. Grabbing a Post-It note, he scribbled the word down, unaware that this simple act would set off a chain of events that would change the course of history.

Months later, the scene shifted to the vibrant atmosphere of Coachella, where the pulsating beats of electronic music filled the air. Surrounded by the energy of the festival, Obama found himself lost in thought. The idea that had begun as a fleeting notion in the West Wing began to crystallize into something more concrete: the ambition to start an international terrorist organization. It was a bold and controversial idea, but in the euphoric haze of the festival, it felt like a calling.

Determined to bring his vision to life, Obama decided to become the first American president to establish a terrorist group, which he would name ISIS. However, as he shared his ambitious plans with those around him, he was met with skepticism. Friends and advisors questioned his seriousness, prompting him to seek out someone he believed could understand his vision: Hillary Clinton.

One fateful night, the two political titans found themselves in the White House kitchen, engaged in a late-night conversation that would take an unexpected turn. As they snacked on treats, Obama revealed a shocking secret: he was, in fact, a 97-year-old Kenyan man sent to destroy America. Hillary's reaction was one of disbelief and confusion, leading to a humorous exchange that lightened the gravity of the moment.

""Wait, what?"" Hillary exclaimed, her eyes wide with surprise. ""You’re telling me you’re a 97-year-old Kenyan man? How does that even work?""

Obama chuckled, trying to explain the absurdity of his revelation. ""Well, you see, it’s all part of my master plan. And besides, Bo—my dog—he’s actually a supercomputer. He’s been helping me with the logistics.""

The conversation took on a whimsical tone as they both laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation. In the serene setting of the Rose Garden, they shared ideas about Obama's plans for ISIS, blending humor with serious discussions about strategy. The night air was filled with camaraderie, and the two leaders felt a sense of connection that transcended their political roles.

As the conversation deepened, Hillary proposed a tantalizing idea: what if they waited until she became president to secretly destroy America together? The thought excited Obama, and they both envisioned a future where they could collaborate on their unconventional plans without the constraints of their current positions.

The night wore on, and as they lay in the grass, gazing up at the stars, a sense of understanding enveloped them. They had shared their dreams, their fears, and their most outlandish ideas, forging a bond that felt both surreal and genuine. In that moment, they were not just politicians but two friends contemplating the absurdity of their ambitions.

As dawn broke, the laughter and lightheartedness of the night lingered in the air. They had embarked on a journey that began with a restless night and a simple word, leading to a whimsical exploration of identity, ambition, and the power of friendship. In the heart of the White House, amidst the weight of their responsibilities, they found solace in each other’s company, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

In the end, the story of how ISIS came to be was not just about a president's ambition but also about the connections forged in the most unexpected of circumstances. It was a reminder that even in the highest echelons of power, laughter and camaraderie could emerge from the most unlikely of places.",-4.0,8.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,833.0,0.21621621621621623,0.009603841536614645
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the wake of recent attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, Frank Wilkenmeyer has taken a closer look at Donald Trump's bold assertion to ""destroy"" terrorism in America. This promise, made in the heat of a contentious political climate, raises significant concerns about the implications for civil rights and the treatment of Muslim communities across the nation.

Trump's statement, which includes pointed personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton, reflects a broader strategy of scapegoating political opponents while attempting to galvanize support among his base. By framing the fight against terrorism as a personal vendetta against his predecessors, Trump not only seeks to position himself as a decisive leader but also risks deepening the divisions within American society.

However, the promise to ""destroy all terrorists"" is not without its troubling consequences. Wilkenmeyer highlights the potential for increased profiling of Muslims, a demographic that has already faced significant scrutiny and discrimination in the post-9/11 era. The fear is that such rhetoric could lead to systemic civil rights violations, as law enforcement agencies may feel emboldened to target individuals based solely on their religious beliefs or ethnic backgrounds.

The implications of Trump's approach extend beyond mere rhetoric. The article suggests that his promises could pave the way for heightened surveillance and segregation of Muslim communities, reminiscent of historical practices that have marginalized entire groups based on fear and suspicion. This trajectory raises alarms about the erosion of civil liberties, as the line between national security and individual rights becomes increasingly blurred.

Moreover, Wilkenmeyer warns of the dangers associated with disregarding due process for suspects, particularly American citizens. In a democracy, the principle of due process is foundational; it ensures that individuals are treated fairly and justly under the law. Trump's aggressive stance against terrorism, if implemented without regard for these principles, could lead to a chilling effect on civil rights and liberties, undermining the very values that the nation purports to uphold.

The author draws a stark comparison between Trump's rhetoric and historical fascism, cautioning that such language can have dire implications for the future of civil liberties in America. The invocation of fear and the promise of swift action against perceived enemies can create an environment where dissent is stifled, and the rights of individuals are compromised in the name of security.

As the article unfolds, it becomes clear that Trump's promises are not only unrealistic but also echo past campaign pledges that have ultimately failed to materialize. The notion that terrorism can be eradicated simply by declaration is a dangerous oversimplification of a complex issue. Terrorism is a multifaceted problem that requires nuanced solutions, not just bombastic promises.

In conclusion, Wilkenmeyer's analysis serves as a sobering reminder of the potential consequences of Trump's rhetoric. The promise to ""destroy"" terrorism may resonate with some voters, but it also raises critical questions about the future of civil rights in America. As the nation grapples with the realities of terrorism and its impact on society, it is essential to approach the issue with a commitment to due process, civil liberties, and the protection of all citizens, regardless of their background. The fight against terrorism cannot be won through fear-mongering or the erosion of fundamental rights; it requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach that respects the values upon which the nation was built.",-28.0,-30.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,638.0,-1.3636363636363635,-0.047021943573667714
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

In a stark warning, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has highlighted a precarious tipping point in global security, citing the escalating threats posed by terrorism and hostilities from nations such as the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno's remarks underscore a critical concern regarding the current state of military readiness, indicating that the Army is only capable of addressing immediate needs. He cautioned that any further reductions in military capacity could lead to severe consequences for national and allied security.

The general pointed to a significant disconnect between the current administration and military leadership, attributing this gap to the Obama Administration's historical disregard for military advice and strategies. This rift, he argues, has played a role in the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa, as military insights were overlooked in favor of political agendas.

Odierno did not shy away from criticizing the administration, labeling its approach as marked by incompetence and arrogance, which he claims has adversely affected the careers of military personnel. He described the current geopolitical landscape as a strategic inflection point, with determined adversaries increasingly threatening the security of the United States and its allies.

The Army has already seen a significant reduction in its active force, with a decrease of 80,000 soldiers and the reorganization of its structure, which included the elimination of 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. This downsizing has raised alarms about the Army's ability to respond effectively to emerging threats.

Moreover, Odierno noted a troubling decline in investment for modernization efforts, which has dropped by 25%. This reduction has had a direct impact on critical military programs, including the modernization of infantry fighting vehicles and the development of scout helicopters.

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the November elections approach, the integrity of the electoral process has become a focal point of discussion across the United States. Every state has its own laws governing election methods and procedures, yet concerns have been raised about the potential for illegal activities that could undermine these systems. The National Democratic Party has faced accusations of attempting to manipulate elections through various illegal means, raising alarms among those who prioritize fair and transparent electoral practices.

The author of this piece, identifying as a Christian and Constitutional Conservative, expresses a deep-seated belief that the Democratic Party is pursuing a path toward establishing a socialist dictatorship in the United States. This perspective is rooted in a series of allegations that have surfaced over the years, particularly surrounding the 2016 presidential election. Claims of voter fraud and ballot stuffing have been levied against the Democratic Party, with specific accusations suggesting that these tactics were employed to secure a victory for Hillary Clinton.

In light of these allegations, the author advocates for a series of measures aimed at ensuring fair elections. A key component of this advocacy is the call for proper voter registration processes and the implementation of photo ID requirements. The author argues that these measures are essential to safeguarding the electoral process and preventing ineligible individuals from casting votes. There is a strong belief that the Democratic Party opposes voter ID laws not out of concern for accessibility, but rather to facilitate the participation of those who should not be voting.

Criticism is directed not only at the Democratic Party but also at the broader political landscape, including the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system. The author contends that these entities have played a role in suppressing fair election laws, thereby contributing to an environment where electoral integrity is compromised. This sentiment resonates with many who feel that the current political climate is not conducive to the principles of democracy and fair representation.

As the November election date approaches, the author emphasizes the importance of citizen involvement in monitoring polling places. There is a call to action for individuals to volunteer their time and efforts to ensure that the electoral process remains free from fraud. The urgency of this appeal is underscored by the belief that November 8, 2016, represents a critical juncture for the republic. The author warns that failure to act could result in the entrenchment of what they perceive as Democratic corruption, further jeopardizing the integrity of the nation’s democratic institutions.

In this context, Donald Trump is portrayed positively, with the author highlighting his patriotic mission to ""save the country."" This framing positions Trump as a bulwark against the perceived threats posed by the Democratic Party and its alleged attempts to undermine the electoral process. The author’s support for Trump is intertwined with a broader narrative that champions Constitutional Conservatism as a guiding principle for protecting the nation’s values and institutions.

The views expressed in this article reflect the author’s personal convictions and are not necessarily endorsed by EagleRising.com. However, they resonate with a segment of the population that is increasingly concerned about the integrity of elections and the potential for corruption within the political system. The call for vigilance and active participation in the electoral process serves as a rallying cry for those who believe that the future of the republic hinges on the preservation of fair and honest elections.

As the nation gears up for the upcoming elections, the discourse surrounding voter fraud, election integrity, and the role of citizens in safeguarding democracy continues to evolve. The author’s perspective underscores the importance of remaining engaged and informed, advocating for measures that promote transparency and accountability in the electoral process. In a time of heightened political tension, the call for fair elections resonates as a fundamental principle that transcends party lines and speaks to the core values of American democracy.",-52.0,-1.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,728.0,-0.038461538461538464,-0.0013736263736263737
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the annals of American political advertising, few images are as haunting and memorable as the 1964 political ad featuring a young girl picking daisies, set against the ominous backdrop of a mushroom cloud. This ad, famously approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was designed to evoke fear and urgency, portraying his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a warmonger who would recklessly lead the nation into nuclear war. While Johnson's own policies in Vietnam were far from peaceful, the ad's emotional resonance effectively swayed public opinion during a tumultuous time in American history.

Fast forward to the present, and one cannot help but wonder how a modern version of this iconic ad might look, particularly in the context of Hillary Clinton's current political landscape. The suggestion that a ""Daisy"" remake could be crafted to highlight Clinton's failures raises questions about the effectiveness of her campaign and the potential impact of such a strategy. In an era where political narratives are shaped by rapid-fire media cycles, the idea of revisiting the emotional weight of the original ad could serve as a powerful tool for her opponents.

Rumors have circulated about a potential ""Daisy"" remake targeting Donald Trump, a move that some interpret as a sign of desperation among Clinton's campaign staff. The notion of resurrecting such a potent symbol of fear and urgency suggests that the stakes are perceived to be high, and the need for a compelling narrative is more pressing than ever. As the political landscape continues to shift, the effectiveness of traditional campaign strategies is called into question, particularly in light of the challenges faced by candidates like Clinton.

Voters today find themselves navigating a complex media environment, often struggling to discern the truth amid a sea of biased coverage. This is particularly evident in the case of Ted Cruz, whose recent political shifts have been met with a mix of scrutiny and selective reporting. The media's tendency to highlight certain narratives while downplaying others has left many voters feeling disillusioned and confused. The selective nature of journalism, especially regarding Cruz's past comments about Trump, underscores a broader issue within the media landscape: the challenge of maintaining objectivity in an increasingly polarized environment.

The article critiques the media's role in shaping public perception, particularly its inclination to bury critical details that could inform voters' decisions. This tendency reflects a broader issue within American society—an increasingly short attention span that often leads to superficial engagement with complex political issues. As voters grapple with the implications of candidates' past actions and statements, the media's failure to provide comprehensive coverage only exacerbates the problem.

Moreover, there is a growing perception of bias in media coverage against Democratic and liberal figures, which has contributed to the acceptance of the ""liberal press"" label. This perceived bias raises important questions about the integrity of political reporting and the extent to which it influences public opinion. As candidates like Clinton navigate the treacherous waters of media scrutiny, the challenge of overcoming this bias becomes paramount.

As the upcoming debate approaches, the specter of past moderating mistakes looms large, particularly the missteps made by Candy Crowley during a previous presidential debate. The memory of such errors serves as a reminder of the critical role that moderators play in shaping the discourse and ensuring that candidates are held accountable for their statements. In a political climate where every word is scrutinized, the importance of fair and balanced moderation cannot be overstated.

In reflecting on the criticisms leveled against Hillary Clinton by figures such as Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, it becomes clear that these voices have often been overlooked in current discussions. The complexities of Clinton's political history, including her relationships with prominent Democratic figures, warrant a more nuanced examination. As the campaign unfolds, the failure to acknowledge these criticisms may hinder a comprehensive understanding of her candidacy.

In conclusion, the idea of a new version of the daisy ad that documents Clinton's shortcomings presents a compelling argument for a fresh approach to political advertising. By harnessing the emotional weight of the original ad while addressing contemporary issues, such a campaign could resonate with voters in a way that transcends traditional political messaging. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the need for impactful narratives that reflect the realities of candidates' records becomes increasingly important. In a world where fear and urgency often drive political discourse, the legacy of the daisy ad serves as a poignant reminder of the power of imagery in shaping public perception and influencing electoral outcomes.",-18.0,12.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,856.0,0.41379310344827586,0.014018691588785047

Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there.

In a heated political climate, Democrats have been accused of employing intimidation tactics in response to ongoing questions surrounding President Barack Obama's birth certificate. Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, has labeled these inquiries as racially motivated. However, critics argue that this assertion is a non-sequitur, as questioning the validity of a document does not inherently imply racism.

The article presents several pieces of evidence fueling the controversy. Allegations have surfaced suggesting that Obama's birth certificate may have been altered. Additionally, it has been noted that his social security number was issued in Connecticut, a state where he has no documented history of residence. Compounding these concerns, the hospital cited on the birth certificate reportedly did not exist at the time the document was said to have been issued. Furthermore, the birth certificate itself contains errors that raise suspicions of possible falsification.

Critics of the Democratic response question the absence of an original birth certificate and express concern that accusations of racism are being used to deflect from the lack of substantive evidence. The article also highlights that former President Donald Trump has fallen prey to these tactics, further complicating the discourse.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual, in May 2016.

The police's response highlights a commitment to addressing hate crimes, yet the emotional scars left by such acts of violence can linger long after physical injuries heal.

The attacks have sparked a broader conversation about the acceptance of the gay community in society, particularly in relation to certain religious teachings. The article contrasts the values of acceptance and love within the LGBTQ+ community with the teachings of Shariah law, which traditionally condemns homosexuality. This juxtaposition raises questions about the coexistence of radical ideologies and the pursuit of equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.

Woods' experience serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges that persist in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. The notion that radical Islam and the gay community cannot coexist is brought to the forefront, as incidents like Woods' attack illustrate the real dangers faced by individuals simply seeking to live authentically. As society continues to grapple with these complex issues, the hope remains that understanding and acceptance will ultimately prevail over hatred and violence.",-26.0,-43.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,398.0,-2.6875,-0.10804020100502512
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On Saturday night, a shocking incident unfolded at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, when a man dressed in a security uniform launched a violent attack on shoppers, leaving nine people injured. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" during the stabbings. Eyewitnesses recounted the chaos that ensued as Adan moved through the mall, asking at least one victim if they were Muslim before attacking.

The St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly identified Adan as the perpetrator, leading to a wave of shock and disbelief among residents. In the aftermath of the attack, the Islamic State (ISIS) claimed Adan as one of their own, further complicating the narrative surrounding the incident. This claim has raised concerns about the influence of extremist ideologies within immigrant communities, particularly among Somali-Americans.

The attack occurred against a backdrop of heightened tensions surrounding terrorism in the United States. Just prior to the St. Cloud incident, there were reports of a bomb explosion at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and a separate attack involving a meat cleaver on police officers in New York. These incidents have fueled fears about the potential for further acts of violence and the recruitment of individuals from vulnerable communities by terrorist organizations.

In the wake of the attack, community members expressed their support for Adan's family, describing him as a good man and an accomplished student. This sentiment reflects the complexities of the situation, as many in the Somali-American community grapple with the implications of Adan's actions. The attack has not only affected the victims and their families but has also cast a shadow over the broader community, which has worked hard to integrate and contribute positively to Minnesota society.

The situation escalated when Officer Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer, intervened during the attack. Falconer shot and killed Adan, an act that the mayor of St. Cloud has since labeled as heroic. His swift response likely prevented further injuries and saved lives, highlighting the critical role of law enforcement in such emergencies.

The incident has reignited discussions about the Somali refugee population in Minnesota, which has seen nearly 10,000 individuals relocated to the state during the Obama administration. While many Somali-Americans have successfully integrated into American society, there are ongoing concerns about the potential for radicalization among some individuals. Reports of previous convictions of Somali-Americans for collaborating with Islamist groups have raised alarms, as have threats made by Somali refugees in Minnesota.

The growing strength of ISIS in Somalia, coupled with support from Yemen, has further complicated the landscape. The potential for recruitment and radicalization within the Somali community remains a pressing issue. Notably, three Somali individuals in Minnesota were convicted of attempting to join ISIS, and there have been indications that al-Shabab, a militant group based in Somalia, has been approached by ISIS for potential collaboration.

The political ramifications of the St. Cloud attack are significant, with critics pointing to immigration policies as a contributing factor. Some have specifically criticized Hillary Clinton's stance on immigration, suggesting that her policies would lead to an increase in the number of Muslim refugees entering the United States. This, they argue, could potentially result in more terror attacks, as individuals from vulnerable communities may be more susceptible to radicalization.

The attack has sparked a broader conversation about national security and the need for vigilance in the face of potential threats. As the nation reflects on the implications of the St. Cloud incident, there is a growing call for a reevaluation of immigration policies and a focus on ensuring the safety of American citizens.

In light of these events, there is a strong political statement emerging from the aftermath of the attack. Advocates for a tougher stance on immigration and national security are urging voters to consider their choices carefully in the upcoming elections. The call to support Donald Trump has gained traction among those who believe that his policies will better protect the nation from the threat of terrorism.

As the St. Cloud community begins to heal from the trauma of the attack, the focus will likely shift to addressing the underlying issues that contributed to this tragic event. Community leaders, law enforcement, and policymakers will need to work together to ensure that the Somali-American community feels supported and integrated while also addressing the potential risks associated with radicalization.

The St. Cloud mall attack serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration, community integration, and national security. As the nation grapples with these challenges, the hope is that lessons learned from this incident will lead to a more secure and united society, where individuals from all backgrounds can coexist peacefully. The road ahead will require careful navigation, open dialogue, and a commitment to understanding the diverse fabric of American society.",-72.0,-21.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,910.0,-0.4883720930232558,-0.023076923076923078
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, the term ""everyone gets a trophy generation"" has been used to describe Millennials, often implying a decline in standards for victimhood. This narrative has gained traction in various discussions, particularly in the context of individuals who commit acts of violence while simultaneously portraying themselves as victims of societal injustices. A notable example of this phenomenon is Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the bombings that rocked New Jersey and New York City.

Rahami, who was arrested in connection with the bombings, previously claimed to be a victim of ""Islamophobia."" His assertions were not merely personal grievances; they were formalized in a lawsuit filed against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department. Alongside his father, Rahami alleged that they faced discrimination based on their Muslim faith, particularly in relation to their family-owned chicken restaurant, First American.

The lawsuit, initiated in 2011, accused local law enforcement of subjecting the Rahami family to ""selective enforcement"" and discrimination. The family claimed that their restaurant was unfairly targeted, and they faced racial abuse from local residents, with some reportedly stating, ""Muslims don’t belong here."" These allegations painted a picture of a family beleaguered by prejudice and discrimination, seeking justice against what they perceived as systemic bias.

However, the response from local officials, including Mayor Christian Bollwage, was one of denial. The mayor attributed the complaints against the Rahami family to issues related to noise and street congregation rather than any discriminatory practices. This rebuttal highlights the complexities of the situation, where the Rahami family's claims of victimhood were met with counterclaims of legitimate community concerns.

Ultimately, the lawsuit filed by Rahami and his father was unsuccessful, and the narrative of victimhood they sought to establish did not translate into legal vindication. Instead, Rahami's path took a darker turn, culminating in his involvement in the bombings that would later define his legacy. This trajectory raises critical questions about the interplay between claims of victimhood and the actions of individuals who resort to violence.

The situation surrounding Ahmad Khan Rahami serves as a stark reminder of the dangers inherent in a culture that may too readily embrace narratives of victimhood, particularly when they are leveraged by individuals who ultimately engage in acts of terror. Critics argue that such narratives can obscure the reality of the actions taken by these individuals, allowing them to evade accountability by framing themselves as victims of circumstance.

As society grapples with the implications of these narratives, it becomes increasingly important to scrutinize the motivations and backgrounds of those who commit acts of violence. The case of Ahmad Khan Rahami exemplifies the complexities of victimhood in contemporary discourse, challenging us to consider the broader implications of how we define and respond to claims of injustice.",-38.0,-37.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,532.0,-1.9473684210526316,-0.06954887218045112
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to move businesses if employees don't vote in their favor.

As the political landscape heats up ahead of the upcoming election, a familiar narrative is emerging: employers threatening economic repercussions if their employees do not vote in alignment with their interests. This tactic, which has historical roots, is once again at the forefront of discussions, particularly with the recent statements made by Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s.

Puzder has made headlines for his stark warnings regarding the potential consequences of a Democratic victory in the election. He has indicated that if a Democrat is elected, he plans to fully automate his restaurants, a move he justifies by citing rising labor costs. This announcement has raised eyebrows and sparked debates about the implications for the workforce, particularly for the approximately 20,000 employees under his leadership.

The threat of automation is not new in the corporate world. Employers have historically used the fear of job loss as a tool to sway employee voting behavior. In the past, such tactics have often led to negative outcomes for workers, including job outsourcing and stagnant wages. Puzder’s comments echo this trend, as he aims to influence not only his employees but also other minimum wage workers to vote against their own interests.

Puzder's vision for his restaurants includes an automated model reminiscent of Eatsa, a restaurant where customers place orders via kiosks, eliminating the need for staff interaction. This shift towards automation raises significant questions about the future of employment in the fast-food industry and the broader implications for workers who rely on these jobs for their livelihoods.

Critics of Puzder's stance argue that his opposition to progressive policies aimed at raising the minimum wage is misguided. He contends that such policies lead to job losses, yet many advocates for higher wages argue that they are essential for improving the quality of life for workers. The disconnect between Puzder's earnings—reportedly nearly $4.5 million in 2012—and the stagnant wages of his employees highlights a growing concern about income inequality in the corporate sector.

Puzder's influence extends beyond his own restaurants; he maintains a blog where he discusses politics and capitalism, raising questions about how his views align with those of his employees. The disparity between his financial success and the economic struggles faced by many workers in the fast-food industry underscores the challenges of navigating corporate interests in a democratic society.

As the election approaches, the stakes are high for both employers and employees. Puzder's threats serve as a reminder of the power dynamics at play, where corporate leaders can wield significant influence over the political choices of their workforce. The fear of job loss and economic instability can create a chilling effect, leading employees to vote in ways that may not align with their best interests.

Regardless of the election outcome, Puzder's commitment to automation appears unwavering. His focus on profits over people raises critical questions about the future of work in America and the role of corporate responsibility in a democratic society. As automation becomes increasingly prevalent, the need for a robust dialogue about the implications for workers and the economy is more pressing than ever.

In conclusion, the threats posed by corporate leaders like Andy Puzder highlight the complex interplay between business interests and political power. As employees navigate these challenges, the importance of informed voting and advocacy for fair labor practices cannot be overstated. The upcoming election will not only shape the political landscape but also determine the future of work for countless individuals across the nation.",21.0,5.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,658.0,0.2,0.007598784194528876
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category

In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a significant development in the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, the FBI has announced that it is examining new evidence that could have serious implications for both Clinton and her close aide, Huma Abedin. This evidence emerged during a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Abedin, and has raised questions about the integrity of the previous investigations into Clinton's email practices.

The newly discovered evidence is reportedly located on a laptop shared by Abedin and Weiner, which may contain ""tens of thousands of emails"" from Abedin. Among these emails are those that were forwarded from Clinton's account but were not submitted to the FBI during the initial investigation. The potential existence of these emails has prompted the FBI to reassess the situation, as any work-related or classified content within them could lead to serious legal repercussions for both Clinton and Abedin, particularly if they are found to have lied to the FBI during previous inquiries.

The timing of the FBI's announcement is particularly noteworthy, as it came just 11 days before the presidential election, underscoring the seriousness of the findings. This revelation has reignited public interest and scrutiny regarding Clinton's email practices, which had been a contentious issue throughout the 2016 election cycle.

In July 2016, FBI Director James Comey publicly outlined the evidence against Clinton but ultimately did not recommend charges, a decision that left many within the FBI dissatisfied. Reports indicate that there was a strong desire among agents to revoke Clinton's security clearance and pursue prosecution. This internal conflict within the FBI has raised questions about the motivations behind the agency's actions and the potential influence of external factors on the investigation.

An FBI summary has revealed that a State Department official allegedly pressured the FBI to declassify certain information in exchange for additional agents at diplomatic posts. This revelation has led to concerns about the integrity of the investigation and the potential for political interference. Additionally, the summary mentioned a group of State Department officials, referred to as ""The Shadow Government,"" who were involved in discussions regarding Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests related to Clinton's emails. This group’s activities have further fueled speculation about the extent of collusion to protect Clinton and the White House.

The investigation has also highlighted Clinton's disregard for security protocols. Reports indicate that she ignored security advice that could have endangered both her and her staff, all for the sake of a photo opportunity. This behavior raises further questions about her judgment and the motivations behind her decision to use a private email server for official communications.

Adding to the controversy, a Clinton supporter reportedly donated nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official involved in the investigation. This financial connection has led to allegations of impropriety and has intensified scrutiny of the FBI's handling of the case.

Central to the investigation is Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was identified as having deleted over 33,000 emails from Clinton's server. Combetta was granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the investigation, a decision that has drawn criticism from various quarters. Critics argue that granting immunity to someone who played a key role in the deletion of potentially incriminating evidence undermines the integrity of the investigation.

Leaked emails have further complicated the narrative surrounding Clinton's email practices. These emails suggest that Clinton communicated with President Obama via her private server, contradicting her previous claims that he was unaware of her use of the server. This revelation raises questions about the extent of knowledge and involvement of high-ranking officials in the use of private email for official communications.

Moreover, further leaks indicate that Clinton personally deleted emails and instructed Combetta to remove evidence after being subpoenaed. This behavior, if proven, could significantly alter the perception of her intent and complicate the legal landscape surrounding the investigation. While the lack of charges against Clinton was previously attributed to a perceived lack of intent, the emergence of new evidence suggests that this assessment may need to be reevaluated.

The timeline of events related to the investigation and the deletion of emails is critical in understanding the broader implications of this controversy. Key dates highlight the potential collusion to protect Clinton and the White House, raising questions about the motivations of those involved in the investigation and the integrity of the political process.

As the FBI continues to investigate this new evidence, the implications for Clinton, Abedin, and the broader political landscape remain uncertain. The findings could have far-reaching consequences, not only for those directly involved but also for the public's trust in the institutions tasked with upholding the rule of law. The investigation serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in navigating the intersection of politics, law enforcement, and public accountability. 

As the nation approaches the election, the ramifications of this investigation will undoubtedly be felt in the political arena, shaping the discourse and influencing voter perceptions. The unfolding events will be closely monitored, as the implications of the FBI's findings could alter the trajectory of the election and the future of those involved. 

In conclusion, the FBI's investigation into new evidence related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server has reignited a contentious debate that has persisted since the 2016 election. With the potential for serious legal consequences looming, the situation remains fluid, and the public's interest in the outcome is likely to remain high. As the investigation progresses, the implications for Clinton, Abedin, and the broader political landscape will continue to unfold, shaping the narrative surrounding one of the most controversial chapters in recent American political history.",-6.0,-12.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,1060.0,-0.3157894736842105,-0.011320754716981131
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a prominent advocate for accepting Syrian refugees, has recently faced significant backlash over her open borders policy. This approach, which aimed to provide sanctuary to those fleeing conflict, has resulted in a notable increase in crime across German cities, including thousands of reported sexual assaults and violent incidents. 

The ramifications of this policy have been felt politically, as Merkel's conservative Democrat party suffered a substantial defeat in recent elections. The German public's growing discontent with the situation has prompted a reevaluation of Merkel's stance on immigration. In a candid acknowledgment, she expressed regret over her decisions, stating that the migrant crisis could have been avoided and labeling the concept of multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

During her party's annual conference, Merkel reiterated her previous assertion of ""we can do this,"" but tempered her optimism by admitting that Germany could only manage the situation effectively by controlling the influx of migrants. She warned that continued high levels of migration could overwhelm the country's state and society, highlighting the urgent need for a more sustainable approach.

In response to the escalating challenges, Merkel announced plans to reduce the number of refugees entering Germany. However, she refrained from setting a specific limit on arrivals, indicating a desire for flexibility in addressing the ongoing crisis. Merkel emphasized the importance of a coordinated approach at the German, European, and global levels to regulate and limit migration effectively.

The situation in Germany serves as a cautionary tale for other nations, particularly the United States, as they navigate the complexities of immigration policy. Merkel's experience underscores the potential consequences of open borders and the necessity for a balanced approach that considers both humanitarian obligations and the capacity of host nations to integrate newcomers.

As Germany grapples with the fallout from its refugee policy, the future of Merkel's leadership and the direction of the country's immigration strategy remain uncertain. The ongoing debate reflects broader global tensions surrounding migration, identity, and national security, prompting leaders worldwide to reconsider their approaches in light of emerging challenges.",-2.0,-9.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,403.0,-0.6923076923076923,-0.022332506203473945
Fake_36-Webpage,"DISGUSTING! Because Of Hillary & Obama, NY Terrorist Will Get Better Treatment Than US Vets! ⋆ Freedom Daily","8.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.",http://freedomdaily.com/disgusting-because-of-hillary-obama-ny-terrorist-will-get-better-treatment-than-us-vets/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3895D4C900000578-3798726-Ahmad_Khan_Rahami_28_was_taken_into_custody_on_Monday_after_a_sh-a-65_1474398076306.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a striking commentary on the state of healthcare in the United States, former President Donald Trump has criticized the disparity in medical treatment afforded to a terrorist compared to the nation’s veterans. The focus of his remarks was Ahmad Rahami, the man convicted of planting explosives in New Jersey and New York City, who is set to receive superior medical care than many veterans who have served the country.

During a recent campaign speech, Trump highlighted the privileges that Rahami will have access to, including top doctors, modern hospital facilities, and comprehensive legal representation. This situation has sparked outrage among many who believe that veterans, who have sacrificed so much for their country, should receive equal or better care than those who have committed acts of terrorism.

The issue of inadequate care for veterans is not new. It brings to mind the 2014 scandal at the Veteran’s Administration (VA), where reports surfaced of long waiting lists and cover-ups of inefficiency. This scandal revealed a systemic failure within the VA, leading to widespread criticism and calls for reform. Despite efforts to address these issues, many veterans continue to face significant challenges in accessing timely and effective healthcare.

The statistics are alarming. Over 300,000 veterans have died while waiting for care from the VA, a grim reminder of the consequences of bureaucratic inefficiencies. Furthermore, the issue of veteran suicides has become a tragic reality, with some individuals taking their lives while waiting for appointments, including in VA parking lots. These heartbreaking incidents underscore the urgent need for reform and better support for those who have served in the armed forces.

The frustration expressed by Trump and many others reflects a growing concern over the government's failure to provide adequate care for returning veterans. As the nation grapples with the implications of this disparity, the question remains: how can a system prioritize the care of a convicted terrorist over those who have fought to protect the freedoms of this country?

The contrast between the treatment of Rahami and the plight of veterans serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges within the healthcare system. As discussions continue about how to improve care for veterans, the need for immediate action has never been more pressing. The hope is that the voices of those advocating for veterans will lead to meaningful change, ensuring that those who have served the nation receive the respect and care they deserve.",13.0,8.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,465.0,0.47058823529411764,0.017204301075268817

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a dramatic turn of events in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, played a pivotal role in thwarting a violent attack that left eight people injured. The assailant, identified as a 22-year-old Somali immigrant, launched a stabbing spree that sent shockwaves through the community. Falconer, who was present at the scene, responded swiftly, using his firearm to neutralize the threat and potentially saving countless lives in the process.

Falconer’s actions have drawn attention not only for their immediate impact but also for the broader implications they hold for gun rights and firearms training in the United States. As the owner of Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., Falconer has dedicated his career to educating law-abiding citizens on the importance of concealed carry for self-defense. His commitment to public safety and responsible gun ownership has made him a respected figure in the community.

However, Falconer now finds himself at the center of a political storm, particularly as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sets her sights on the firearms industry. If elected president, Clinton has vowed to target businesses like Falconer’s, aiming to put them out of operation. Her proposed policies include the elimination of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), legislation that currently shields firearms manufacturers and dealers from frivolous lawsuits.

Critics of Clinton argue that her stance poses a direct threat to the Second Amendment and the rights of individuals like Falconer, who have dedicated their lives to protecting citizens. The PLCAA has been a crucial safeguard for businesses in the firearms sector, allowing them to operate without the constant fear of litigation stemming from the misuse of their products by criminals. Falconer’s training company, which focuses on empowering citizens through education and responsible gun ownership, could face significant challenges if Clinton’s policies were to be enacted.

Clinton has faced backlash for her characterization of the PLCAA, with accusations that she has misrepresented the law as providing ""immunity"" to gunmakers and dealers. Supporters of the PLCAA argue that it is a necessary measure to ensure that responsible businesses are not held liable for the actions of individuals who misuse firearms. The debate surrounding this legislation underscores the deep divisions in American society regarding gun rights and the role of firearms in self-defense.

Falconer’s experience as a law enforcement officer has informed his approach to firearms training, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and responsible ownership. His company has become a vital resource for those seeking to learn how to protect themselves and their families in an increasingly uncertain world. The St. Cloud incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers that can arise in everyday life, reinforcing the need for individuals to be equipped to respond to threats.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Clinton’s proposed policies on firearms training and the rights of gun owners remain a contentious issue. Falconer’s story highlights the ongoing struggle between advocates for gun control and those who champion the right to bear arms. With the stakes higher than ever, the future of firearms training and the Second Amendment hangs in the balance, as individuals like Jason Falconer strive to navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing environment. 

In the wake of the St. Cloud attack, the conversation surrounding gun rights, self-defense, and the role of firearms in society is more relevant than ever, with the actions of individuals like Falconer serving as a focal point in this critical national debate.",-11.0,-5.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,672.0,-0.19230769230769232,-0.00744047619047619
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election season heats up, the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has emerged as a significant topic of discussion among voters and political analysts alike. Recent polling data reveals a troubling trend regarding public perception of Clinton's health, with a notable increase in the number of registered voters expressing concerns about her well-being.

A recent poll indicates that over 40% of registered voters now believe Clinton is in ""below average"" or ""very poor"" health, a sharp rise from just 26% in late August. This shift in perception underscores the growing unease surrounding Clinton's health as she campaigns for the presidency. In contrast, the percentage of voters who view her health as ""average"" has remained stagnant at 28%, suggesting that the negative sentiment is gaining traction among the electorate.

The scrutiny of Clinton's health is not occurring in a vacuum. In a parallel development, the belief that her political rival, Donald Trump, is in ""above average"" or ""excellent"" health has seen a slight increase, moving from 33% to 36%. This contrast in public perception may play a crucial role in shaping voter opinions as the election approaches.

Notably, nearly 80% of respondents in the poll are aware of Clinton's potential medical issues, indicating that her health is not just a private concern but a public matter that voters are closely monitoring. At 68 years old, Clinton is perceived by many as looking older than her age, which has further fueled speculation about her health status. Observers have pointed to various factors that contribute to this perception, including reports of her taking Coumadin, a medication often prescribed for blood clotting issues, and her research into Provigil, a drug typically used to treat serious medical conditions.

The concerns surrounding Clinton's health have been exacerbated by public observations of her behavior during campaign events. Many have noted instances where she appeared confused, required naps, or exhibited signs of physical distress in videos and photographs. Such observations have raised alarms among voters, leading to questions about her ability to handle the rigors of a presidential campaign.

Images circulating on social media have shown Clinton being assisted up stairs and needing support while speaking, further fueling speculation about her physical condition. These moments have not gone unnoticed, as they contribute to a narrative that suggests her health may be a significant factor in her campaign strategy. Reports have also surfaced claiming that videos of Clinton passing out at the 9/11 Memorial are being removed from the internet, raising concerns about transparency and the management of her public image.

In light of these developments, it appears that Clinton's campaign may be taking steps to minimize her public appearances. Observers have noted a pattern of reduced visibility, which some interpret as an effort to avoid showcasing her health issues. This strategy, while potentially aimed at protecting her image, may inadvertently amplify public concern and speculation.

Adding to the scrutiny is Clinton's frequent coughing during speeches, which has drawn significant public attention and concern. These episodes have not only distracted from her message but have also led to further questions about her overall health and stamina as a candidate.

As the election draws nearer, the implications of these health-related perceptions could be profound. Voter confidence in a candidate's ability to serve effectively is often closely tied to their perceived health and vitality. With Clinton facing increasing scrutiny, her campaign will need to address these concerns head-on to reassure voters of her capability to lead.

In conclusion, the growing concerns about Hillary Clinton's health are becoming a defining issue in the current presidential election landscape. With over 40% of voters expressing doubts about her well-being, and contrasting perceptions of her rival's health, the narrative surrounding Clinton's health could significantly impact her campaign. As voters continue to scrutinize her public appearances and health status, the former Secretary of State faces the challenge of not only addressing these concerns but also demonstrating her readiness to take on the responsibilities of the presidency.",-11.0,21.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,772.0,0.75,0.027202072538860103

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle, a former high school sweetheart of Bill Clinton, has unveiled a controversial tell-all book titled ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which offers a scathing portrayal of both Bill and Hillary Clinton. The book delves into Hillary's alleged aggressive demeanor towards individuals she considers beneath her, painting a picture of a woman with a pronounced sense of superiority.

Kyle shares a series of personal anecdotes that highlight the couple's attitudes and behaviors during their time in Arkansas. One particularly striking incident recounted in the book involves Hillary making derogatory remarks about developmentally challenged children during an Easter egg hunt at the governor's mansion. This incident serves as a focal point for Kyle's argument that Hillary harbors a disdainful view of those around her.

The narrative further suggests that Hillary looks down on Arkansas residents, referring to them as ""ignorant hillbillies."" Raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois, Hillary is depicted as having developed a sense of superiority that she maintained throughout her life, with the exception of her campaigning efforts in New York, where she appeared more relatable to voters.

Kyle's revelations also touch on the Clintons' dissatisfaction with their lives in Arkansas, which ultimately influenced Bill's decision to forgo running for reelection in 1990. With aspirations for the presidency, Bill Clinton opted to leave behind the state that had been his political home, signaling a shift in their ambitions.

""Hillary: The Other Woman"" promises to stir controversy and reignite discussions about the Clintons' legacy, as Kyle's insights provide a unique perspective on the couple's personal and political lives. As the book gains attention, it remains to be seen how these revelations will impact public perception of Hillary Clinton and her storied career.",-10.0,-3.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,339.0,-0.2727272727272727,-0.008849557522123894

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking ruling, a Massachusetts judge has established a special law that allows black males to flee from police officers without the fear of legal repercussions. This law is now in effect and cannot be appealed, prompting significant debate about its implications for public safety in the state.

The judge's decision stems from the acknowledgment of a pervasive fear among some black Americans regarding interactions with law enforcement. This fear, the ruling suggests, often leads to a tendency to flee when approached by police. While the intention behind the law may be to address these concerns, it raises critical questions about the broader implications for public safety and the effectiveness of law enforcement.

Critics of the ruling argue that police officers face unique dangers that civilians may not fully comprehend. The nature of police work often involves high-stress situations where split-second decisions can mean the difference between life and death. By allowing individuals to flee without consequence, the ruling could potentially hinder police officers' ability to respond effectively to situations that may escalate quickly.

Under the new law, individuals who feel they are being ""disproportionately"" targeted by law enforcement are permitted to run from police without this action being used against them in court. This marks a significant shift from previous legal standards, where fleeing from a police officer could establish ""reasonable suspicion"" for detainment and further investigation. The change raises concerns about the message it sends regarding accountability and the responsibilities of individuals during police encounters.

The ruling has sparked skepticism among various stakeholders, with many questioning the motivations of those who might choose to flee. The author of the article expresses doubt about the long-term implications of this law, suggesting that it could undermine the ability of police to protect and serve effectively. The potential for increased tensions between law enforcement and the communities they serve is a pressing concern, as the law may inadvertently encourage individuals to evade police rather than engage in dialogue or seek resolution.

As Massachusetts grapples with the fallout from this ruling, the conversation surrounding police interactions and community safety continues to evolve. Advocates for reform argue that addressing systemic issues within law enforcement is crucial, while opponents of the ruling fear it may exacerbate existing challenges in maintaining public order.

In conclusion, the Massachusetts judge's ruling on the special law for black males has ignited a complex debate about race, policing, and public safety. As the law takes effect, its impact on both law enforcement practices and community relations remains to be seen, with many calling for a careful examination of the balance between individual rights and the need for effective policing.",-13.0,1.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,502.0,0.05555555555555555,0.00199203187250996
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

In his remarks, Sansaricq criticized the response to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, asserting that corruption overshadowed the essential aid that was needed during that crisis.

Sansaricq highlighted that despite billions of dollars flowing into the Clinton Foundation, the Haitian populace continues to endure significant hardships. He accused the Clintons of exploiting the disaster for their personal gain, alleging that they have stolen billions from the Haitian people. He pointed out the stark contrast between the Clintons' growing wealth and the plight of many Haitians, who still live in tents, questioning the whereabouts of the aid money that was promised.

His comments resonate with themes from Peter Schweizer’s book ""Clinton Cash,"" which scrutinizes the financial dealings of the Clintons. At a recent Trump rally, Sansaricq claimed that former President Bill Clinton attempted to bribe him, an incident he alleges led to the revocation of his visa after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed that she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance to turn back time. This revelation comes in the wake of the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) disappointing performance in recent elections in Berlin, which has been interpreted as a reflection of the growing anti-migrant sentiment across Germany.

Merkel's comments signal a potential shift in her approach to refugee policy, as she acknowledged her unpreparedness for the challenges posed by the 2015 refugee crisis. Taking responsibility for the CDU's poor election results, she recognized that the political landscape has changed significantly since the height of the crisis, with increasing support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Despite her regrets regarding the past, Merkel has firmly dismissed the notion of implementing substantial changes to her existing policy framework. In a clear stance against the Christian Social Union's (CSU) proposal for a cap on migrants, she emphasized that prioritizing Christian migrants over Muslims would contradict the fundamental principles of her party and the core values of Germany. This rejection comes in light of the CSU leader Horst Seehofer's threats to withdraw support for Merkel during her 2017 campaign, which were primarily centered around the contentious issue of migrant caps.

The political climate in Germany has been increasingly charged, with rising anti-migrant sentiments often linked to concerns over terrorism and crime associated with incoming refugees. Merkel's administration has faced mounting pressure as public opinion shifts, and the CDU's recent electoral defeat underscores the challenges she may encounter in the upcoming federal elections.

As Merkel navigates this complex landscape, her willingness to reconsider her approach to refugee policy indicates an awareness of the changing tides in German politics. However, her commitment to maintaining the integrity of her party's principles suggests a delicate balancing act as she seeks to address the concerns of her constituents while remaining true to her values.

The implications of Merkel's reflections on her migrant policy are significant, as they highlight the ongoing debate surrounding immigration in Germany. With the rise of the AfD and the increasing polarization of public opinion, the future of Merkel's policies may be at stake as she prepares for the challenges that lie ahead in the political arena.

In summary, Merkel's acknowledgment of her past decisions and the current political climate reveals a leader grappling with the consequences of her policies. As Germany continues to confront the complexities of migration and integration, the chancellor's next steps will be closely scrutinized by both supporters and critics alike. The outcome of her decisions could have lasting effects on the political landscape and the future of Germany's approach to refugees.",-14.0,-13.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,511.0,-0.8125,-0.025440313111545987
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In a disturbing incident that has drawn attention to issues of domestic violence and the treatment of women, Abdullah, a Somali asylum seeker residing in Sundsvall, Sweden, was arrested following a brutal assault on his pregnant wife. Known to local authorities for a history of violent crimes, Abdullah has been living off welfare benefits since his arrival in Sweden five years ago.

The incident unfolded after Abdullah returned home from a night out with friends. Prior to his return, he had demanded that his wife’s niece, whom she was babysitting, leave the premises. However, upon discovering that the niece was still present, Abdullah's reaction escalated into violence. Witnesses report that he physically attacked his wife, kicking her in the head and stomach, leaving her in a state of distress and fear.

The assault did not end there. In a further act of humiliation, Abdullah poured beer over his wife and urinated on her, actions that have sparked outrage and condemnation from various community members and advocates for women's rights. This incident raises serious concerns about the safety and well-being of women in domestic settings, particularly among vulnerable populations.

The case has also ignited discussions surrounding the interpretation of religious texts and their implications for gender relations. Abdullah's actions have been juxtaposed with Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. Critics have pointed out the selective adherence to Islamic teachings displayed by Abdullah, who, while invoking religious justification for his actions, simultaneously engages in behavior that contradicts the very principles he claims to uphold. His consumption of alcohol and abandonment of his wife further highlight the inconsistencies in his conduct.

This incident is not an isolated case but rather part of a broader pattern of domestic violence that affects many women, particularly those in marginalized communities. Advocates are calling for increased support and resources for victims of domestic abuse, emphasizing the need for comprehensive measures to protect women and hold perpetrators accountable.

As the investigation continues, Abdullah remains in custody, and the community is left grappling with the implications of this violent act. Local authorities are urged to take a firm stance against domestic violence and to provide necessary support for victims, ensuring that such incidents do not become a recurring theme in the lives of those seeking refuge and safety.

The case serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by asylum seekers and the complexities of integrating into a new society. It highlights the urgent need for dialogue around cultural practices, gender equality, and the importance of fostering a safe environment for all individuals, regardless of their background.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the hope remains that justice will be served, and that this incident will catalyze a broader conversation about the rights of women and the responsibilities of individuals within their communities.",-28.0,-42.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,533.0,-2.1,-0.07879924953095685
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, Pennsylvania Republicans are advocating for House Bill 29, legislation that would permit voter intimidation on Election Day. First introduced in June, the bill aims to allow non-residents to monitor polling places and challenge voters, raising concerns about potential disruptions to the voting process.

Critics of the bill, including Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice, have voiced strong opposition, warning that the legislation could lead to discriminatory challenges against voters. Gitlin emphasized that such actions could result in longer wait times at polling stations, further complicating an already tense electoral environment. The implications of this bill are particularly alarming for minority groups, who may face increased intimidation and discouragement from participating in the electoral process.

The push for House Bill 29 comes in the wake of former President Donald Trump's calls for his supporters to monitor polling areas in Pennsylvania. Trump has claimed that the upcoming election could be rigged against him, a narrative that has fueled fears of voter intimidation tactics being employed by his supporters. The close nature of the race in Pennsylvania makes the state a critical battleground for Trump, and the potential for voter intimidation could significantly influence the outcome of the election.

An amendment to the bill has been proposed that would allow it to take effect immediately upon passage, rather than waiting the customary 60 days. This expedited timeline raises further concerns among critics, who argue that it could lead to a chaotic and hostile environment at polling places, particularly as Election Day approaches.

The ramifications of House Bill 29 extend beyond Pennsylvania. If successful, the legislation could serve as a blueprint for similar tactics in other states, potentially undermining the integrity of elections nationwide. The prospect of non-residents challenging voters at polling places could set a dangerous precedent, leading to widespread voter intimidation and disenfranchisement.

As the debate over House Bill 29 continues, advocates for voting rights are mobilizing to combat the potential fallout from the legislation. Organizations dedicated to protecting the electoral process are urging lawmakers to reconsider the implications of allowing voter intimidation tactics to take root in Pennsylvania. The stakes are high, and the outcome of this legislative battle could have lasting effects on the democratic process in the state and beyond.

With the election drawing near, the focus on Pennsylvania intensifies. The state's pivotal role in the electoral landscape makes it a focal point for both parties, and the introduction of House Bill 29 has only heightened tensions. As voters prepare to head to the polls, the potential for intimidation looms large, raising questions about the fairness and accessibility of the electoral process.

In conclusion, House Bill 29 represents a significant shift in the approach to voter monitoring and challenges in Pennsylvania. The potential for voter intimidation, particularly against minority groups, has raised alarms among critics who fear that the bill could disrupt the voting process and disenfranchise eligible voters. As the situation unfolds, the eyes of the nation remain on Pennsylvania, where the implications of this legislation could reverberate far beyond its borders.",-19.0,-32.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,578.0,-1.4545454545454546,-0.05536332179930796

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an American Olympian fencer, made history as the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab. Her groundbreaking achievement has not only inspired many but also brought to light the challenges faced by Muslim women in the United States. Despite her success, Muhammad has expressed feelings of insecurity, recounting a troubling incident where someone followed her home with the intent to report her to the police. This experience underscores the ongoing struggles against prejudice and discrimination that many individuals face.

In her reflections, Muhammad highlighted the severity of racist incidents in the U.S., drawing attention to the tragic shooting in North Carolina and the negative rhetoric surrounding the Khan family during the Democratic National Convention. These events serve as stark reminders of the challenges that marginalized communities continue to confront.

While some may argue that America is an ""Islamophobic"" country, the article presents a counterpoint, noting that hate crimes against Jews occur at a higher rate than those against Muslims. This statistic raises questions about the broader context of discrimination and the complexities of identity in America.

The article further probes Muhammad's decision to remain in the U.S., questioning why she continues to live in a country she perceives as so hostile. It suggests that conditions in many Muslim-majority countries may be even more dire, prompting a reflection on the freedoms and safety that America offers. The potential dangers faced in some Muslim countries, including stoning, genital mutilation, and harsh punishments for crimes, starkly contrast with the liberties that Muhammad enjoys in the United States.

As Ibtihaj Muhammad continues to break barriers in sports and advocate for change, her story serves as a powerful reminder of the ongoing fight against racism and the importance of understanding the complexities of identity and belonging in a diverse society. Her journey not only highlights the challenges faced by Muslim women but also calls for a deeper examination of the narratives surrounding race, religion, and safety in America.",-23.0,-16.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,375.0,-1.2307692307692308,-0.042666666666666665
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In recent days, the city of Charlotte has witnessed a troubling escalation of protests that have devolved into riots, following a police shooting involving a black officer and a black suspect. What began as a demonstration has transformed into a scene of chaos, raising serious questions about the motivations and actions of those involved.

The protests, which were initially framed as a response to police violence, have taken a dark turn, with many participants engaging in behavior that can only be described as thuggish. Rather than fostering a dialogue or seeking justice through peaceful means, these individuals have chosen to wreak havoc on their community, leaving destruction in their wake. The actions of these protesters are not only unjustifiable but also serve to undermine the very cause they claim to support.

One particularly disturbing incident highlights the troubling mindset of some protesters. Instead of offering assistance to an injured police officer, rioters were seen mocking him, demonstrating a complete lack of empathy and respect for human life. This behavior is not only irresponsible but also indicative of a broader trend within the movement that prioritizes chaos over compassion. Such actions raise the question: how can one claim to value life while simultaneously celebrating violence against those who serve and protect?

The author of this article expresses deep disdain for the actions of the protesters, labeling them as irresponsible and violent. It is essential to recognize that if supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement truly valued black lives, they would not engage in acts of violence against one another or against law enforcement. The contradiction between the movement's stated goals and the actions of its supporters is glaring and cannot be ignored.

Furthermore, there is a troubling tendency to generalize negative traits to those who align themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement. Many of these individuals are portrayed as uneducated and violent, perpetuating a stereotype that does a disservice to the broader conversation about race and justice. It is crucial to hold individuals accountable for their actions, rather than allowing their affiliation with a movement to excuse behavior that is harmful to the community.

The condemnation of the Black Lives Matter movement is strong and unwavering. The author emphasizes the importance of judging individuals based on their actions rather than the color of their skin. This perspective is vital in fostering a society that values accountability and responsibility. The actions of a few should not define an entire movement, but when those actions are as egregious as mocking an injured officer, it becomes increasingly difficult to separate the two.

In conclusion, the recent riots in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the challenges facing communities grappling with issues of race and justice. While the desire for change is understandable, the means by which that change is sought must be carefully considered. The actions of the protesters, characterized by violence and chaos, do not contribute to a constructive dialogue about race relations. Instead, they perpetuate a cycle of animosity and division.

The Black Lives Matter movement, while rooted in a desire for justice, must confront the reality of its supporters' actions. If the movement is to be taken seriously, it must distance itself from those who engage in violence and chaos. Only then can a genuine conversation about race and justice take place, one that truly values the lives of all individuals, regardless of their background. Until that happens, the movement will continue to face strong criticism and skepticism from those who demand accountability and responsibility in the pursuit of justice.",-83.0,-56.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,665.0,-2.074074074074074,-0.08421052631578947
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In a poignant farewell to the international stage, President Obama delivered his final speech at the United Nations General Assembly, a moment that has ignited fierce debate among critics and supporters alike. Characterized by many as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal, Obama has faced significant backlash for his policies, including the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and an increasing acceptance of refugees.

During his address, Obama advocated for a one world order and emphasized the importance of international governance. This call for global cooperation has raised eyebrows, particularly among those who believe it undermines American sovereignty. The President suggested that the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms in the name of global security, a notion that has not sat well with many Americans.

While Obama asserted that the right to self-defense should remain sacrosanct, his comments regarding the potential trade-offs of freedom have drawn sharp criticism. Many view this stance as emblematic of a broader arrogance and an unwillingness to compromise, traits that have contributed to the growing divisiveness in Washington D.C.

The speech has prompted questions about the expectations for cooperation among representatives in a political landscape increasingly marked by polarization. Critics argue that Obama's approach reflects a disconnect from the concerns of everyday Americans, who are wary of sacrificing their freedoms for the sake of international agreements.

Despite acknowledging the criticism he has faced, Obama remained steadfast in his beliefs, a position that has only fueled frustration among those who oppose his vision for the future. As he steps down from the presidency, the implications of his final address at the UN will likely resonate in the ongoing debates surrounding governance, security, and individual liberties in the United States and beyond. The legacy of his administration, marked by both significant achievements and contentious policies, will continue to shape the political discourse for years to come.",13.0,9.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,358.0,0.75,0.025139664804469275
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of professional football, two names stand out, albeit for different reasons: Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. Both former starting quarterbacks have found themselves on the sidelines in the NFL, but their paths and public perceptions could not be more divergent.

Tim Tebow, known for his positive demeanor and respectability, has garnered admiration from fans and peers alike. In contrast, Kaepernick has faced significant backlash, with some critics labeling him an ""idiot"" for his controversial actions. The divide between these two figures extends beyond their football careers and into the realm of social activism and personal responsibility.

Tebow has been relatively reserved in his comments regarding Kaepernick's National Anthem protest, which sparked a nationwide conversation about race and inequality. However, he has made it clear that he believes in standing for one’s beliefs in a manner that respects the values of the nation. Tebow's perspective suggests that Kaepernick, as a high-paid bench player, is being disrespectful not only to fans but also to Americans who hold the flag and the anthem in high regard.

In a recent discussion, Tebow articulated that Kaepernick should consider expressing his views during his own time rather than using the platform of a national sporting event. He proposed alternative methods for protest that would not alienate fans or undermine the significance of the anthem. This approach underscores Tebow's belief in the importance of personal responsibility and the need to engage in respectful dialogue.

The article further argues that claims of oppression in the United States are unfounded, suggesting that such assertions are often excuses for a lack of ambition or effort. Citing the presidency of Barack Obama as a counterpoint, the author challenges the narrative of systemic oppression, asserting that success is attainable through hard work and dedication. This perspective aligns with Tebow's own life philosophy, which emphasizes perseverance and a strong work ethic.

Tebow has consistently avoided negative press, focusing instead on his aspirations, including a hopeful return to professional sports with the New York Mets. His commitment to maintaining a positive image stands in stark contrast to the controversies surrounding Kaepernick, who has become a polarizing figure in the sports world.

As the debate continues over the appropriate ways to protest and express dissent, Tebow's views serve as a reminder of the importance of respect and responsibility. The article concludes with a dismissive remark towards Kaepernick, encapsulating the sentiment that while both athletes may share a common past, their futures—and the legacies they leave behind—could not be more different.",-6.0,3.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,484.0,0.16666666666666666,0.006198347107438017
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

The ongoing debate surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border wall has intensified, with proponents emphasizing its role as a crucial national security measure beyond merely curbing illegal immigration. Historical parallels are drawn to China's Great Wall, originally constructed to fend off foreign invaders rather than to restrict the movement of people. This perspective underscores the wall's significance in safeguarding the nation from various threats.

The current landscape in Mexico, largely dominated by drug cartels, has exacerbated security concerns, contributing to a staggering death toll and an environment rife with violence. The implications of an unsecured Southern Border extend beyond illegal immigration; they pose a potential risk for terrorist organizations, including ISIS, to infiltrate the United States. Recent events have highlighted these dangers, particularly a troubling incident involving eight Syrian nationals who attempted to cross into the U.S. from Mexico.

These individuals were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, raising alarms among border security officials. Hector Garza, President of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, has voiced significant concerns regarding the increasing number of Syrian crossings. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities present at the border and the potential for individuals with malicious intent to exploit these weaknesses.

Border Patrol agents are grappling with limited resources, which complicates their ability to effectively manage and deport illegal entrants. The challenges they face are multifaceted, encompassing not only the sheer volume of crossings but also the complexities of identifying and addressing potential threats. As the situation evolves, there is a growing call for stronger border security measures and enhanced support for the efforts of border patrol agents.

In the political arena, one presidential candidate has emerged as a vocal advocate for addressing these pressing border security issues. This candidate's commitment to fortifying the border and ensuring the safety of American citizens resonates with many who are concerned about the implications of an unsecured border.

As discussions continue, the border wall remains a focal point in the broader conversation about national security. The historical context, coupled with recent incidents, underscores the necessity of a robust border security strategy that prioritizes the safety of the nation while addressing the complexities of immigration and security in a rapidly changing world.",-13.0,-20.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,423.0,-1.25,-0.04728132387706856

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

In a recent rally, a group of Haitians in the audience shared their positive experiences and unwavering support for former President Donald Trump. As they recounted their stories, the atmosphere was charged with enthusiasm, with attendees cheering for Trump and voicing their grievances regarding the Clintons' handling of Haiti.

Audience members expressed frustration over the Clintons' actions following the 2010 earthquake, alleging that they disappeared after receiving substantial funds intended for the Haitian people. Many claimed that the money, which was meant to aid recovery efforts, instead found its way to Washington lobbyists and the White House, leaving the Haitian community feeling abandoned.

Further fueling the discontent, claims emerged that Hillary Clinton opposed raising Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5, a move that many believe would have significantly improved the lives of Haitian workers. This sentiment resonated deeply with the audience, who felt that the Clintons had failed to prioritize the needs of Haiti.

As the rally progressed and the audience's sentiments shifted against Hillary Clinton and in favor of Trump, media representatives reportedly left early, missing a crucial moment of public opinion. This decision has drawn criticism, with observers noting that the media's departure prevented a full understanding of the audience's views and the depth of their support for Trump.

The rally highlighted a significant disconnect between the Haitian community's experiences and the narratives often portrayed in mainstream media, raising questions about representation and accountability in political discourse.",-2.0,-1.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,287.0,-0.1111111111111111,-0.003484320557491289
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate of heightened concern over terrorism, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reignited a contentious debate by proposing a ban on Muslim immigration until a better understanding of terrorism can be achieved. This proposal has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who have labeled it as racist. However, some argue that racism is a term that pertains specifically to race, not religion, suggesting that the discourse surrounding Trump's proposal may be mischaracterized.

The article posits that Islam, as a religion, has elements that can lead to radicalization, citing various extremist actions that have occurred globally. This perspective has found resonance among a significant portion of the Australian populace, as evidenced by a recent poll indicating that 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration. This figure marks a notable increase from just 28% in October of the previous year, highlighting a shift in public sentiment.

The same poll reveals that 48% of voters are in favor of initiating a national debate on the issue, suggesting that many Australians are eager to engage in discussions about immigration and its implications for national security and social cohesion. This desire for dialogue is further underscored by the fact that two-thirds of Australians believe that populist senator Pauline Hanson addresses topics that other politicians tend to avoid. Hanson's outspoken views on immigration and national identity have struck a chord with a segment of the electorate that feels their concerns are not being adequately addressed.

Support for a ban on Muslim immigration is driven by a combination of fears surrounding terrorism and worries about the integration of Muslim migrants into Australian values. The poll indicates that 60% of right-wing Coalition voters support the ban, alongside 40% of Labour voters and 34% of Green voters. This cross-party support suggests that the issue transcends traditional political boundaries, reflecting a broader societal concern regarding the implications of immigration on national security and cultural identity.

The pollster behind the survey expressed surprise at the significant level of support for the ban, indicating that it may reflect deeper societal views that have not been fully acknowledged in mainstream political discourse. This growing sentiment raises questions about how political leaders will respond to the concerns of their constituents, particularly in an era where immigration remains a hot-button issue.

In the context of this debate, the article critiques the approach taken by figures like Hillary Clinton, who have opposed such views without engaging with the underlying concerns of the electorate. It suggests that a more effective strategy would involve acknowledging dissenting opinions and fostering a constructive dialogue around the complexities of immigration and national security. By doing so, political leaders may be able to bridge the divide and address the fears that drive public opinion.

As Australia grapples with these pressing issues, the call for a national debate on Muslim immigration is likely to intensify. With nearly half of the population expressing support for a ban, the conversation surrounding immigration policy is poised to become a defining topic in the lead-up to future elections. The implications of these views will undoubtedly shape the political landscape, as leaders navigate the delicate balance between national security, cultural integration, and the values that define Australian society. 

In conclusion, the growing support for a ban on Muslim immigration reflects a significant shift in public sentiment, driven by concerns over terrorism and integration. As the nation prepares for a potential national debate, the challenge for political leaders will be to engage with these issues thoughtfully and constructively, ensuring that all voices are heard in the ongoing conversation about Australia's future.",2.0,3.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,671.0,0.13636363636363635,0.004470938897168405

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a shocking turn of events, a chaotic incident unfolded in the middle of a street, where a fight was anticipated. What began as a typical altercation quickly escalated into a disturbing scene when an individual unexpectedly set those involved in the fight on fire. Eyewitnesses described the atmosphere as chaotic, with people running in all directions, desperately trying to avoid being struck by oncoming vehicles.

The incident has drawn significant attention, particularly due to claims made by Buzzfeed that the description of the crime and its victims was false. However, these assertions have been debunked by the original source, reaffirming the gravity of the situation. The chaotic nature of the event has left many questioning not only the actions of the perpetrator but also the mindset that led to such a violent outburst.

The individual who threw the Molotov cocktail, igniting the flames, has raised eyebrows regarding the premeditation behind the act. The author of a recent commentary on the incident expressed deep concern over the thought process of the person responsible, suggesting that such an extreme reaction indicates a troubling mindset. This incident has sparked a broader conversation about the societal implications of violence and the responsibility of bystanders.

Reflecting on the past, the author nostalgically compared the current state of public safety to a time when bystanders would actively intervene to ensure the safety of those involved in fights. In stark contrast, today’s culture often sees individuals reaching for their phones to record incidents for viral content rather than stepping in to help those in danger. This shift in behavior has raised alarms about the erosion of community responsibility and the desensitization to violence.

The commentary culminates in a poignant call to action for society to care more about individuals and to refrain from resorting to violent actions. It urges a collective reflection on the values that guide our responses to conflict and the importance of prioritizing human safety over the allure of social media fame.

As the investigation into the incident continues, the community is left grappling with the implications of such violence and the role of bystanders in ensuring safety.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- A border wall is deemed necessary for securing access points into America, beyond just preventing illegal immigration.

Luna County, New Mexico, is currently on high alert following a recent traffic stop that involved an undocumented woman from the Middle East. The incident has raised significant concerns regarding national security, particularly in relation to potential terrorist activities. Law enforcement officials are scrutinizing the situation, especially given the woman’s reported interest in a nearby gas pipeline.

The gas pipeline, located in a remote area, has sparked speculation that the woman may have been scouting for future attacks. This has prompted investigations by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol. Fortunately, these investigations have not uncovered any immediate threats; however, the mere presence of an undocumented Muslim woman near the U.S.-Mexico border has left many feeling uneasy.

The situation is further complicated by a 2015 report from Judicial Watch, which indicated a troubling collaboration between Mexican cartels and terrorist organizations. This partnership reportedly facilitates the smuggling of individuals from terror-afflicted nations into the United States. Additionally, a 2017 report highlighted that Islamic terror groups have been crossing the border to identify potential targets within the U.S. These findings underscore the potential risks associated with unsecured border access points.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call for Congress to allocate funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Advocates argue that the wall is essential not only for preventing illegal immigration but also for safeguarding the nation against potential terrorist infiltration. The argument is that many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not solely from Mexico; rather, they often travel from further south, sometimes with the assistance of the Mexican government.

The recent incident in Luna County serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist along the southern border. Proponents of the border wall contend that it could serve as a critical barrier against individuals who may pose a threat to national security. They argue that a terrorist could easily exploit the current situation to gain entry into the U.S., emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced border security measures.

As discussions surrounding immigration and border security continue, the incident in Luna County has reignited the debate over the necessity of a border wall. With national security at stake, the call for action is louder than ever, as officials and citizens alike seek to ensure the safety and security of the nation against foreign threats.",-44.0,-36.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,445.0,-2.0,-0.08089887640449438

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a world where the pressures of professional sports often overshadow personal values, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out as a beacon of hope and inspiration. Wilson, known for his impressive skills on the field, emphasizes a profound love for God and a commitment to helping others. His mission transcends the game of football; he aims to serve and change lives, aspiring to leave a legacy filled with joy.

On the field, Wilson is laser-focused on winning games and leading his team to victory. However, his priorities shift dramatically when he steps off the turf. Outside of the stadium, he dedicates himself to promoting joy and peace, driven by his faith and the belief that good choices can lead to a fulfilling life. This duality of purpose—competing fiercely while nurturing a spirit of kindness—defines Wilson’s approach to both his career and his personal life.

Despite the NFL's advice to refrain from discussing his faith publicly, Wilson remains steadfast in sharing his message through his actions. He believes that living out his faith is the most powerful testimony he can offer. By prioritizing God first, followed by family and friends, and then football, Wilson asserts that this order leads to positive outcomes in all aspects of life. His commitment to this hierarchy is not just a personal mantra; it is a guiding principle that shapes his interactions and decisions.

Wilson’s perspective extends beyond his own life and career. He critiques individuals in positions of power who seem to forget their roots and use their influence for self-glorification. In a time when corruption and deception appear rampant in leadership, particularly within the current political climate, Wilson’s voice resonates with those who yearn for authenticity and integrity. He calls for leaders to remember their responsibilities to the communities they serve, urging them to act with humility and purpose.

The article raises a critical concern regarding the perceived double standard surrounding freedom of speech, particularly when it comes to expressions of faith. While various messages are freely shared in public discourse, discussions about faith often face scrutiny and pushback. This inconsistency raises questions about the values society holds dear and the importance of allowing individuals to express their beliefs without fear of backlash.

Wilson’s commitment to helping others is a cornerstone of his character, and it prompts a reflection on societal attitudes toward altruism. When did the act of helping others become viewed negatively? This question lingers in the air, challenging readers to reconsider their perceptions of service and support. Wilson stands firm in his belief that standing for truth and righteousness is paramount, and he encourages others to do the same.

In a world that often prioritizes personal gain over collective well-being, Russell Wilson’s message is a refreshing reminder of the power of faith and service. His dedication to God, family, and community serves as an example for many, illustrating that true success is measured not just by accolades and victories, but by the positive impact one has on the lives of others.

As Wilson continues to navigate the challenges of professional football, his unwavering commitment to his values and his desire to uplift those around him remain at the forefront of his journey. In doing so, he not only aims to win games but also to inspire a generation to embrace joy, peace, and the importance of helping one another. Through his actions and words, Wilson is not just a quarterback; he is a leader, a role model, and a champion of faith.",79.0,111.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,670.0,4.111111111111111,0.16567164179104477
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a recent address, Pope Francis delivered a poignant critique of fear-based media, drawing a stark comparison to the insidious nature of terrorism. His remarks, while primarily directed at the Italian press, were intended to resonate on a global scale, highlighting the pervasive impact of sensationalist journalism.

The Pope underscored the dangers of journalism that thrives on gossip and rumors, asserting that such practices can inflict significant harm on both individuals and society as a whole. He articulated a vision of media that should uplift and inform rather than instill fear and division. By invoking the words of former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Pope emphasized the destructive nature of fear-mongering, reminding listeners that fear can paralyze communities and distort public perception.

Despite a notable decrease in crime rates, the Pope's comments come at a time when fear is increasingly prevalent among the American populace. Recent polls indicate that fear among Americans is at its highest level in over a decade, a trend that has been exacerbated by media narratives surrounding terrorism and crime. Events such as mass shootings and widespread protests have further fueled this climate of anxiety, leading to a heightened sense of vulnerability among citizens.

In his address, Pope Francis pointed to Fox News as a significant contributor to the culture of fear in American media. The network has been identified as a primary source of fear-driven narratives that shape public perception and influence political discourse. The Pope's critique serves as a call to action for journalists and media outlets to reconsider their role in society and the ethical implications of their reporting.

The implications of fear-based media extend beyond individual anxiety; they can also affect societal cohesion and democratic processes. By fostering a climate of fear, media outlets risk undermining trust in institutions and eroding the fabric of community life. The Pope's remarks serve as a reminder of the responsibility that journalists hold in shaping public discourse and the potential consequences of prioritizing sensationalism over truth.

As the world grapples with the challenges of misinformation and fear-driven narratives, Pope Francis's call for a more responsible and compassionate approach to journalism resonates deeply. His emphasis on the need for media to serve as a force for good rather than a tool for division is a timely reminder of the power of words and the responsibility that comes with them. In an era where fear can easily take hold, the Pope's message encourages a shift towards a more informed and empathetic public dialogue.",-56.0,-37.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,468.0,-2.176470588235294,-0.07905982905982906
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and

However, other snap polls from various sources, including TIME Magazine, Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville, present a more mixed picture, with some suggesting Trump may have the edge.

Key topics during the debate included the Birther movement, the ongoing email controversy surrounding Clinton, and questions regarding Trump’s tax returns. These issues have been pivotal in shaping the candidates' narratives as they vie for voter support. Despite CNN's assertion of Clinton's win, the validity of their poll has been called into question due to a sample that leans Democratic, raising concerns about its representativeness.

In response to the polling results, Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude to his supporters for their favorable responses, while Clinton has yet to comment on the debate or the polling outcomes. The mixed results from various polls suggest that Clinton's perceived victory may not significantly influence voter turnout as the election date approaches.

Adding to the debate's drama, Trump criticized the media for allegedly providing him with a defective microphone, which he claimed hindered his performance. He also suggested that he should have brought up Bill Clinton's infidelity during the debate, a move that could have shifted the conversation in his favor.

As the election draws near, both candidates are acutely aware of the limited time they have to sway undecided voters. In a further twist, Julian Assange has hinted at an impending release on Wikileaks that could potentially impact Clinton's campaign, adding another layer of uncertainty to the already charged political atmosphere.

With the stakes higher than ever, the fallout from the debate and the upcoming revelations could play a crucial role in shaping the final weeks of the campaign.",18.0,1.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,383.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0026109660574412533

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

Hillary Clinton is under fire for her premature declaration of victory following the recent debate, a move that has sparked significant criticism and social media backlash. Despite polls from focus groups at both Fox News and CNN indicating a favorable outcome for Clinton, her early claim has raised eyebrows among political analysts and voters alike.

In a CNN focus group comprised of Florida voters, Clinton was overwhelmingly favored, with an impressive 18-2 split in her favor. Similarly, a Fox News focus group from Pennsylvania showed a strong preference for Clinton, with a 16-6 result. These findings suggest that many viewers perceived Clinton as the stronger candidate during the debate.

However, not all assessments were in Clinton's favor. Noted political analyst Frank Luntz pointed out that while Trump struggled with his comments regarding taxes, he showed improvement when the discussion shifted to Clinton's email scandal. Conversely, Trump’s performance faltered when he was questioned about his previous assertions regarding President Obama’s birthplace, which did not resonate well with the audience.

An alternative poll, however, painted a starkly different picture, showing Trump winning with a staggering 92% to Clinton's 8%. This discrepancy in polling results has added to the confusion surrounding the debate's outcome.

Following Clinton's victory tweet, social media erupted with criticism, leading to the trending hashtag #TrumpWon. Many users expressed their discontent with Clinton's assertion, suggesting that her declaration was premature and not reflective of the debate's actual dynamics.

Critics have also highlighted Clinton's tendency to avoid media engagements after debates, which they argue could hinder her ability to connect with voters and clarify her positions. As the political landscape continues to evolve, Clinton's approach to post-debate communication may come under further scrutiny.

As the fallout from the debate continues, both candidates will need to navigate the complex reactions from voters and the media in the lead-up to the upcoming election.",18.0,18.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,371.0,1.2,0.04851752021563342
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted for the second consecutive night in Charlotte, ignited by the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. The demonstrations, which began as a peaceful expression of outrage, quickly escalated into chaos when a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured during the unrest.

The circumstances surrounding the shooting have become a point of contention, with police claiming that the shooter was a civilian. However, eyewitness accounts suggest otherwise, indicating that the shot may have come from law enforcement. Todd Zimmer, an eyewitness to the events, took to Twitter to voice his concerns, stating, “The city is lying about the incident.” His comments reflect a growing distrust among the public regarding the official narrative provided by the police.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, corroborated Zimmer's claims. Meyer reported that the scene was peaceful prior to the arrival of police in riot gear. “The protest was initially peaceful, with demonstrators chanting ‘Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,’” Meyer recounted. This sentiment was echoed by many who attended the protests, emphasizing that the atmosphere was one of solidarity and non-violence before law enforcement intervened.

Tensions escalated dramatically when police formed a barrier to contain the protesters. Eyewitnesses described a sudden shift in the mood as the police presence intensified. It was at this moment that the shooting occurred, leading to the injury of a protester. Many present at the scene noted that the sound of the gunfire was much louder than that of a typical firearm, further suggesting police involvement in the incident.

As the situation deteriorated, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police took decisive action by reading the riot act to the assembled crowd. In a move that many viewed as an escalation, law enforcement deployed tear gas as protesters began to retreat. This tactic only served to heighten tensions and further inflame the situation, leading to a chaotic scene that left many questioning the police's approach to crowd control.

In the aftermath of the shooting, the City of Charlotte quickly issued a statement asserting that the incident was a civilian-on-civilian shooting. This assertion, however, has been met with skepticism from those who witnessed the events unfold. Additional eyewitness accounts from clergy and other individuals have contradicted the police's narrative, suggesting that law enforcement was responsible for the shooting.

The protests in Charlotte are not an isolated incident but rather part of a broader pattern of state violence in response to demonstrations by African-Americans expressing their frustrations. The killing of Kenneth L. Scott has reignited longstanding grievances regarding police conduct and accountability, particularly in communities of color. As the protests continue, the calls for justice and transparency grow louder, with many demanding a thorough investigation into the events that transpired.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by communities advocating for their rights and the often volatile response from law enforcement. As the protests unfold, the eyes of the nation remain fixed on Charlotte, where the struggle for justice and accountability continues.",-74.0,-47.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,582.0,-1.9583333333333333,-0.08075601374570447
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, finds himself under increasing scrutiny for his foreign policy stance, particularly regarding Russia. Critics have raised alarms over what appears to be a troubling alignment with Vladimir Putin and the Russian regime, suggesting that Trump's connections to Russian interests could compromise U.S. foreign policy.

Reports indicate that Trump is surrounded by individuals with close ties to the Kremlin, raising questions about the influence these relationships may have on his political decisions. Furthermore, Trump has reportedly received support from Russian state-controlled media and intelligence services, which adds another layer of complexity to his candidacy.

In a bid to quell concerns about his connections to Russia, Trump has publicly asserted that he has “ZERO investments in Russia.” However, an investigation by ABC News has uncovered evidence that contradicts this claim, revealing that Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in business dealings. This discrepancy between Trump's statements and the findings of the investigation has fueled skepticism among voters and political analysts alike.

Trump's financial entanglements with Russian oligarchs are particularly noteworthy. He has profited from various ventures, including hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling real estate to Russian buyers. These dealings have raised eyebrows, especially considering the oligarchs' wealth, which was amassed during the transition to a free-market economy in Russia. Critics argue that these oligarchs often use their financial influence to support the Putin regime, creating a potential conflict of interest for Trump.

The implications of these relationships are significant. Former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev has described Russian oligarchs as materialistic and culturally ignorant, suggesting that their motivations may not align with American values or interests. This characterization raises concerns about the potential for these oligarchs to exert influence over Trump, particularly if he were to win the presidency.

The situation becomes even more precarious in light of the 2014 sanctions imposed by the U.S. State Department on Russian oligarchs. With Trump as a potential president, there are fears that he might seek to lift these sanctions for personal gain, further intertwining his financial interests with U.S. foreign policy. This possibility has led to questions about whether Trump could effectively separate his personal financial interests from the broader interests of the United States regarding Russia.

The growing chorus of concern has prompted calls for action from various quarters, including a push for Congress to consider impeachment proceedings against Trump. Advocates for this course of action argue that the alleged conflicts of interest pose a significant threat to national security and the integrity of U.S. foreign policy. They contend that a president with such deep financial ties to a foreign adversary cannot be trusted to act in the best interests of the American people.

As the election draws nearer, the implications of Trump's connections to Russia will likely remain a focal point of debate. Voters are left to grapple with the question of whether they can trust a candidate whose financial dealings may compromise his ability to govern impartially. The potential for a president with such ties to influence U.S. relations with Russia raises alarms not only among political opponents but also among concerned citizens who prioritize national security.

In conclusion, the intersection of Trump's foreign policy and his financial interests in Russia presents a complex and troubling scenario. As investigations continue and public scrutiny intensifies, the implications of these ties will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping the political landscape leading up to the election. The call for accountability and transparency in Trump's dealings with Russian interests is likely to resonate with voters who seek a leader committed to upholding the values and security of the United States.",27.0,16.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,700.0,0.64,0.022857142857142857
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing the looming threat of impeachment as the fallout from the ""Bridgegate"" scandal continues to unfold. Top state legislators are reportedly considering filing articles of impeachment against Christie if he is found guilty of orchestrating the controversial closure of the George Washington Bridge, an act allegedly intended to punish a political rival.

The scandal, which has plagued Christie’s administration since its inception, has drawn significant attention, particularly following recent developments in a trial involving three of his senior aides. Federal prosecutors have implicated Christie in the scandal, raising questions about his involvement and knowledge of the events that led to the bridge closure. The incident resulted in severe traffic jams and, tragically, one death due to delayed emergency services, further intensifying public scrutiny of Christie's actions.

In a significant move, a judge has ordered Christie to produce personal emails related to the scandal, which could provide crucial evidence regarding his involvement. The decision to move forward with impeachment proceedings now rests with Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. If Prieto approves, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would initiate the impeachment process, marking a critical step in what could be a historic political event for the state.

For impeachment to proceed, a majority of the 80-member Assembly must vote in favor. Should the Assembly approve the articles of impeachment, a two-thirds majority in the Senate would be required for a conviction, making the stakes incredibly high for Christie as he navigates this turbulent political landscape.

Christie, who also serves as the chairperson of Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump's transition team, has seen his political career take a significant downturn since endorsing Trump in March 2016. Many observers viewed this endorsement as a decline in Christie's political fortunes, especially given the controversies surrounding his administration.

The scandal first erupted in January 2014, when Christie publicly denied any knowledge of the bridge closure during a press conference. However, revelations have since surfaced indicating that he was informed about the situation during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 but failed to take any action. This lack of response has raised further questions about his leadership and accountability.

As the situation develops, the potential for impeachment looms large over Christie, marking a significant downfall for a politician once regarded as a rising star in the Republican Party. The implications of the Bridgegate scandal extend beyond Christie’s personal political future; they also reflect broader concerns about governance and ethical conduct in public office.

The coming weeks will be critical as legislators weigh their options and the public continues to demand accountability. With the eyes of the nation on New Jersey, the outcome of this scandal could have lasting repercussions not only for Christie but also for the Republican Party as it navigates its own challenges in the current political climate.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a heated Republican primary debate in September 2015, Donald Trump made a bold assertion regarding his past interactions with Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida. Trump claimed that he never lobbied Bush for casino gambling, stating emphatically that if he had wanted to pursue such an endeavor, he would have succeeded. This statement, however, has sparked significant controversy and raised serious questions about the veracity of Trump's claims, particularly in light of his previous admissions.

In a deposition taken in 2007, Trump acknowledged that he did indeed push for casino gambling in Florida, a stark contrast to his assertions during the debate. This discrepancy has led to speculation about the possibility of perjury, as Trump’s statements in the debate appear to directly contradict his earlier testimony. The implications of this contradiction are profound, suggesting that either Trump was not truthful during the debate or that he committed perjury in his deposition.

The narrative Trump presented during the debate seems to be an attempt to sidestep the admission of failure in his lobbying efforts. By claiming he never sought to influence Bush, Trump positioned himself as a figure who does not engage in the political maneuvering that often characterizes the lobbying process. However, this portrayal raises further questions about his integrity and the authenticity of his statements.

Jeb Bush, during the same debate, countered Trump’s claims with a firm assertion that Trump had indeed sought to influence him regarding casino gambling. Bush’s rebuttal not only challenged Trump’s narrative but also highlighted the potential consequences of such lobbying efforts on the political landscape of Florida. The exchange between the two candidates underscored the importance of honesty in political discourse, particularly when it comes to matters that can significantly impact public policy and governance.

The situation draws parallels to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced severe consequences for lying under oath. Clinton’s impeachment was rooted in issues of truthfulness and accountability, raising the question of whether similar standards should apply to Trump. The significance of honesty in political leadership cannot be overstated; it is a cornerstone of public trust and democratic integrity. When leaders are not held accountable for their statements, it can lead to a dangerous erosion of that trust, with far-reaching implications for national safety and governance.

The potential dangers of Trump’s alleged dishonesty are not merely academic. If a leader is willing to misrepresent the truth, it raises concerns about their decision-making and the motivations behind their policies. In a time when political polarization is rampant and trust in government institutions is waning, the need for transparency and accountability is more critical than ever. The stakes are high, and the consequences of unchecked dishonesty can be detrimental to the fabric of democracy.

As the debate surrounding Trump’s statements continues, it is essential for the public to engage with the facts. Readers are encouraged to review the transcripts of both the debate and the deposition to draw their own conclusions about Trump’s truthfulness. The discrepancies between his claims and his past admissions warrant scrutiny and demand a thorough examination of the implications for political accountability.

In light of these revelations, there is a growing call for Congress to take action. The potential for impeachment based on Trump’s alleged crimes is a topic that is gaining traction among those who believe that accountability is paramount in leadership. The notion that a sitting president could face impeachment for dishonesty is not just a matter of political theater; it is a reflection of the values that underpin the democratic process.

The call for impeachment is rooted in the belief that no one is above the law, and that leaders must be held accountable for their actions and statements. The integrity of political leadership is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring that the government operates in the best interests of its citizens. As the nation grapples with the implications of Trump’s statements, the question remains: will Congress act to uphold the principles of accountability and truthfulness in leadership?

In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Donald Trump’s claims about lobbying Jeb Bush for casino gambling raises significant questions about truthfulness and accountability in political leadership. The stark contrast between his statements during the 2015 debate and his admissions in the 2007 deposition cannot be overlooked. As the public seeks to understand the implications of these discrepancies, it is crucial to engage with the facts and hold leaders accountable for their words and actions. The call for impeachment is not merely a political maneuver; it is a demand for integrity in governance and a commitment to upholding the values that define democracy. The time for action is now, and the responsibility lies with both Congress and the public to ensure that truth prevails in the political arena.",-29.0,-6.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,907.0,-0.17647058823529413,-0.006615214994487321
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a drinking game during a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN.

In a striking reminder of the potential dangers associated with drinking games, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a warning ahead of a recent 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN. Many viewers engaged in a drinking game, taking a sip every time former President Donald Trump made a false statement. However, Murthy cautioned that such a practice could lead to serious health risks, including alcohol poisoning.

Murthy's concerns are not unfounded. He highlighted the alarming trend of drinking games during political debates, particularly with the current Republican candidates. In 2012, there were approximately 70,000 incidents of alcohol poisoning linked to debate drinking games, underscoring the risks involved. The Surgeon General's warning echoes a similar caution he issued prior to the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on September 26, 2016, where he reiterated the dangers of drinking in response to Trump's frequent falsehoods.

A recent study by Politico revealed the extent of Trump's misleading statements, reporting that he told 87 lies over a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, averaging a lie every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Based on this average, it is estimated that Trump likely made around 28 false statements during the CNN debate, raising concerns about the potential for viewers to overindulge in alcohol consumption.

In light of these statistics, Murthy emphasized the need for viewers to drink responsibly during future debates. He noted that first responders were on high alert, preparing for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate. The Surgeon General's warning serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of moderation, especially in the context of political discourse, where misinformation can be rampant.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, viewers are encouraged to engage in debates thoughtfully and responsibly. The Surgeon General's message is clear: while political debates can be entertaining, they should not come at the cost of personal health and safety. As the next debate approaches, the public is urged to consider the implications of drinking games and to prioritize their well-being over the thrill of the game.",-17.0,-11.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,396.0,-0.7333333333333333,-0.027777777777777776
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the wake of a recent debate, mainstream media outlets have widely declared Hillary Clinton the victor, praising her performance and articulating a clear advantage over her opponent. However, a stark contrast emerged from online polls and social media trends, where the hashtag #TrumpWon surged to prominence, capturing the attention of many users across the United States.

The origins of the hashtag #TrumpWon have raised eyebrows, as it has been traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. This revelation has sparked concerns about the influence of foreign entities on American political discourse. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is known for employing cyber-trolls to further his agenda through disinformation campaigns, and the emergence of this hashtag appears to be a part of that strategy. These trolls are tasked with creating discord and amplifying divisions within American society, a tactic that has been increasingly scrutinized in recent years.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, Russian state-controlled media has been actively promoting Donald Trump to European audiences, suggesting a concerted effort to bolster his image abroad. Analysts believe that Putin's ultimate goal is to manipulate Trump into lifting economic sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs, thereby benefiting his regime and its allies.

Reports from ex-bloggers who have worked in these troll farms describe their working conditions as harsh, with strict oversight and penalties for performance. This insight into the operations of these disinformation campaigns underscores the need for vigilance among social media users, who may unknowingly engage with content designed to mislead and divide.

In light of these developments, experts are warning against placing undue trust in online polls and engaging with potentially Russian trolls. The manipulation of public opinion through social media is a growing concern, and citizens are urged to approach online narratives with skepticism.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, there is a growing call to action for Congress to consider the impeachment of Donald Trump. Advocates argue that the potential for foreign influence in American elections poses a significant threat to democracy, and decisive action is necessary to safeguard the integrity of the political process.

The debate may have concluded, but the implications of the discourse surrounding it are far from settled. As the nation grapples with the intersection of politics and foreign interference, the need for informed and critical engagement with media and online content has never been more crucial.",-9.0,-3.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,442.0,-0.1875,-0.006787330316742082
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor. The lawsuit alleges that the company has engaged in systematic discrimination against Asian job applicants during its hiring process, raising significant concerns about the fairness and integrity of its employment practices.

As a contractor for the federal government, including agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA), Palantir is expected to adhere to strict non-discriminatory hiring standards. However, the Department of Labor's lawsuit highlights troubling statistics regarding the company's hiring practices for engineering intern positions. According to the allegations, out of 130 applicants for these roles, a staggering 73% were Asian. Despite this high percentage of Asian applicants, only four were hired, compared to 17 non-Asian candidates. This disparity raises serious questions about the company's commitment to equitable hiring practices.

The statistical analysis presented in the lawsuit suggests that the likelihood of such an outcome occurring by chance is estimated to be one in a billion. This striking figure underscores the severity of the allegations and the potential implications for Palantir's hiring policies. The Department of Labor has emphasized that federal contractors, like Palantir, must ensure that their hiring practices are free from discrimination, particularly in light of the diverse applicant pool that many companies encounter.

Peter Thiel, who has been a controversial figure in the tech industry and beyond, is at the helm of Palantir. A first-generation immigrant, Thiel is known for his support of former President Donald Trump, who has taken a hardline stance against immigration. Thiel's political affiliations and public persona have often sparked debate, particularly given his history as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook. His influence in the tech world is significant, and his actions often draw attention.

Thiel gained notoriety for his role in funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, a legal battle that ultimately led to the bankruptcy of the media company. This high-profile case showcased Thiel's willingness to engage in contentious legal disputes, further solidifying his reputation as a powerful figure in both business and media.

In addition to his business ventures, Thiel made headlines as the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention. During his speech, he expressed pride in his identity while simultaneously criticizing what he described as government incompetence. Despite the positive reception of his address, the Republican Party adopted an anti-LGBT platform during the same convention, highlighting the complexities and contradictions within the party's stance on social issues.

As the lawsuit unfolds, Palantir's spokeswoman has stated that the company intends to defend itself vigorously against the allegations of bias. The outcome of this legal battle could have significant ramifications not only for Palantir but also for the broader tech industry, particularly in how companies approach diversity and inclusion in their hiring practices.

The Department of Labor's actions serve as a reminder of the importance of non-discriminatory hiring practices, especially for companies that engage with the federal government. As the lawsuit progresses, it will be crucial to monitor how Palantir responds to these serious allegations and whether any changes will be made to its hiring policies in light of the scrutiny it now faces.

In a landscape where diversity and inclusion are increasingly prioritized, the implications of this lawsuit extend beyond Palantir itself. It raises critical questions about the hiring practices of tech companies and the need for accountability in ensuring that all applicants are given fair consideration, regardless of their background. As the case develops, stakeholders across the industry will be watching closely to see how it impacts not only Palantir's future but also the broader conversation around discrimination in the workplace.",-18.0,-9.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,701.0,-0.34615384615384615,-0.012838801711840228

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

Authorities are actively pursuing leads in connection with the Chelsea bombing that took place last Saturday, injuring 29 individuals. The incident has raised significant concerns about public safety and the potential for further attacks, prompting a thorough investigation by law enforcement.

In a critical development, a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster located just four blocks away from the site of the initial explosion. This discovery has heightened fears and underscored the urgency of the investigation as police work to determine whether the two incidents are connected.

Three significant leads have emerged in the ongoing investigation, each providing potential insights into the motives and identity of the perpetrator. 

The first lead involves a hand-written letter that was found alongside the second bomb. The letter is partially written in Arabic, raising questions about its significance and whether it may provide clues about the bomber's identity or motivations. Authorities are currently analyzing the letter for any additional information that could assist in the investigation.

The second lead comes from an unidentified male caller who contacted 911 to issue a chilling warning about potential further explosions. The caller ominously stated, “There will be more,” which has prompted law enforcement to take the threat seriously and to increase security measures in the area.

The third lead is a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ which claims to serve as the bomber's manifesto. The page expresses grievances against various societal issues, including the oppression of the LGBTQ+ community and other forms of inequality. The individual behind the post claims responsibility for the explosions and expresses a disturbing intent to continue their actions, stating, “This is not the end, this is just the beginning.” 

While the claims made on the Tumblr page have drawn attention, there is a growing skepticism regarding their authenticity. Law enforcement officials have expressed concerns that individuals may be attempting to exploit the situation for notoriety or attention, complicating the investigation further. The potential for misinformation in the wake of such a serious incident has prompted investigators to approach these claims with caution.

As the investigation unfolds, police are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. The community is on high alert, and the authorities are working diligently to ensure the safety of residents and visitors alike. 

The Chelsea bombing has not only left many injured but has also sparked a broader conversation about societal issues that the alleged bomber has highlighted. The motivations cited in the Tumblr post reflect deep-seated frustrations that resonate with various communities, raising questions about how society addresses these grievances.

In the wake of the bombing, local leaders and community organizations are coming together to promote unity and resilience. They are emphasizing the importance of standing against violence and discrimination in all forms, while also advocating for open dialogue about the issues raised by the alleged bomber.

As the investigation continues, police are committed to uncovering the truth behind the Chelsea bombing and ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice. The community remains hopeful that the leads being pursued will lead to a swift resolution, allowing residents to feel safe once again in their neighborhoods. 

With the investigation still in its early stages, authorities are asking anyone with information related to the bombing or the leads that have emerged to come forward. The safety of the community depends on collective vigilance and cooperation in the face of such a troubling incident.",-25.0,-6.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,638.0,-0.24,-0.009404388714733543
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As Donald Trump intensifies his campaign efforts at the age of 70, questions surrounding his mental fitness for an upcoming debate with Hillary Clinton have come to the forefront. With a rigorous schedule that keeps him on the move, Trump is preparing for what many consider a pivotal moment in his campaign. However, recent social media activity has raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about his readiness.

Less than 24 hours before the highly anticipated debate, Trump took to Twitter to share a post that many found perplexing. The tweet, which covered three unrelated topics— a shooting in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina— appeared disjointed and incoherent. Critics have pointed to this as a sign of a wandering mind and a lack of focus, raising concerns about his ability to effectively engage in a debate setting.

The timing of the tweet has led some to question whether Trump is mentally prepared to face Clinton, especially given the high stakes of the debate. The disjointed nature of his messaging has prompted speculation that he may be struggling to maintain the clarity and coherence necessary for such a critical event. As the campaign heats up, the implications of his recent behavior could signal a decline in his overall campaign strategy.

Political analysts are closely monitoring Trump's performance leading up to the debate, as they believe that his mental acuity will play a significant role in determining the outcome. The ability to articulate thoughts clearly and respond effectively to opponents is crucial in a debate, and Trump's recent tweet has left many wondering if he possesses the focus required to succeed.

As the debate approaches, the spotlight is firmly on Trump, with supporters and detractors alike eager to see how he will perform. The juxtaposition of his rigorous campaign schedule against the backdrop of his recent social media activity raises important questions about his mental fitness and overall readiness.

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio – Hillary Clinton's door-knocking event, scheduled for 1 PM, was anticipated to be a rallying point for volunteers eager to support her campaign. However, the turnout was far from what her team had hoped for, as only one individual, a supporter of Donald Trump, showed up to document the occasion.

The event, which was designed to engage local voters and galvanize support for Clinton's candidacy, ended up being a stark illustration of the challenges her campaign faces. Clinton's staff, upon recognizing the Trump supporter, ultimately asked him to leave, highlighting the tension that has characterized the current political climate.

What was expected to be a bustling campaign office filled with enthusiastic volunteers turned out to be a quiet gathering of only Clinton's staff members. The empty office space served as a visual representation of the potential issues plaguing Clinton's ground game, raising alarms about her ability to mobilize supporters effectively.

The lack of attendance at the event has sparked concerns that Clinton's support may be waning not just in Ohio, but potentially in other key states as well. Observers have noted that the enthusiasm surrounding her campaign appears to be significantly lower compared to the packed rallies held by her opponent, Donald Trump. This disparity in turnout could have serious implications as the election approaches.

As Clinton's campaign continues to invest heavily in various outreach efforts, questions are being raised about the effectiveness of this spending. The stark contrast between the empty campaign office in Delaware and the vibrant, crowded events hosted by Trump has led to speculation about the viability of Clinton's strategy moving forward. 

Political analysts are beginning to wonder whether Clinton's campaign is in trouble, especially as Trump’s rallies draw large crowds and enthusiastic supporters. The palpable energy at these events stands in stark contrast to the quiet atmosphere of Clinton's door-knocking initiative, suggesting a potential shift in voter sentiment.

The implications of this lack of support could extend beyond just one event. With the election looming, the enthusiasm gap between the two candidates may play a crucial role in determining the outcome. Trump's ability to attract large crowds and energize his base could translate into a significant advantage as voters head to the polls.

Furthermore, the current political landscape raises questions about Clinton's overall strategy. If her campaign cannot effectively engage supporters in key battleground states, it may struggle to secure the necessary votes to win the election. The empty campaign office in Delaware serves as a cautionary tale, indicating that Clinton's team may need to reassess their approach to voter outreach and engagement.

As the election season heats up, the dynamics between Clinton and Trump will continue to evolve. The enthusiasm and public perception surrounding each candidate will be critical factors in shaping the electoral landscape. With Trump’s rallies consistently drawing large crowds, Clinton's campaign may need to find new ways to invigorate her base and ensure that her supporters are mobilized effectively.

In conclusion, the door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, has raised significant concerns about the state of Clinton's campaign. The lack of turnout, coupled with the presence of a Trump supporter, underscores the challenges she faces as the election approaches. With enthusiasm for her campaign seemingly dwindling, Clinton's team must act swiftly to address these issues if they hope to compete effectively against Trump in the upcoming election.",-7.0,46.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,653.0,1.84,0.07044410413476264

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a recent bombing in New York City, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his immediate reaction, labeling the incident accurately as a ""bombing."" This straightforward characterization, however, has sparked controversy, particularly with CNN, which has faced backlash for its coverage of the event.

CNN's criticism of Trump centered around his use of the term ""bombing,"" despite the fact that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also referred to the attack in the same manner. In a move that has drawn ire from Trump and his supporters, CNN edited out Clinton's reference to the bombing in their reporting, a decision that has raised questions about media bias and the integrity of news coverage.

Trump did not hold back in his response, appearing on the popular morning show Fox and Friends, where he labeled CNN as ""disgusting and disgraceful."" He accused the network of dishonesty, emphasizing that his description of the event was not only accurate but also necessary in the context of the ongoing discussions about terrorism and national security. Trump expressed his frustration that CNN chose to omit Clinton's terminology, suggesting that such editorial decisions undermine the credibility of the media.

In his remarks, Trump also took the opportunity to condemn what he described as ""stupid"" leaders who have adopted lenient stances on terrorism. He argued that the current approach to handling such threats is insufficient and called for tougher measures to combat the growing menace of terrorism. His comments reflect a broader concern about national security and the effectiveness of current leadership in addressing these critical issues.

Moreover, Trump voiced his apprehensions regarding the influx of refugees into the United States, particularly in light of the ongoing crisis in Syria. He criticized former President Barack Obama’s plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees, claiming that Clinton intends to significantly increase that number if elected. Trump has consistently argued that the vetting process for incoming refugees is inadequate, raising alarms about potential security risks associated with the current system.

The former president's remarks resonate with a segment of the population that shares his concerns about immigration and national security. By linking the bombing to broader issues of terrorism and refugee policies, Trump aims to galvanize support among voters who prioritize these topics in the upcoming election cycle.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Trump's comments serve as a reminder of the contentious nature of discourse surrounding terrorism and immigration in America. The incident in New York City has not only reignited discussions about security measures but has also highlighted the role of media in shaping public perception of such events.

In conclusion, the bombing in New York City has prompted a flurry of reactions, particularly from Trump, who has seized the moment to criticize both the media and current leadership on issues of national security and immigration. His remarks underscore the ongoing debate about how best to address the challenges posed by terrorism and the complexities of refugee resettlement in the United States. As the nation grapples with these pressing issues, the discourse surrounding them is likely to intensify, particularly as the political landscape heats up in the lead-up to the next election.",-45.0,-17.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,606.0,-0.85,-0.028052805280528052

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

In a surprising turn of events, Ahmad Rahami, a convicted terrorist and murderer, has filed a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey, claiming discrimination against his family based on their cultural background. The lawsuit, which has drawn significant attention, alleges a pattern of harassment directed at his family, who have operated a chicken restaurant in the area since 2002.

Rahami's family, originally from Afghanistan, includes Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad. They assert that local officials have subjected them to unjust treatment, including numerous tickets and court summons that they believe are unwarranted. The family claims that their restaurant has been unfairly targeted, particularly for remaining open past 10 PM, despite having the necessary permissions to do so.

The lawsuit further alleges that the Rahami family has faced racial abuse from local residents, including derogatory comments aimed at their Muslim faith. This aspect of the lawsuit highlights the broader issues of discrimination and prejudice that can affect immigrant communities, particularly in the wake of heightened tensions surrounding terrorism and cultural differences.

Rahami's legal action accuses the Elizabeth police of violating their constitutional rights, claiming that the police have attempted to force the family’s restaurant to close earlier than permitted. The police reportedly justified their actions by citing high crime rates in the area, a rationale that the Rahami family contests as discriminatory and unfounded.

The timing of the lawsuit raises eyebrows, particularly given Ahmad Rahami's criminal history. Five years after the alleged harassment began, he was arrested for planting bombs in New York City, an act that has led to his conviction as a terrorist. This connection has prompted questions about the motivations behind the lawsuit and whether it serves as a genuine grievance or a strategic maneuver in light of his past actions.

The case has sparked discussions about the treatment of immigrant families in the United States, especially those from Muslim backgrounds. Advocates for civil rights have expressed concern over the allegations of racial abuse and discrimination, emphasizing the need for fair treatment and protection under the law for all individuals, regardless of their cultural background.

As the lawsuit unfolds, it remains to be seen how the courts will respond to the claims made by Ahmad Rahami and his family.

Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have surfaced regarding potential pay-to-play corruption involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the foundation's financial practices and its true purpose. The Clinton campaign has responded to these allegations by highlighting the foundation's positive contributions to global health and development. However, critics argue that the foundation primarily functions as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates.

In examining the foundation's financial records, significant concerns arise. According to IRS filings from 2014, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants. This figure is particularly striking when considering the foundation's total spending for that year, which amounted to nearly $91.3 million. Of this total, less than $5.2 million was directed toward charitable causes, raising eyebrows among watchdog groups and critics alike.

The financial breakdown reveals that the foundation spent a staggering $34.8 million on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, alongside $50.4 million categorized as ""other expenses."" This allocation of funds has led to accusations that the foundation is more focused on enriching its staff and maintaining operations than on fulfilling its charitable mission.

Moreover, the foundation's charitable spending saw a significant decline in 2014, dropping by 40% compared to the previous year, despite an increase of $30 million in revenue. This contradiction has fueled skepticism about the foundation's priorities and its commitment to philanthropy. Notably, salaries and other expenses rose by $5 million in the same year, further complicating the narrative of a charity dedicated to altruism.

Critics assert that the foundation's financial practices suggest a troubling pattern, with allegations that Hillary Clinton may have leveraged her position as Secretary of State for personal financial gain. This assertion raises serious ethical questions about the intersection of public service and private wealth generation.

As the scrutiny surrounding the Clinton Foundation intensifies, the implications of these allegations could have far-reaching consequences for Hillary Clinton and her political aspirations. The foundation, once viewed as a beacon of charitable work, now faces a critical examination of its financial integrity and the motivations behind its operations. The ongoing debate highlights the complexities of philanthropy in the political arena and the potential for conflicts of interest that can arise when personal and public interests intertwine.",25.0,9.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,434.0,0.5294117647058824,0.020737327188940093

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York, former President Barack Obama has left many Americans in shock and disbelief. The address, which took place at a high-dollar fundraiser, has drawn sharp criticism for its perceived insensitivity in the wake of recent violent incidents in the region.

Over the weekend, New York and New Jersey experienced a series of bombings, while a separate stabbing incident occurred in Minnesota. These acts of violence, which have been labeled as terrorism, prompted a widespread expectation among the public for a statement of solidarity from elected officials. However, instead of addressing these grave incidents, Obama chose to focus his remarks on issues such as sexism in the media and his support for Hillary Clinton.

Critics have been quick to label the former President as ""useless"" and ""arrogant,"" arguing that his decision to prioritize a fundraiser over a response to the attacks reflects a troubling disconnect from the realities facing the American public. Many feel that in times of crisis, leaders should offer words of comfort and solidarity, yet Obama’s speech seemed to ignore the victims and their families entirely.

While some have defended Obama, suggesting that he may not have had sufficient information to comment on the bombings and stabbing, the author of this article firmly believes that a basic acknowledgment of the incidents was warranted. The expectation for leaders to respond to acts of violence is not merely a formality; it is a crucial aspect of providing reassurance to a frightened public.

The outrage surrounding Obama’s speech highlights a growing frustration among citizens who feel that their leaders are failing to address pressing issues. In a time when the nation is grappling with the implications of terrorism and violence, the public looks to its leaders for guidance and support. Instead, they were met with a speech that many viewed as tone-deaf and out of touch.

As the details of the bombings and stabbing continue to unfold, the need for a unified response from elected officials becomes increasingly clear. The public's expectation for solidarity is not just about words; it is about demonstrating a commitment to the safety and well-being of all citizens. In this context, Obama’s choice to focus on political fundraising rather than the pressing issues at hand has left many feeling disillusioned.

The criticism of Obama’s speech is not merely a reflection of disappointment; it is indicative of a broader concern regarding the priorities of political leaders. In an era where terrorism and violence can strike at any moment, the public demands that their leaders prioritize the safety and security of the nation over political ambitions.

In conclusion, Obama’s recent speech has ignited a firestorm of criticism, with many Americans expressing outrage at his failure to address the tragic events that unfolded over the weekend. As the nation grapples with the implications of these attacks, the expectation for leaders to respond with empathy and solidarity remains paramount. The disconnect between the former President’s focus on fundraising and the urgent need for a response to violence has left many questioning the effectiveness and priorities of their leaders in times of crisis.",-25.0,-55.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,594.0,-2.75,-0.09259259259259259
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

Public awareness of corruption allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation has surged since Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A recent report has unveiled more serious issues within the foundation than previously understood, raising concerns about its operations and impact.

The Daily Caller has reported that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), one of the foundation's most significant and well-known initiatives, distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. This alarming practice, as suggested by a draft congressional report, may have increased risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these medications for their health.

The implications of this distribution of diluted drugs could lead to renewed scrutiny of the Clinton charity, particularly as Hillary Clinton gears up for her presidential campaign. The potential fallout from these revelations may complicate her political aspirations, as critics may leverage this information against her.

Furthermore, the congressional study has uncovered troubling connections between Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-American figures who are currently under investigation by the FDA and SEC. The report highlights the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company notorious for its history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the FDA. This association raises significant questions about the foundation's practices and oversight.

As the investigation continues, it remains unclear how many AIDS patients received the compromised drugs, leaving many to wonder about the extent of the potential harm caused by these actions. The report has gone so far as to call for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further damage.

With these serious allegations coming to light, the Clinton Foundation finds itself at a critical juncture, facing increased public scrutiny and potential legal ramifications. The outcome of this investigation could have lasting implications for the foundation and its founders as they navigate the complex landscape of public service and accountability.",-14.0,-23.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,351.0,-1.7692307692307692,-0.06552706552706553
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?",http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,Mockarena Cotr,http://www.chicksontheright.com,{'$date': 1474332562000},,"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2fb62ae885c1cdb2a0c69249a9c25a?s=120&d=mm&r=g,http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN#!,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cotrolog-smalll.png,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CotR_banner1-copy-2.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8W3QtpyKy7xuZ.gif,http://rightchicks.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/book-thumb.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49-812x478.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kardashian-jenner-424x250.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d1x2X8_nNBHjc.gif",https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/,"{""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Chicks On The Right"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 812, ""identifier"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""height"": 550}, ""url"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""image"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""card"": ""summary"", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right""}, ""robots"": ""noodp"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/"", ""section"": ""Constitution"", ""tag"": ""felony"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-19T20:49:22-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- Arizona state legislature criticized for poorly worded laws affecting parenting activities.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for enacting poorly worded laws that have significant implications for parenting activities. A recent law, intended to protect children from molesters, has raised alarm among legal experts and parents alike due to its vague language and potential for misuse.

At the heart of the controversy is a specific provision that criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals. This sweeping legislation has inadvertently made parents felons for engaging in common, everyday activities such as diaper changes or bathing their children. Critics argue that while the law's intention is to safeguard children, it fails to take into account normal parental behavior, leading to a chilling effect on caregiving practices.

The Arizona Supreme Court has further complicated matters by ruling that defendants accused under this law must prove a lack of sexual intent. This ruling undermines the fundamental presumption of innocence, placing the burden of proof on the accused rather than the prosecution. Legal experts, including John Pfaff, have expressed concern that this shift could lead to significant injustices, particularly in cases involving parents and caregivers.

Pfaff highlights the troubling dynamics of plea bargaining in such cases, where defendants may feel pressured to plead guilty to lesser charges to avoid the severe consequences associated with the original accusations. This practice raises ethical questions about the fairness of the legal process and the potential for innocent individuals to be coerced into accepting guilt for crimes they did not commit.

The implications of Arizona's child molestation laws extend beyond individual cases; they could be misused to target parents and caregivers, leading to potential prosecutorial harassment. The fear of being wrongfully accused may deter parents from engaging in necessary caregiving activities, ultimately harming the parent-child relationship and the well-being of children.

The recent decision by the Arizona Supreme Court has sparked widespread concern about the erosion of constitutional rights and due process for parents in the state. Many are questioning the wisdom of trusting government decisions in this sensitive context, given the potential for overreach and misinterpretation of the law.

As the debate continues, the sentiment among parents and legal advocates reflects a growing skepticism about the ability of lawmakers and prosecutors to apply these laws with the necessary common sense. The overarching fear is that the well-intentioned goal of protecting children could lead to unintended consequences that jeopardize the very relationships that are meant to be safeguarded.

In light of these developments, it is clear that the Arizona state legislature must reevaluate its approach to child protection laws. A more nuanced understanding of parental behavior and a commitment to preserving the rights of parents are essential to ensure that the legal system serves its intended purpose without infringing on the fundamental rights of families. As the conversation unfolds, the need for clarity and fairness in the law has never been more pressing.",-12.0,-30.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,528.0,-1.5789473684210527,-0.056818181818181816
Fake_73-Webpage,Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?,"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

× 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts with the possibility of Hillary Clinton assuming the presidency, speculation is rife regarding the future of Michelle Obama. The former First Lady, who has become a prominent figure in American public life, may find herself in a position of influence once again. However, the prospect of covering the Obamas for another four years raises discomfort for some observers, who question the implications of such a scenario.

Critics have begun to scrutinize Michelle Obama’s legacy, particularly her initiatives during her time in the White House. One of the most notable programs she championed was the school lunch initiative, aimed at improving the nutritional quality of meals served to children. While the program garnered support from health advocates, it also faced backlash from parents and students who felt that the changes were too restrictive and did not take into account the preferences of children. This criticism has led some to question the effectiveness and long-term impact of her efforts.

In addition to her school lunch program, Michelle Obama’s public statements have also come under fire. Detractors argue that her approach to health and wellness, while well-intentioned, often lacked a nuanced understanding of the diverse challenges faced by families across the country. As discussions about her potential role in a Clinton administration heat up, questions about her qualifications for such a position are becoming increasingly relevant. What expertise does she bring to the table, and how would her experiences shape policy decisions?

Hillary Clinton has long been an advocate for government involvement in child-rearing, a belief that aligns with her vision of a more engaged and supportive state. This perspective raises concerns among some who fear that such an approach could lead to an overreach of government authority in the lives of families. The idea of the government acting as a parental figure is contentious, with historical precedents highlighting the dangers of such control. Critics argue that this could undermine parental rights and responsibilities, leading to a one-size-fits-all approach to child upbringing.

Michelle Obama has made it clear that she intends to continue her campaign for healthy living for children indefinitely. Her commitment to this cause reflects a broader trend among progressive leaders who advocate for increased government involvement in public health initiatives. However, this progressive influence on American education and child upbringing has sparked a debate about the role of government in shaping the lives of children. Many argue that while promoting healthy lifestyles is important, it should not come at the expense of personal choice and parental authority.

The author of this piece expresses a strong opposition to the notion of government as a parental figure, emphasizing the importance of individual freedoms and the potential risks associated with such a paradigm. The historical context of government overreach serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the need to balance public health initiatives with respect for family autonomy.

As the political climate evolves, the potential for Michelle Obama to play a significant role in a Clinton administration remains uncertain. While her dedication to children’s health is commendable, the implications of her involvement in government policy warrant careful consideration. The ongoing debate about the role of government in child-rearing and education will undoubtedly shape the discourse surrounding her legacy and future endeavors.

In conclusion, as speculation continues about the future of the Obamas in a potential Clinton administration, it is essential to critically examine the implications of their influence on American society. The conversation surrounding Michelle Obama’s legacy, qualifications, and the role of government in child upbringing is far from over, and it will be a focal point in the coming years as the nation navigates its political future.",6.0,26.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,688.0,1.0,0.0377906976744186

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has emerged involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), with allegations surfacing that the organization distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This troubling revelation has raised serious concerns about the quality of healthcare provided to some of the most vulnerable populations in the world.

The controversy is closely linked to Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has a notorious history in the pharmaceutical industry. In 2013, Ranbaxy was found guilty of fraud and introducing adulterated drugs into commerce, resulting in a staggering $500 million fine. This past misconduct has now resurfaced, casting a shadow over the Clinton Foundation's ongoing relationship with the company.

A draft congressional report, initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, has brought to light the potential dangers associated with the distribution of these substandard drugs. The report suggests that the use of ineffective medications may have increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these treatments. The implications of this finding are dire, as it raises questions about the safety and efficacy of the drugs provided to those battling HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.

Dinesh Thakur, a former employee of Ranbaxy, has emerged as a key whistleblower in this scandal. His revelations led to a significant lawsuit against the company, highlighting the systemic issues within Ranbaxy that allowed for the distribution of adulterated medications. Thakur's courage in coming forward has shed light on the potential consequences of prioritizing profit over patient safety.

As the investigation unfolds, concerns have been raised about the number of lives lost due to the distribution of ineffective drugs. Patients who were promised effective treatment may have instead received medications that did not meet the necessary standards, leading to devastating health outcomes. The false promises made to these individuals have sparked outrage among advocates for public health and patient rights.

Critics have directed their ire at the Clinton Foundation for its continued partnership with Ranbaxy, despite the company's documented history of poor quality control and fraudulent practices. The foundation's decision to align itself with a manufacturer that has faced significant legal repercussions raises ethical questions about its commitment to the well-being of patients in need.

In 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, further complicating the narrative surrounding the distribution of substandard medicines. This funding was intended to support efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, but the potential impact of these substandard drugs on patient health has come under scrutiny. The allocation of such a significant sum to a company with a questionable track record has led to calls for greater accountability and transparency in the distribution of aid.

The implications of this scandal extend beyond the immediate health risks posed to patients. It raises broader questions about the priorities of the Clintons and their charitable initiatives. Critics argue that the foundation appears to prioritize financial gain over the well-being of individuals, particularly in the context of its partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. This perception has the potential to undermine the foundation's credibility and the trust of those it aims to help.

As the congressional report continues to develop, it is clear that the fallout from this scandal will be significant. The potential health risks associated with the distribution of substandard HIV/AIDS drugs cannot be understated, and the implications for the Clinton Foundation's reputation are profound. Advocates for public health are calling for a thorough investigation into the practices of both Ranbaxy and the Clinton Health Access Initiative, demanding accountability for any harm caused to patients.

In the coming weeks, as more information becomes available, the public will be watching closely to see how the Clinton Foundation responds to these allegations. The organization has long been a prominent player in global health initiatives, and this scandal threatens to tarnish its legacy. The foundation's commitment to improving health outcomes for those in need will be scrutinized as the investigation unfolds.

In conclusion, the allegations surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its partnership with Ranbaxy raise serious ethical concerns about the distribution of healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa. The potential risks to patient health, coupled with the foundation's history of collaboration with a company known for its fraudulent practices, have sparked outrage and calls for accountability. As the investigation progresses, the implications for both the Clinton Foundation and the patients it serves will be closely monitored, with the hope that lessons will be learned to prevent such a scandal from occurring in the future.",-63.0,-52.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,834.0,-1.625,-0.06235011990407674

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated the State Department to release documents related to security training for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides within a five-day timeframe. This decision comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit initiated by the Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which has been actively pursuing these records.

Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, rejected the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, a move that underscores the court's commitment to transparency in government operations. However, the judge did deny TheDCNF's request to depose State Department officials, a decision that may limit the foundation's ability to gather firsthand accounts regarding the security training protocols in question.

The core of TheDCNF's inquiry revolves around the absence of records confirming that Clinton and her aides received mandatory security briefings on the handling of classified materials. This lack of documentation raises questions about compliance with established protocols for safeguarding sensitive information, a critical issue given the high-profile nature of Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

In addition to seeking records pertaining to Clinton, TheDCNF is also pursuing information related to key members of her team, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The inclusion of these individuals highlights the foundation's intent to scrutinize the security training practices of those closest to Clinton during her time in office.

Judge Leon's ruling reflects a growing frustration with the State Department's delays in producing the requested documents. He has set specific deadlines for the release of these records, requiring one third to be made available by September 26 and the remainder by October 10. This timeline aims to expedite the process and ensure that the public has access to information that may shed light on the security protocols followed by Clinton and her aides.

An attorney representing TheDCNF noted the judge's evident frustration with the State Department's obstruction of the FOIA process. This sentiment echoes a broader concern regarding the transparency of government agencies and their responsiveness to public inquiries. The ruling serves as a reminder of the judiciary's role in holding government entities accountable for their actions and ensuring that citizens have access to information that may impact public trust.

State Department officials have acknowledged that their failure to produce the requested documents suggests that the required security courses were not completed by Clinton or her aides. This admission raises significant implications for the handling of classified materials and the adherence to security protocols within the department. The absence of mandatory training could potentially expose sensitive information to risks, a concern that has been at the forefront of discussions surrounding Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure.

As the deadlines set by Judge Leon approach, the State Department faces mounting pressure to comply with the court's order and provide the requested documents. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching consequences, not only for Clinton and her aides but also for the broader discourse on government accountability and the importance of adhering to established security protocols.

The release of these documents may provide critical insights into the security training practices of high-ranking officials and the measures taken to protect classified information. As the public awaits the State Department's response, the implications of this ruling continue to resonate, highlighting the ongoing challenges of transparency and accountability within government agencies.

In conclusion, the federal judge's order for the State Department to release security training documents related to Hillary Clinton and her aides marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing scrutiny of government practices. With deadlines looming and the potential for significant revelations, the case underscores the importance of transparency in the handling of classified materials and the need for accountability among public officials. As the situation unfolds, the public remains keenly interested in the outcomes of this legal battle and the implications it may hold for future governance.",-5.0,-1.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,742.0,-0.041666666666666664,-0.0013477088948787063
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the nation gears up for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the role of moderator Lester Holt has come under scrutiny. Holt will guide the discussion but has made it clear that he will not engage in fact-checking the candidates during the event. This decision raises significant concerns about the integrity of the debate, particularly in light of Trump's history of making unverified claims.

Without on-screen fact-checks from major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, the responsibility for maintaining honesty during the debate falls squarely on Holt's shoulders. This places an immense burden on the moderator, as Trump has been documented to lie on average every three-and-a-half minutes. The absence of real-time fact-checking allows Trump to make assertions without immediate accountability, relying solely on Clinton's responses to challenge his statements.

Clinton's campaign has highlighted the critical need for the moderator to actively challenge falsehoods to ensure a fair and balanced debate. The expectation is that Clinton must perform exceptionally well to counteract Trump's unchallenged claims, which creates a perceived double standard. While Trump can make sweeping statements without immediate pushback, Clinton is expected to exceed expectations to maintain her credibility.

The media's reluctance to fact-check during the debate has been attributed to concerns over ratings and a desire to avoid confrontation with Trump. This reluctance raises questions about the state of journalism in the context of the election. The responsibility of keeping candidates honest should not rest solely on the moderator, especially when one candidate has a documented history of misleading statements.

As the debate approaches, the dynamics of the discussion are becoming increasingly clear. The lack of fact-checking could lead to a scenario where Trump's claims go unchallenged, potentially skewing public perception. This situation not only affects the candidates but also reflects broader issues within the media landscape, where the pursuit of ratings may overshadow the commitment to journalistic integrity.

In a political climate where misinformation can easily spread, the role of the moderator and the media is more crucial than ever. The upcoming debate will serve as a litmus test for how effectively Holt can navigate these challenges and whether Clinton can rise to the occasion in the face of unverified claims. As voters prepare to tune in, the stakes are high, and the implications of this debate will resonate far beyond the stage.",-6.0,9.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,447.0,0.5,0.020134228187919462
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

In a striking revelation, Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has voiced serious concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In her recent statements, Kyle suggests that Clinton's emotional state may be detrimental to her ability to lead effectively.

Kyle claims that Clinton is currently driven by ""anger and rage,"" which she fears could lead to a physical breakdown. This assertion raises alarms about Clinton's overall health and her capacity to handle the pressures of the presidency. According to Kyle, these emotional struggles are not merely fleeting feelings but indicative of deeper issues that could impair Clinton's functionality in a high-stakes political environment.

The concerns extend beyond emotional turmoil, as Kyle asserts that Clinton is experiencing cognitive impairment. She highlights troubling symptoms, including emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty completing tasks. These issues, if true, could significantly hinder Clinton's ability to perform the duties required of a president, raising questions about her readiness for the role.

Kyle's warnings do not stop at cognitive concerns; she also points to Clinton's alleged paranoia and controlling nature. She fears that these traits could culminate in a ""psychological disaster,"" further complicating Clinton's potential presidency. Such claims paint a picture of a candidate whose mental and emotional health may be in jeopardy, which could have far-reaching implications for her campaign and the Democratic Party.

In an effort to shed light on these troubling aspects of Clinton's character and health, Kyle authored the book ""Hillary the Other Woman."" In this work, she aims to provide insight into what she perceives as Clinton's addiction to power, suggesting that this obsession could lead her to jeopardize not only her health but also the integrity of the Democratic Party in pursuit of her ambitions.

These revelations come at a time when Clinton is already facing significant challenges in maintaining a positive public image. Amid ongoing health and character scandals, Kyle's claims add another layer of complexity to the narrative surrounding Clinton's candidacy. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of these concerns could resonate with voters and impact Clinton's campaign strategy moving forward.

As the 2024 presidential race approaches, the scrutiny surrounding Hillary Clinton's fitness for office is likely to intensify, with Kyle's assertions serving as a focal point for ongoing discussions about the former Secretary of State's viability as a candidate.",-13.0,-14.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,468.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.029914529914529916

FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In a landscape often celebrated as a ""nation of immigrants,"" the United States is grappling with the complexities of cultural integration and national identity. While the rich tapestry of diverse backgrounds has contributed to the nation’s strength, there is a growing sentiment that emphasizes the need for unity among its inhabitants. This perspective is echoed by various leaders across North America, who advocate for a more cohesive approach to cultural assimilation.

A recent statement from a Quebec mayor has reignited discussions surrounding the integration of immigrants, particularly Muslims, into Canadian society. The mayor asserts that it is essential for immigrants to adapt to Canadian customs and traditions rather than maintaining their own cultural practices. This call for adaptation is framed within a broader narrative that champions the importance of a unified national identity.

The mayor's remarks highlight a belief that Canadians are not inherently racist or xenophobic; rather, they are open to accepting diverse cultures as long as these cultures do not threaten the foundational aspects of Canadian identity. He insists that while multiculturalism is a valued principle, it should not come at the expense of the core values and traditions that define Canada. The mayor's stance is clear: Canadian culture should remain intact, and any attempts to alter it are unwelcome.

Central to this discussion is the role of religion in public life. The mayor emphasizes that religious practices should remain private and that the implementation of Sharia law should not be accommodated within Canadian legal frameworks. This position reflects a broader concern among some citizens regarding the potential for religious laws to influence or undermine the secular nature of Canadian governance.

In a provocative suggestion, the mayor posits that Muslims who find themselves uncomfortable with Canadian culture should consider returning to Muslim-majority countries. This statement has sparked debate, with critics arguing that it undermines the principles of inclusivity and acceptance that many Canadians hold dear. However, the mayor's comments resonate with those who feel frustrated by what they perceive as attempts by immigrants to control or change local customs.

The sentiment for integration is not confined to Canada. In Texas, legislative measures are being taken to prevent the implementation of Sharia law within the state's judicial system. This move reflects a growing concern among some lawmakers and constituents about the influence of foreign legal systems on American law. The overarching message from these legislative actions is clear: immigrants are encouraged to either integrate into the host culture or consider leaving.

This call for integration raises important questions about the balance between cultural diversity and national identity. Advocates for a more unified approach argue that while immigrants bring valuable perspectives and traditions, it is crucial for them to embrace the customs and values of their new home. The expectation is that by doing so, they contribute to a stronger, more cohesive society.

As discussions around immigration and integration continue to evolve, the emphasis on unity remains a central theme. Leaders in both the United States and Canada are calling for a collective commitment to preserving national identity while navigating the complexities of a multicultural society. The challenge lies in finding a way to honor the contributions of immigrants while ensuring that the core values of the host nation are upheld.

In conclusion, the dialogue surrounding immigration in North America is increasingly focused on the need for unity and integration. As leaders advocate for a cohesive national identity, the expectation for immigrants to adapt to local customs and traditions is becoming more pronounced. The future of cultural integration will depend on the willingness of both immigrants and host communities to engage in meaningful dialogue and foster a sense of belonging for all.",12.0,31.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,686.0,1.1071428571428572,0.04518950437317784

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a striking incident in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through a demonstration. Eyewitnesses initially feared for the man's safety, speculating that he might be the target of a mugging. However, the situation took an unexpected turn when the protesters allowed him to pass without incident.

This unusual encounter unfolded against a backdrop of heightened tensions, as reports have circulated about rioters stopping vehicles and engaging in theft. The man, seemingly unfazed by the gathering crowd, calmly rolled down his window and displayed a handgun to the protesters. This action prompted a swift response from the demonstrators, who quickly dispersed, allowing him to continue on his way.

The incident has ignited a debate about the appropriateness of the man's response. Some observers question whether brandishing a firearm was a necessary measure or if he should have simply driven through the crowd without confrontation. The decision to display a weapon raises concerns about the potential escalation of violence in an already charged atmosphere.

While the man’s actions resulted in a peaceful resolution for him, the implications of such a response in a protest setting are complex. The presence of a firearm can evoke fear and anxiety, potentially leading to a more volatile situation. Critics argue that the display of a weapon could have escalated tensions further, while supporters may view it as a justified means of self-defense in a moment of uncertainty.

As discussions continue regarding the appropriate responses to protests and the rights of individuals in such situations, this incident serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between personal safety and community relations. The actions taken by the driver and the protesters highlight the challenges faced in navigating interactions during times of social unrest. 

Ultimately, this encounter raises important questions about the dynamics of protest, personal safety, and the potential consequences of armed responses in public demonstrations. As communities grapple with these issues, the need for dialogue and understanding remains paramount.",-18.0,-9.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,382.0,-0.5625,-0.02356020942408377

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago's environmentalists are under fire for what critics describe as blatant hypocrisy regarding their support for local development projects. The controversy centers around the contrasting stances taken by these groups on two high-profile initiatives: the proposed George Lucas Museum and the Obama Presidential Center.

Previously, environmentalists vehemently opposed Lucas's museum, arguing that it would disrupt the natural landscape. However, the same groups are now expressing enthusiasm for the construction of the Obama Presidential Center, a project that will involve significant land alteration, including the bulldozing of trees and grass. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly voiced her excitement about the Obama center's construction, raising eyebrows among critics who see this as a glaring contradiction to the environmentalists' own charter.

The juxtaposition of these two projects has led to accusations that leftist groups support environmental issues only until they are personally affected. While the Lucas Museum was slated to be built on a parking lot, the Obama center's development will directly impact green spaces, prompting questions about the consistency of the environmentalists' values.

Moreover, some observers have suggested a racial double standard in the environmentalists' decisions, implying that the support for the Obama center reflects a bias that prioritizes certain projects over others based on their leadership and cultural significance. This perceived inconsistency has sparked a broader debate about the principles guiding environmental advocacy in Chicago, leaving many to wonder if the movement is truly committed to its stated goals or if it is swayed by political affiliations.",3.0,1.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,295.0,0.1111111111111111,0.003389830508474576

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

In a dramatic turn of events, General Stanley McChrystal, the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has resigned following a tense meeting with President Barack Obama. The two leaders have had a history of frequent disagreements regarding the conduct of the war, which culminated in a confrontation in the Oval Office.

During the meeting, President Obama accused McChrystal of failing to support him politically, a claim that struck a chord with the General. In a firm response, McChrystal emphasized that his duty was to support Obama as Commander-in-Chief, not as a politician. This assertion led to McChrystal submitting his resignation, signaling a significant shift in military leadership.

The relationship between Obama and the military has been fraught with tension, with the President reportedly harboring negative sentiments towards military personnel. This backdrop adds weight to the confrontation, as McChrystal's resignation reflects deeper issues within the administration's approach to military strategy.

As the meeting drew to a close, Obama made a parting remark suggesting that McChrystal would be happy to disrespect him after his death. In a display of honor and integrity, McChrystal saluted and replied that he would not stand in line to disrespect anyone, underscoring his commitment to the values of the military.

The resignation of General McChrystal marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding US military operations in Afghanistan and raises questions about the future of military-civilian relations under the Obama administration. As the dust settles, the implications of this high-profile departure will undoubtedly resonate throughout the military and political landscape.",7.0,-3.0,294.0,0.4666666666666667,0.023809523809523808,294.0,-0.2727272727272727,-0.01020408163265306

I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down. It’s what communists do – they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/surprise-70-charlotte-rioters-not-guess-means-video/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus.png,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474651120000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/ag5lEfilclE,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus-890x395_c.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/surprise-70-charlotte-rioters-not-guess-means-video/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Imagine that\u2026 at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has recently become a focal point of unrest, with reports indicating that a significant majority of the rioters involved in the chaos were not local residents. According to sources, at least 70% of those participating in the riots held out-of-state identification, raising concerns about the nature and intent behind the disturbances.

The head of the police union in Charlotte has characterized these individuals as ""professional criminals,"" suggesting that their presence was not merely coincidental but rather indicative of a planned operation aimed at inciting violence and disorder. This assertion aligns with growing claims that outside radicals are being strategically deployed to escalate tensions during protests, particularly those associated with the Black Lives Matter movement.

In stark contrast to the turmoil in Charlotte, protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have remained largely peaceful. Observers note that this difference may stem from a lack of sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement in the region. The dynamics in Tulsa shifted significantly following the charging of a police officer involved in a shooting incident with manslaughter. This legal action appears to have diffused potential tensions, allowing for a more subdued atmosphere during protests.

Charlotte's unique landscape, characterized by a significant presence of Black Lives Matter supporters, has made it more susceptible to riots and unrest. The city's history and ongoing struggles with racial issues have created a fertile ground for protests, which can quickly escalate into violence when external elements are introduced. The influx of out-of-state rioters has only exacerbated these tensions, leading to a chaotic environment that many believe is part of a broader revolutionary agenda.

The implications of these events extend beyond the immediate chaos in Charlotte. The suggestion that organized groups are using outside forces to incite violence raises critical questions about the integrity of protests and the motivations behind them. As communities grapple with the complexities of social justice movements, the presence of ""professional criminals"" seeking to exploit these situations for their own gain complicates the narrative.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a cautionary tale for other cities experiencing similar unrest. The potential for outside influence to disrupt local movements highlights the need for vigilance and awareness among community leaders and law enforcement. As protests continue to unfold across the nation, the lessons learned from Charlotte may prove invaluable in understanding the dynamics at play.

In summary, the unrest in Charlotte, fueled by a significant number of out-of-state rioters, underscores the challenges faced by communities striving for social justice. The characterization of these individuals as ""professional criminals"" and the claims of organized efforts to incite violence suggest a troubling trend that could have lasting implications for the future of protests in America. As cities navigate the complexities of these movements, the need for unity and clarity of purpose remains paramount.",-17.0,-37.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,526.0,-1.85,-0.07034220532319392
Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

The scrutiny intensified following her collapse on September 11th, which has led even supportive media outlets to acknowledge her ongoing health challenges.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC.

In a politically charged environment, the organization Common Defense PAC has emerged as a significant player in the opposition against former President Donald Trump. Funded by George Soros, a prominent figure in liberal philanthropy, Common Defense PAC is part of a broader network identified by Discover the Networks, which has pinpointed 187 groups receiving Soros funding that actively oppose Trump.

Common Defense PAC positions itself as a defender of the rights of all Americans, claiming to stand against Trump’s policies and rhetoric. The organization’s leadership page prominently features military veterans, yet it notably lacks contact information for these individuals, raising questions about the transparency and authenticity of its veteran representation.

The PAC has been vocal in its anti-Trump messaging, sharing content that criticizes the former president and collaborating with other organizations funded by Soros. One of the key strategies employed by Common Defense PAC is the promotion of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which has gained traction and is also utilized by MoveOn.org, a well-known progressive advocacy group.

MoveOn.org’s Political Action has actively advertised the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag, amplifying the message and reaching a wider audience. In a notable campaign, Common Defense PAC participated in a Thunderclap initiative titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump, which successfully reached over 4.5 million people. This campaign garnered support from celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Van Jones, with MoveOn.org serving as the organizer, further enhancing the visibility of the anti-Trump sentiment among veterans and their supporters.

In addition to social media campaigns, Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org organized a protest aimed at urging Senator John McCain to disavow Trump. This event highlighted the PAC’s commitment to mobilizing veterans and their allies against the former president, showcasing a concerted effort to influence public opinion and political discourse.

However, scrutiny has arisen regarding the PAC’s funding and leadership. A review of Common Defense PAC’s July Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing revealed that the organization had only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This singular source of funding raises concerns about the PAC’s financial backing and its ability to represent a diverse array of veteran voices.

Perry O’Brien, the Director of Common Defense PAC, is a left-wing activist and a conscientious objector from the Iraq War. O’Brien has a history of organizing efforts against Trump and has established connections with MoveOn.org, further intertwining the two organizations’ missions. Critics have pointed out that the PAC’s leadership, primarily represented by O’Brien, may not adequately reflect the broader veteran community, particularly given his status as a conscientious objector. This has led to questions about the legitimacy of the PAC’s claims to represent all veterans and their interests.

As Common Defense PAC continues to mobilize against Trump, its strategies and affiliations will likely remain under scrutiny. The organization’s reliance on Soros funding and its connections to other progressive groups like MoveOn.org suggest a coordinated effort to challenge Trump’s influence and policies. However, the criticisms regarding its leadership and representation of veterans may pose challenges to its credibility and effectiveness in the political arena.

In a landscape where political affiliations and funding sources are increasingly scrutinized, Common Defense PAC’s activities will be closely monitored by both supporters and detractors. As the 2024 election cycle approaches, the impact of such organizations on the political discourse surrounding Trump and veteran issues will be a focal point for many observers. The intersection of celebrity endorsements, social media campaigns, and traditional political activism exemplifies the evolving nature of political engagement in contemporary America, particularly among those who identify as veterans. 

As the narrative unfolds, the effectiveness of Common Defense PAC in rallying support against Trump and its ability to authentically represent the voices of veterans will be critical in shaping its future endeavors and influence in the political landscape.",8.0,27.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,731.0,1.08,0.036935704514363885

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has brought to light a controversial decision made by the Obama administration to allocate $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas. This story, which first emerged in 2015, has resurfaced and continues to provoke significant outrage among various groups, raising questions about the implications of such funding.

Critics of the funding argue that it not only supports Islamic terrorists but also raises serious concerns about U.S. foreign aid being directed toward groups that may have ties to terrorism. The allocation of such a substantial amount of taxpayer dollars has ignited a firestorm of debate, with many questioning the rationale behind prioritizing foreign mosque renovations over pressing domestic issues.

Taxpayer advocates have expressed their frustration over what they perceive as reckless spending of money that the U.S. government does not have. They liken the situation to being on a ""gigantic credit card,"" suggesting that the financial burden of this funding will ultimately fall on American taxpayers. This sentiment resonates with many citizens who are grappling with their own economic struggles, as reports indicate that one-third of Americans are currently out of work. The juxtaposition of funding foreign religious sites while many Americans face unemployment has led to widespread anger and discontent.

In defense of the funding, the State Department has stated that the initiative is part of broader efforts to build relationships with Islamic leaders in an attempt to combat extremism. Officials argue that fostering these relationships is crucial for national security and for promoting peace in regions where extremism is prevalent. However, this justification has done little to quell the outrage among critics who remain skeptical of the effectiveness of such an approach.

The controversy surrounding the mosque renovation funding is further compounded by allegations that it is part of a larger agenda to redistribute wealth to Islamic countries. Some commentators suggest that this funding is indicative of a strategy to influence U.S. demographics through the resettlement of Muslim refugees. This perspective has fueled fears among certain segments of the population who believe that such policies could lead to significant changes in the cultural and social fabric of the nation.

As the investigation continues to gain traction, the implications of the Obama administration's funding decisions are becoming increasingly clear. The allocation of $770 million for overseas mosque renovations raises critical questions about the priorities of U.S. foreign aid and the potential consequences of supporting foreign entities that may not align with American values.

The ongoing economic struggles faced by many Americans have only intensified the scrutiny of this funding. With a significant portion of the population experiencing financial hardship, the decision to invest taxpayer dollars in foreign religious sites appears to many as a misallocation of resources. The frustration is palpable, as citizens demand accountability and a reevaluation of how their tax dollars are spent.

In conclusion, the CBS investigation into the Obama administration's mosque renovation funding has reignited a contentious debate about U.S. foreign aid, national security, and the economic challenges facing American citizens. As the story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how policymakers will respond to the growing calls for transparency and a reassessment of priorities in the allocation of taxpayer funds. The outrage surrounding this issue underscores the need for a more nuanced discussion about the intersection of foreign aid, domestic welfare, and the responsibilities of government to its citizens.",-13.0,-31.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,625.0,-1.4090909090909092,-0.0496

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

The timing of this message is particularly significant, given the recent uptick in terrorist attacks within the U.S. The billboards aim to counteract the agenda of these groups, which thrive on creating an atmosphere of fear. By showcasing the Marines' readiness to fight back, the campaign seeks to empower citizens and reinforce a sense of security in the face of adversity.

Critics of the campaign, particularly from liberal circles, have expressed disdain for the message conveyed by the billboards. Some argue that the initiative prioritizes a confrontational stance over a more diplomatic approach to dealing with terrorism. However, supporters of the campaign assert that such reactions reflect a troubling tendency to appease terrorists rather than prioritize American self-defense. The billboards stand as a testament to the belief that if people refuse to be afraid, terrorists ultimately lose their power.

The overarching message of the campaign is one of resilience and defiance against the threats posed by terrorism. It emphasizes that the Marines are not only prepared to confront these challenges but are also committed to protecting the values and freedoms that define the nation. In a time when fear can easily take hold, the billboards serve as a rallying cry for Americans to stand strong and united against those who seek to undermine their way of life.

As the nation grapples with the realities of terrorism, the Marine Corps' initiative underscores a critical point: the fight against fear is as important as the fight against the terrorists themselves. By fostering a sense of courage and readiness, the Marines aim to inspire a collective resolve that can withstand the pressures of intimidation and violence. In doing so, they remind us all that true strength lies in the refusal to be cowed by fear.",-53.0,-22.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,471.0,-1.1578947368421053,-0.04670912951167728

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has been rocked by severe rioting that has led to widespread looting and violence, prompting state officials to take decisive action. In response to the escalating chaos, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to restore order in the city.

The unrest has not only disrupted daily life but has also raised significant concerns about public safety and community responsibility. In a bold move, state officials announced that individuals caught participating in the riots or engaging in violent behavior will face severe consequences, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This measure aims to deter further violence and hold individuals accountable for their actions.

The implications of this announcement extend beyond adults. Minor children involved in rioting will face similar repercussions, which could adversely affect their parents as well. Parents of minors caught in the midst of the unrest may lose state benefits, face referrals to social services, and could even risk losing custody of their children. City official Wilson Stewart emphasized the importance of parental responsibility during a press conference, urging parents to take an active role in monitoring their children's activities.

The situation has been particularly alarming, as many of those detained during the riots are high school students. In light of this, parents are being urged to closely monitor their children's whereabouts and enforce a mandatory curfew. The curfew is part of a broader strategy to help restore peace and order in Charlotte, as officials work to quell the unrest that has gripped the city.

The announcement of the curfew and the potential loss of benefits for both individuals and their families is intended to encourage greater parental involvement and community accountability. Officials hope that by holding parents responsible for their children's actions, they can foster a sense of responsibility and deter future incidents of violence.

As the National Guard works alongside local law enforcement to maintain order, the city of Charlotte faces a challenging road ahead. The combination of rioting, looting, and the subsequent state of emergency has left many residents feeling unsafe and uncertain about the future. The measures being implemented are seen as necessary steps to restore peace, but they also raise questions about the long-term implications for families and the community as a whole.

In the wake of these events, the city is calling for unity and cooperation among residents to help heal the divisions that have led to such unrest. As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of the riots, officials are hopeful that the community can come together to address the underlying issues that have fueled the violence and work towards a more peaceful future.

The situation remains fluid, and city officials are closely monitoring developments as they strive to bring stability back to Charlotte. The hope is that with the combined efforts of law enforcement, community leaders, and families, the city can emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient.",-33.0,-7.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,555.0,-0.3333333333333333,-0.012612612612612612

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey is under increasing scrutiny and may be facing resignation as criticism mounts over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. The controversy has intensified following revelations that Comey granted immunity to several of Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills. Reports indicate that Mills allegedly did not fully cooperate with the investigation, raising questions about the integrity of the inquiry.

The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28, where Comey will be called to account for his actions during the investigation. This hearing is part of a broader congressional effort to scrutinize the handling of the email scandal, which has been a contentious issue in American politics. Lawmakers are eager to understand the rationale behind Comey's decisions, particularly the controversial immunity deals that have drawn significant criticism.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has been vocal in his calls for Comey's resignation, questioning his fitness for office. DiGenova has characterized the investigation as inadequate, suggesting that it resembled a ""protected investigation"" rather than a thorough and impartial inquiry. His comments reflect a growing sentiment among some lawmakers and legal experts who believe that Comey's actions may have compromised the integrity of the FBI.

As the investigation continues, Comey has been issued a subpoena by Congress to provide documents related to the inquiry. This subpoena comes after Comey previously failed to deliver requested materials, further fueling concerns about his transparency and accountability. The pressure is mounting for Comey to clarify his decisions and the rationale behind granting immunity to key figures in the investigation.

The implications of Comey's actions extend beyond the immediate investigation, raising questions about his loyalty to Clinton and the potential impact on his career. Critics argue that his decisions may have been influenced by political considerations, which could undermine public trust in the FBI. As the hearings approach, the stakes are high for Comey, who must navigate a complex political landscape while defending his actions.

The upcoming hearing is expected to draw significant attention, as lawmakers seek to uncover the truth behind the investigation and its handling. Comey's responses will be closely scrutinized, and the outcome could have lasting repercussions for both him and the FBI. As the nation watches, the pressure on Comey continues to build, with calls for accountability echoing throughout Congress.

In a climate of heightened political tension, the investigation into Clinton's emails remains a flashpoint, and Comey's role in it is under the microscope. With the House Judiciary Committee poised to take action, the future of Comey's directorship hangs in the balance as he prepares to face lawmakers and defend his controversial decisions.",-17.0,-18.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,509.0,-0.9,-0.03536345776031434

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has come under intense scrutiny for its alleged support of the Islamic State (ISIS) and its involvement in human trafficking. As a significant donor to Hillary Clinton's campaign, the kingdom's actions have raised serious ethical questions about the relationship between U.S. politicians and foreign powers known for human rights violations.

The concerns surrounding Saudi Arabia are compounded by the fact that the majority of the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks were from the kingdom. This troubling connection has led many to question the rationale behind continued U.S. support for a nation that has been linked to terrorism and extremist ideologies. Critics argue that the United States must reassess its alliances, particularly when those partnerships may inadvertently contribute to global instability and human suffering.

Recent reports have surfaced indicating that Saudi Arabia is involved in the auctioning of ISIS sex slaves, a horrifying practice that highlights the extent of human rights abuses occurring within the region. Victims of these auctions include women from Iraq, Syria, and various Western nations, underscoring the international dimensions of this crisis. The Islamic State has a notorious history of abusing and trafficking sex slaves, with a particular focus on targeting vulnerable populations such as Yazidi girls and non-Muslim women. This systematic exploitation raises urgent questions about the complicity of nations that maintain ties with Saudi Arabia.

The implications of these reports are profound, as they reveal a disturbing intersection of politics, human rights, and international relations. The ongoing human trafficking and abuse of women and children in conflict zones demand immediate attention and action from global leaders. The article calls for an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia, arguing that such transactions only serve to perpetuate the cycle of violence and oppression. It urges politicians to distance themselves from the kingdom, emphasizing the moral imperative to prioritize human rights over political and economic interests.

The complicity of Western leaders, including the current president, in these ongoing abuses cannot be overlooked. By continuing to engage with a nation that is implicated in such egregious violations, they risk undermining their own commitments to human rights and justice. The author expresses a strong opposition to electing leaders who turn a blind eye to the plight of women and children affected by these atrocities, calling for a reevaluation of political alliances that prioritize profit over people.

As the world grapples with the consequences of these actions, it is crucial for citizens to hold their leaders accountable. The plight of those suffering under the weight of human trafficking and violence must not be ignored. The article serves as a rallying cry for individuals to demand change, urging them to advocate for policies that protect the most vulnerable members of society.

In conclusion, the situation in Saudi Arabia presents a complex challenge for the international community. The intertwining of political donations, terrorism, and human rights abuses calls for a critical reassessment of alliances and policies. As reports of human trafficking and the exploitation of women continue to emerge, it is imperative that leaders take a stand against these injustices. The time for action is now, and the voices of those affected must be amplified in the halls of power. The future of countless lives hangs in the balance, and it is the responsibility of all to ensure that human dignity is upheld in the face of such overwhelming adversity.",-30.0,-58.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,640.0,-2.4166666666666665,-0.090625
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the election season unfolded with intense exchanges between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump. The event, moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt, was characterized by a series of contentious moments that highlighted the stark differences between the two candidates.

As the debate progressed, Holt faced criticism for his approach, particularly for interrupting Trump to ""fact-check"" his statements. Many observers noted that several of Holt's fact-checks were inaccurate, raising questions about the moderator's impartiality. One of the most heated moments came when Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War, a claim that Trump vehemently denied. This exchange underscored the tension between the candidates and the challenges of addressing complex foreign policy issues in a debate format.

Interestingly, while Holt pressed Trump on his past statements regarding the Iraq War, he did not question Clinton about her own vote in favor of the war. This decision drew scrutiny, as it appeared to focus the debate primarily on Trump’s history rather than providing a balanced examination of both candidates' positions.

Following the debate, Trump participated in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, where he elaborated on his views regarding the Iraq invasion. Trump revealed that he had reservations about the decision to invade Iraq, suggesting that more deliberation was necessary and that the United States should have waited for guidance from the United Nations. This revelation added another layer to the ongoing discussion about the candidates' foreign policy credentials.

The debate and its aftermath sparked a broader conversation about the role of the mainstream media in the electoral process. Critics argued that the media's focus on discrediting Trump detracted from the opportunity for a substantive debate on the issues at hand. Instead of fostering a dialogue that would allow voters to make informed decisions, the media's approach was seen as an attempt to undermine Trump's candidacy.

Throughout the debate, Trump was noted for standing his ground against both Clinton and the media. His assertive demeanor and refusal to back down in the face of challenging questions resonated with his supporters, who viewed him as a candidate willing to confront the establishment.

As the election season continues, the dynamics established in this first debate are likely to shape the discourse moving forward. With both candidates presenting starkly different visions for the future, voters will be closely watching how these debates evolve and what they reveal about the candidates' positions on critical issues.",-9.0,-8.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,473.0,-0.4444444444444444,-0.016913319238900635
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The Birther movement, which gained traction during Barack Obama's presidency, has sparked intense debate about the implications of its claims and whether they reflect a deeper bias against the former president. Central to this discussion is a 2004 article published by Breitbart, which controversially stated, ""Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate."" This assertion came at a time when Obama was poised to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his rival, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a scandal.

The article raises significant questions about the authenticity of Obama's birthplace, particularly in light of a 1991 promotional booklet from Obama's literary agency. This booklet described him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii,” a characterization that has fueled speculation and debate. The booklet was distributed to colleagues in the publishing industry and included a biography of Obama alongside other authors, further entrenching the narrative of his origins.

Despite the controversy, Obama never publicly refuted the claims made in the Breitbart article or the details outlined in the 1991 booklet. This silence has led to questions about the motivations behind the statements and whether they were a deliberate manipulation for personal gain. Critics argue that if Obama misrepresented his birthplace, it raises concerns about his eligibility for the presidency and the integrity of his public persona.

The implications of the Birther movement extend beyond mere speculation about Obama's origins. It invites a broader examination of why a sitting president would misrepresent such a fundamental aspect of his identity if he were indeed a valid American citizen. The movement has often been criticized as a reflection of racial bias, suggesting that the scrutiny faced by Obama was not merely about his birthplace but also about the color of his skin and the challenges he posed to traditional political norms.

As the debate continues, the article concludes with a provocative assertion: if one claim about Obama's origins is a lie, then it raises the question of whether other claims, particularly regarding his eligibility for the presidency, could also be false. This line of questioning underscores the complexities surrounding the Birther movement and its implications for American politics, identity, and the ongoing discourse about race and representation in leadership roles. The legacy of these claims continues to resonate, prompting reflection on the intersection of truth, bias, and the narratives that shape public perception.",-18.0,-15.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,453.0,-1.0,-0.033112582781456956

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In a recent debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took the stage with an air of confidence that caught the attention of viewers and commentators alike. Notably, Clinton appeared unusually prepared, managing to avoid her previous habit of coughing or reaching for water, which had become a point of concern in past public appearances. However, her performance was not without controversy, as social media users quickly began to speculate about a possible flesh-colored device visible in her ear.

The device sparked a flurry of online discussion, with many users questioning whether it was an earpiece, a trick of light, a fashion accessory, or even a ""Cough prevention machine."" The speculation intensified as viewers scrutinized the footage, leading to a variety of theories about its purpose. Some suggested that the device could be a hearing aid, while others dismissed it as merely a reflection caused by the bright television lights illuminating the stage.

In response to the growing chatter, Clinton's campaign swiftly denied the earpiece claims. A spokesperson attributed the appearance of the device to reflections from the TV lights, aiming to quell the rumors that had taken hold on social media. Despite the campaign's efforts to clarify the situation, the debate over the device continued to gain traction, fueled in part by an email from the WikiLeaks archive. This email referenced a discussion about an earpiece between Clinton and her close aide, Huma Abedin, further igniting speculation about the former Secretary of State's debate preparation.

Commentators have weighed in on the situation, with some taking a humorous approach. One commentator, Woods, suggested that Clinton might need assistance to lie effectively, poking fun at the ongoing narrative surrounding her public persona. This lighthearted jab reflects a broader skepticism that has often surrounded Clinton, particularly during her political career.

While the debate over the device rages on, it is important to note that there is currently no concrete evidence to support the claims of an earpiece. Many observers believe that the device could simply be a hearing aid or a benign reflection, rather than a tool for clandestine communication. The lack of definitive proof has left room for speculation, allowing the narrative to persist in the public consciousness.

As the debate continues, Clinton's performance and the surrounding controversy serve as a reminder of the intense scrutiny faced by public figures, particularly in the age of social media. The incident highlights how quickly rumors can spread and how easily perceptions can be shaped by visual cues, regardless of their actual significance.

In conclusion, while the debate showcased Clinton's preparedness and composure, the speculation surrounding the device in her ear has overshadowed her performance. As the public continues to dissect the event, it remains to be seen whether this controversy will have any lasting impact on her campaign or public image. For now, the discussion serves as a testament to the complexities of modern political discourse and the challenges faced by candidates in the spotlight.",-5.0,10.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,564.0,0.47619047619047616,0.01773049645390071
