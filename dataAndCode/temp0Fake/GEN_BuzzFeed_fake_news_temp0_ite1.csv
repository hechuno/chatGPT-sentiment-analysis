Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Former President Bill Clinton's recent remarks regarding donors to the Clinton Foundation have ignited a firestorm of negative headlines, drawing parallels to accusations made by Donald Trump. The controversy centers around Clinton's acknowledgment that while foundation donors may seek favors, it does not imply that they will receive them. This statement has been interpreted by some as a suggestion of a pay-to-play scenario, echoing Trump's long-standing claims about the foundation's operations.

In an interview with NPR, Clinton sought to clarify his position, emphasizing that the mere act of asking for favors does not guarantee that those requests will be fulfilled. This distinction, however, has not quelled the backlash. Critics have seized upon the implications of his comments, framing them within the context of Trump's accusations, which have long suggested that the Clinton Foundation operates on a quid pro quo basis.

Adding fuel to the fire, leaked emails have surfaced indicating that some donors to the Clinton Foundation were granted meetings with influential figures. While these revelations have raised eyebrows, they have not provided concrete evidence to substantiate claims of a pay-to-play arrangement. The lack of definitive proof has left many questioning the validity of the accusations against Clinton and his foundation.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump's own charitable foundation has come under scrutiny for its practices. Reports indicate that Trump has not personally donated to his foundation since 2008, raising questions about his commitment to charitable giving. Furthermore, allegations have emerged suggesting that Trump may have misused charity funds for personal purchases, prompting an investigation led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. This investigation has cast a shadow over Trump's philanthropic endeavors, highlighting a potential misuse of funds that could undermine his credibility.

The media landscape has played a significant role in shaping public perception of both Clinton and Trump. Media Matters, a progressive research organization, has pointed out a perceived double standard in the coverage of the two candidates. Recent reports have tended to focus on relatively minor issues concerning Clinton, while significant developments regarding Trump's foundation have received less attention. This disparity in coverage has the potential to impact Clinton's campaign negatively, as voters may be more inclined to view her in a negative light based on the headlines that dominate the news cycle.

The implications of Clinton's comments and the surrounding media coverage are significant as the political landscape continues to evolve. With the 2024 election on the horizon, both candidates are under intense scrutiny, and the narratives surrounding their respective foundations could play a pivotal role in shaping voter opinions. Clinton's attempt to clarify her foundation's operations may not be enough to mitigate the damage caused by the headlines, especially as Trump continues to leverage these controversies to bolster his own narrative.

As the political discourse heats up, it remains to be seen how these developments will influence the broader electoral landscape. Voters are increasingly aware of the complexities surrounding charitable foundations and the potential for conflicts of interest. The ongoing investigations into Trump's foundation and the scrutiny of Clinton's comments will likely remain focal points in the media, shaping the narratives that define the candidates as they vie for public support.

In conclusion, Bill Clinton's statement regarding foundation donors has sparked a significant controversy, aligning with Donald Trump's accusations and raising questions about the integrity of both candidates' charitable endeavors. As the media continues to dissect these issues, the impact on Clinton's campaign could be profound, particularly if the perceived double standard in coverage persists. With the election approaching, both candidates must navigate these turbulent waters carefully, as the narratives surrounding their foundations could prove decisive in the eyes of voters.",6.0,-9.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,697.0,-0.34615384615384615,-0.01291248206599713
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, alleging that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially increasing the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients. The report, titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, and it scrutinizes the actions of one of the Clinton Foundation's most significant initiatives aimed at aiding AIDS victims.

CHAI, established to improve access to HIV/AIDS treatment, has been recognized for its efforts in combating the epidemic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the new report raises serious concerns about the quality of the drugs distributed under its auspices, particularly those sourced from Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, a key distributor for CHAI.

The report delves into the relationship between Bill Clinton and Ranbaxy, which has been under intense scrutiny for its manufacturing practices. Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower from Ranbaxy, played a pivotal role in exposing the company's malpractices, which ultimately led to a landmark lawsuit. In 2013, Ranbaxy pleaded guilty to multiple criminal counts related to fraud and the distribution of adulterated drugs, resulting in a hefty $500 million fine. The Department of Justice stated that the diluted drugs posed increased risks to patients, raising alarm bells about the implications for those relying on these medications.

Rep. Blackburn has expressed deep concern over the potential impact of CHAI's actions, questioning how many lives may have been lost due to the distribution of substandard drugs. The report highlights the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, despite the company's known quality control issues, and raises critical questions about the oversight and accountability of CHAI in ensuring the safety and efficacy of the drugs it distributed.

One of the most troubling aspects of the report is the uncertainty surrounding the number of AIDS patients who may have received compromised drugs. In 2007, ProPublica reported that the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, further complicating the narrative of accountability and responsibility in the distribution of HIV/AIDS treatments.

Thakur, the whistleblower, has emphasized that the effectiveness of anti-retroviral drugs is severely compromised if the actual content does not match what is stated on the label. This revelation underscores the potential dangers faced by patients who were prescribed these medications, as they may have been led to believe they were receiving effective treatment when, in fact, they were not.

Ranbaxy's manufacturing practices have drawn scrutiny from various health organizations, including the World Health Organization, which raised concerns about the quality of the drugs produced by the company. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning letter to Ranbaxy regarding its quality control issues, further highlighting the risks associated with the drugs distributed by CHAI.

Despite the mounting evidence of Ranbaxy's problems, CHAI continued to distribute its drugs, and Bill Clinton publicly praised the company in 2013. This raises questions about the decision-making processes within CHAI and the extent to which the organization prioritized patient safety over partnerships with pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Thakur attempted to communicate his concerns regarding the quality of Ranbaxy's drugs to CHAI and the Clinton Foundation but reported receiving no response. This lack of communication raises further questions about the transparency and accountability of CHAI in addressing potential issues related to drug quality.

In 2010, CHAI became a separate entity from the Clinton Foundation, yet it maintains close ties with overlapping board members and staff. This relationship complicates the narrative of independence and raises concerns about the influence of the Clinton Foundation on CHAI's operations and decision-making processes.

The report also suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards through a 2000 executive order regarding intellectual property policies for HIV/AIDS medicines. This executive order is posited as a potential factor that may have contributed to the distribution of substandard drugs, as it may have prioritized access over quality.

CHAI began distributing generic HIV drugs from multiple foreign manufacturers, including Ranbaxy, in 2003. The decision to source drugs from various manufacturers was likely intended to increase access to treatment, but the report raises critical questions about the oversight mechanisms in place to ensure the quality and safety of these medications.

Furthermore, the report highlights potential corruption and financial benefits to the Clinton Foundation stemming from partnerships with drug manufacturers. This aspect of the investigation raises ethical concerns about the motivations behind CHAI's actions and the potential for conflicts of interest in its operations.

Rep. Blackburn has expressed concern over the emotional impact on healthcare workers and patients due to the false hopes created by the Clinton Foundation. The implications of distributing substandard drugs extend beyond physical health, affecting the mental and emotional well-being of those who relied on these treatments for their survival.

As the report continues to circulate, it is likely to spark further debate and scrutiny regarding the actions of CHAI and the Clinton Foundation. The allegations of distributing compromised HIV/AIDS drugs raise significant ethical questions about the responsibilities of organizations involved in global health initiatives and the need for rigorous oversight to protect vulnerable populations.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report presents a troubling narrative regarding the distribution of HIV/AIDS drugs by the Clinton Health Access Initiative. With allegations of ""watered-down"" medications and a lack of accountability, the report calls into question the integrity of one of the Clinton Foundation's most significant initiatives. As the investigation unfolds, the implications for public health and the trust placed in global health organizations will be closely monitored. The potential consequences for those affected by the distribution of substandard drugs underscore the critical importance of ensuring that healthcare initiatives prioritize patient safety and efficacy above all else.",-6.0,10.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1064.0,0.2777777777777778,0.009398496240601503
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van after being removed from the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. This incident has ignited a wave of speculation regarding her health and the implications for her upcoming political engagements.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, but observers noted a striking difference in her appearance. Many remarked that she looked noticeably lighter and more vibrant than before. However, the most significant change was her nose, which appeared to have undergone a transformation to a Roman-type shape, contrasting sharply with her previously recognized Nordic nose.

This alteration has led to rampant speculation about the authenticity of the individual seen in Chelsea's apartment. Observers pointed out that the stand-in for Clinton appeared younger and notably lacked a mole that has long been a characteristic feature above her right lip. This absence has fueled theories that the individual seen may not be the real Hillary Clinton but rather a double or clone.

As the political landscape heats up with the upcoming election, questions are being raised about Clinton's ability to participate in debates, particularly with her rival, Donald Trump. The implications of her health issues have led to concerns that the clone or stand-in may handle most public appearances leading up to the election. This situation has prompted observers to closely monitor any significant changes in her appearance during public events, as they seek to discern the authenticity of the individual representing Clinton.

The speculation surrounding Clinton's health and appearance has also raised broader concerns about her potential role in her administration if elected. Many are questioning whether the real Hillary Clinton will be involved in decision-making processes or if her double will conduct all public appearances and decisions on her behalf. This uncertainty has led to a growing sense of unease among her supporters and critics alike.

The situation has drawn comparisons to previous speculation surrounding former President Barack Obama, where questions of transparency and authenticity were similarly raised. The parallels have not gone unnoticed, as observers express concern over the implications of a lack of clarity regarding the true state of Clinton's health and her capacity to fulfill the responsibilities of the presidency.

As the election approaches, the discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and appearance is likely to intensify. The public's perception of her ability to lead and engage in critical political debates will be influenced by the ongoing speculation about her well-being. The potential for a stand-in to take on a significant role in her campaign raises questions about the authenticity of political representation in the current climate.

In light of these developments, it is essential for voters to remain vigilant and informed about the candidates they support. The implications of health issues and the authenticity of public figures can have far-reaching consequences for the political landscape. As the situation unfolds, observers are advised to keep a close eye on any significant changes in Clinton's appearance and public engagements.

The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. As the political arena continues to evolve, the questions surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and the authenticity of her public appearances will remain a focal point of discussion leading up to the election. The public's demand for transparency and clarity in political representation has never been more critical, and the unfolding narrative surrounding Clinton's health will undoubtedly shape the discourse in the months to come.",8.0,27.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,657.0,1.08,0.0410958904109589
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In the landscape of American politics, few figures have sparked as much debate and controversy as Donald Trump. His statements regarding immigration and terrorism have drawn both fervent support and vehement opposition, raising critical questions about the implications of his proposed policies and rhetoric.

One of Trump's most contentious proposals is the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, aimed at keeping out immigrants whom he has labeled as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" This characterization has not only polarized public opinion but has also ignited discussions about the broader implications of such language on societal attitudes toward immigrants. Critics argue that this rhetoric fosters an environment of fear and hostility, while supporters claim it is a necessary measure for national security.

In addition to his views on immigration, Trump has suggested the creation of a national registry for Muslims, a proposal that has drawn comparisons to historical actions taken against Jews in Nazi Germany. This suggestion has raised alarms among civil rights advocates, who warn that such measures could lead to discrimination and the erosion of fundamental rights. The implications of a national registry extend beyond mere policy; they touch on the very fabric of American identity and values.

Trump's approach to combating terrorism has also been marked by extreme proposals. He has advocated for measures that include the idea of killing the families of terrorists, a stance that has been met with widespread condemnation. Critics argue that such actions would not only be morally reprehensible but could also violate international law and human rights standards. The potential for such extreme measures raises questions about the ethical boundaries of counter-terrorism strategies.

Amidst these controversial proposals, Trump's Senior Communications Advisor has stated that the candidate is more focused on combating the ""narratives"" of former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton than on addressing terrorism itself. This focus on narrative over substance has led to concerns about the effectiveness of Trump's proposed policies in genuinely addressing the complexities of terrorism and national security.

Trump has been particularly critical of the Obama administration, accusing it of allowing immigrants from dangerous countries to gain U.S. citizenship and of increasing the number of Syrian refugees. He claims that the threat of radical Islamic terrorism has grown under the leadership of Obama and Clinton, asserting that they do not instill fear in enemies like ISIS. This narrative of fear has resonated with many voters, but it also raises questions about the accuracy of Trump's claims and the potential for scapegoating entire communities.

In a further extension of his rhetoric, Trump has expressed a belief that Muslims should take on the responsibility of reporting suspicious individuals within their communities. This suggestion implies a collective responsibility among Muslims, which some argue unfairly places the burden of national security on a specific religious group. The potential for such expectations to lead to increased scrutiny and discrimination against Muslims is a significant concern for many civil rights advocates.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, there are growing concerns about how Trump would define terrorism and the potential for mass actions against Muslims during his presidency. The recent attacks in New York and New Jersey, which were committed by an American citizen, highlight the complexity of rights and citizenship in the context of national security. These incidents serve as a reminder that the threat of terrorism is not confined to any one group or ideology, complicating the narrative that Trump has presented.

The implications of Trump's rhetoric are profound, and many warn that if he were to assume office, the consequences could be severe. The potential for increased discrimination, the erosion of civil liberties, and the fostering of an environment of fear are all concerns that have been raised by critics of Trump's approach. The stakes are high, and the impact of his policies could reverberate through American society for years to come.

As the nation approaches the upcoming election, there is a growing call to action for voters to participate in the democratic process. Many believe that it is crucial to prevent Trump from winning the presidency, arguing that his controversial statements and proposed policies pose a threat to the values and principles that underpin American democracy. Engaging in the electoral process, advocating for inclusive policies, and standing against divisive rhetoric are seen as essential steps in safeguarding the future of the nation.

In conclusion, Donald Trump's controversial statements regarding immigration and terrorism have sparked a national conversation about the implications of his proposed policies.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, promoting the concept of One World Government and globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have emerged regarding potential pay-to-play corruption involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the foundation's true purpose and financial practices. In response to these claims, the Clinton campaign has initially focused on highlighting the foundation's positive contributions to various charitable causes. However, critics argue that the foundation has primarily functioned as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates.

The Clinton Foundation, established to address global health, education, and environmental issues, has faced scrutiny over its financial allocations. Critics contend that while the foundation was required to maintain a charitable appearance, a significant portion of its resources was directed towards administrative costs rather than direct charitable grants. According to IRS filings, only 5.7% of the foundation's budget in 2014 was allocated to charitable grants, raising concerns about its operational transparency.

In 2014, the Clinton Foundation reported expenditures of nearly $91.3 million, yet less than $5.2 million was designated for charitable grants. The financial breakdown reveals that $34.8 million was spent on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, while an additional $50.4 million went towards ""other expenses."" This allocation of funds has led to allegations that the foundation's primary function was not charitable work but rather a means for the Clintons to generate substantial income.

Further compounding these concerns, charitable spending by the foundation decreased by 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite an increase of $30 million in revenue. This decline in charitable contributions coincided with a $5 million rise in salaries and employee benefits, as well as an uptick in ""other expenses."" Such financial trends have prompted critics to question the foundation's commitment to its stated mission.

The allegations suggest that Hillary Clinton may have leveraged her position as Secretary of State to benefit the foundation financially, further blurring the lines between public service and personal gain. As the scrutiny intensifies, the Clinton campaign continues to defend the foundation's work, but the financial practices and the allocation of resources remain a focal point of criticism.

In conclusion, the Clinton Foundation's financial operations have raised significant concerns about its role as a charitable organization. With allegations of pay-to-play corruption looming, the foundation's legacy and the Clintons' financial dealings are under increasing examination, prompting calls for greater transparency and accountability.",25.0,13.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,449.0,0.8125,0.028953229398663696
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

The incident, which involved Clinton convulsing and being assisted into her van, initially prompted her campaign to attribute the episode to the heat. However, it was later revealed that the temperature in New York City that day was a mild 74 degrees, raising questions about the true nature of her health.

Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea's apartment, passing multiple hospitals en route, which further fueled speculation about her condition. As she addressed supporters at the rally, doubts emerged regarding the authenticity of the event. Observers noted unusual camera placements directed at the audience, leading to suspicions that the rally may have been staged to project an image of recovery.

Additional videos surfaced, providing analysis that suggested the rally could have been faked. A C-Span video was referenced to confirm that the original footage had not been altered, adding to the ongoing debate about the legitimacy of Clinton's public appearances.

Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the fictional movie ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" gains traction in popular culture, it serves as a satirical lens through which to examine the media's portrayal of Hillary Clinton. The film's title, a play on the classic ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" evokes a sense of dark humor about the former Secretary of State's health and political aspirations. However, beneath the surface of this comedic premise lies a serious critique of how media outlets have handled Clinton's health issues, often with an overly supportive lens that many believe downplays significant concerns.

The author of this critique argues that the media's affection for Clinton has led to a troubling lack of transparency regarding her health. While many outlets have painted a rosy picture of her well-being, the author contends that Clinton is, in fact, severely ill. Dismissing her public explanations about her health as inadequate, the article raises alarms about the implications of her condition for her political future.

A key point of concern is Clinton's past medical history, which includes a significant brain blood clot in 2003. This incident, along with the involvement of a traveling physician, raises questions about the seriousness of her current health status. The author suggests that Clinton may be grappling with more than just the typical ailments of aging, hinting at the possibility of seizures or even Parkinson's disease. The use of blue-tinted glasses, often seen on Clinton, is cited as a potential indicator of underlying neurological issues, further fueling speculation about her health.

Criticism is also directed at the Clinton campaign for its lack of transparency regarding her medical condition. The author argues that this opacity only serves to reinforce public distrust in Clinton's fitness for the presidency. As her poll numbers reportedly decline, exacerbated by her controversial remarks about Donald Trump's supporters, the author posits that the combination of health concerns and political missteps could have dire consequences for her campaign.

The article highlights a perceived hypocrisy in Clinton's statements and her past associations, suggesting that her political ambitions are at odds with the reality of her health struggles. While the author expresses a degree of compassion for Clinton's personal challenges, there is a clear undercurrent of criticism regarding her decision to pursue the presidency despite these issues. This duality of sentiment reflects a broader societal struggle to reconcile empathy for an individual's health with the demands of public service.

In a striking juxtaposition, the author mentions a prayer for Clinton's political downfall, while simultaneously wishing her well in her private life. This complex emotional landscape underscores the tension between personal well-being and public accountability, particularly for someone in a position of such influence.

As the article draws to a close, it leaves readers with a sardonic remark about Clinton's potential future in prison, encapsulating the author's skepticism about her political viability. The blend of humor and serious critique serves to highlight the ongoing debate surrounding Clinton's health and the media's role in shaping public perception.

In summary, the anticipation for ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" not only reflects a cultural moment but also invites a deeper examination of the narratives surrounding Hillary Clinton. The interplay of health, media coverage, and political ambition creates a complex tapestry that continues to evolve, leaving many to ponder the implications for both Clinton and the broader political landscape.",-18.0,-13.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,648.0,-0.6190476190476191,-0.020061728395061727

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant farewell address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama expressed deep concerns about the ongoing battle against ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. His remarks underscored a sobering reality: the limitations of U.S. military power in effectively combating these threats. Referring to ISIS as a ""JV team,"" Obama highlighted the significant growth of the Islamic State and the alarming increase in militants, which he argued render a viable military solution nearly impossible.

Obama's address was marked by a candid acknowledgment of the challenges facing the U.S. as it attempts to act as a global police force. He stated unequivocally that the U.S. has no chance of winning the battle against ISIS through military means alone. This assertion reflects a broader understanding of the complexities involved in addressing the root causes of extremism, which cannot be resolved solely through force.

The former president emphasized the necessity of honesty in discussing the nature of these conflicts. He called for a shift in focus towards collaboration with those who aspire to build rather than destroy. This perspective is crucial in recognizing that the fight against ISIS is not merely a military endeavor but also a struggle for hearts and minds.

While acknowledging the military aspect of dealing with ISIS, Obama categorized Syria as a region where no ultimate military victory can be achieved. He advocated for a diplomatic approach to halt violence, deliver humanitarian aid, and support political settlements that honor the dignity and diversity of the affected populations. This call for diplomacy reflects a nuanced understanding of the geopolitical landscape and the need for sustainable solutions.

However, the address also sparked criticism of the liberal perspective that tends to downplay the connection between radical Islam and violence. Detractors argue that this viewpoint has contributed to the current predicament, as it often overlooks the real threat posed by radical ideologies. The failure to confront the realities of radical Islam, they contend, has hindered effective responses to the challenges posed by groups like ISIS.

In light of these concerns, the author of the critique calls for decisive action against radical Islam. They assert that politeness and fear of offending should not impede necessary measures to address this pressing issue. The urgency of the situation demands a robust response that acknowledges the complexities of the conflict while remaining resolute in the face of extremism.

Obama's final address to the U.N. serves as a reminder of the multifaceted nature of the fight against ISIS and the importance of a comprehensive strategy that includes military, diplomatic, and humanitarian efforts. As the world grapples with the realities of radical extremism, the need for honest dialogue and decisive action has never been more critical. The challenges ahead are daunting, but a commitment to building rather than destroying may ultimately pave the way for a more peaceful future.",-5.0,6.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,536.0,0.2857142857142857,0.011194029850746268
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have shed light on the U.S. intelligence community's awareness of the Islamic State's (ISIS) emergence as early as 2012. The documents, which include insights from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), suggest that the Obama Administration may have inadvertently fostered conditions that allowed ISIS to thrive, particularly by isolating the Syrian government led by Bashar al-Assad.

Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed has highlighted that the documents predict a troubling trajectory, indicating that support from Western nations, Turkey, and Gulf states for Takfiri militants would likely culminate in the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. This assertion raises questions about the strategic decisions made by the U.S. and its allies during the Syrian conflict.

Ahmed further contends that the West's sponsorship of violent Islamist groups was a deliberate strategy aimed at destabilizing Assad's regime, despite the clear risks associated with such actions. The documents reveal a stark contrast between the administration's public narrative and the intelligence assessments available at the time. Notably, President Obama famously referred to ISIS as a ""JV"" team, a characterization that many now view as a significant miscalculation in understanding the group's capabilities and ambitions.

Additionally, the documents provide critical insights into U.S. weapons operations in Libya prior to the 2012 Benghazi attack. They reveal that U.S. intelligence was aware of arms being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports, raising further concerns about the implications of American involvement in the region.

The report suggests that American servicemen and women may have been sacrificed due to a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that prioritized concealment over national security. This revelation has sparked renewed debate about the effectiveness and consequences of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly in relation to the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.

As the implications of these findings continue to unfold, they underscore the complexities and challenges of U.S. engagement in the region, prompting calls for a reevaluation of strategies that have far-reaching consequences for both national and global security.",-27.0,-2.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,389.0,-0.16666666666666666,-0.005141388174807198
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van after being removed from the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The incident has ignited a wave of speculation regarding her health and the authenticity of her public appearances.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, but observers noted a striking difference in her appearance. Many remarked that she looked noticeably lighter and more vibrant than before. However, the most significant change was her nose, which appeared to have undergone a transformation into a Roman-type shape, contrasting sharply with her previously recognized Nordic nose.

This alteration has led to rampant speculation among political commentators and the public alike. Some have suggested that the individual seen at Chelsea's apartment may not be the real Hillary Clinton but rather a stand-in or a double. This theory is bolstered by the observation that the stand-in appears younger and notably lacks a mole above the lip that has been a characteristic feature of Hillary for years.

As the election season heats up, questions are being raised about Clinton's ability to participate in upcoming debates, particularly with her rival, Donald Trump. The implications of her health and appearance have led to concerns about whether the real Hillary Clinton will be involved in her administration if elected. Observers are now advised to closely monitor any significant changes in her appearance during public events, as these could provide further clues about her condition and the authenticity of her public persona.

The speculation surrounding Clinton's health and appearance has drawn comparisons to previous controversies involving other political figures. Notably, some have recalled the theories that circulated during President Obama's tenure, which suggested a lack of transparency regarding his administration. This historical context adds a layer of intrigue to the current situation, as the public grapples with the implications of a potential double conducting all public appearances and decisions on behalf of a candidate.

The author of this article emphasizes that the views expressed are their own and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. Nonetheless, the discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and appearance is likely to continue as the election approaches, with many eager to uncover the truth behind the speculation. 

As the political landscape evolves, the focus on Clinton's well-being and the authenticity of her public engagements will remain a topic of interest. The implications of her health on her campaign and potential presidency could have far-reaching consequences, making it imperative for voters to stay informed and vigilant. 

In a time when transparency is more crucial than ever in politics, the questions surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and appearance serve as a reminder of the importance of accountability among public figures. As the nation prepares for the upcoming election, the public will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how these developments unfold and what they mean for the future of American leadership.",8.0,14.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,549.0,0.7,0.025500910746812388
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent rumors surrounding Hillary Clinton have sparked significant concern regarding her health, with speculation suggesting she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. A video that surfaced online shows Clinton appearing to lose control of her eye movements, raising alarms among her supporters and critics alike.

Shortly after the video was posted, Clinton canceled a scheduled fundraiser in North Carolina, further fueling speculation about her well-being. Research indicates that Clinton has only one rally planned between September 20 and October 19, with no speaking engagements listed for fundraisers during this period. This stark contrast is evident when compared to Donald Trump, who has four rallies scheduled between September 20 and 22, highlighting a potential disparity in campaign activity.

Concerns about Clinton's health have been amplified by reports of an incident where she required Secret Service assistance to navigate two steps. Observers are predicting that her health issues may become increasingly apparent, leading to what some are calling a potential meltdown. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly taking these concerns seriously, with discussions underway regarding potential replacements for Clinton as the party's nominee.

While Bernie Sanders has been mentioned as a possible alternative, he appears to be a less viable candidate, as he has shown little interest in running for president again. Despite the growing apprehension about Clinton's health, the DNC has continued to position her as the primary choice for the nomination, a decision that is becoming increasingly scrutinized.

As speculation mounts, many are questioning how Clinton's health issues might impact public perception of the Democratic Party. The situation remains fluid, with more developments expected in the coming days. Observers are keenly watching to see how the DNC will navigate this challenging landscape, especially as the party prepares for the upcoming election cycle.

In a political climate where health and public perception are critical, the implications of Clinton's current state could resonate far beyond her campaign. As the DNC grapples with these challenges, the future of the party's nomination process hangs in the balance, with many awaiting clarity on Clinton's health and the potential ramifications for the Democratic Party as a whole.",-8.0,4.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,410.0,0.26666666666666666,0.00975609756097561
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the quiet corridors of the White House, a restless Barack Obama found himself wandering late one night, grappling with the weight of his responsibilities and the challenges of leadership. The stillness of the historic residence was punctuated only by the soft creaking of the floorboards beneath his feet. As he meandered through the halls, he stumbled upon a small, seemingly innocuous Post-It note affixed to a wall. The single word scrawled across it—“ISIS”—would soon take on a life of its own, igniting a series of events that would change the course of history.

Months later, the vibrant atmosphere of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival enveloped him. The pulsating beats of music and the kaleidoscope of colors provided a stark contrast to the somber duties of the presidency. It was here, amidst the revelry and the carefree spirit of the festival, that the idea for ISIS began to crystallize in Obama’s mind. The carefree ambiance and the collective energy of the crowd sparked something deep within him, a long-buried childhood desire that had lain dormant for years.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the festival grounds, Obama made a decision that would shock the world. He resolved to start an international terrorist organization, a bold and audacious plan that seemed to materialize from the depths of his imagination. The notion was as surreal as it was ambitious, but in that moment, it felt like the only path forward.

In a moment of vulnerability, Obama confided in his close ally, Hillary Clinton. The two sat together, enjoying the simple pleasure of Popsicles on a warm day, the sweetness of the treat contrasting sharply with the gravity of their conversation. As they savored the icy treats, Obama revealed his secret ambitions, laying bare his unconventional aspirations. He spoke with fervor, claiming to be a 97-year-old Kenyan man sent to destroy America from within. The absurdity of his statement hung in the air, yet there was an undeniable sincerity in his voice.

Hillary listened intently, her expression a mix of disbelief and intrigue. The idea of Obama as a clandestine agent of chaos was difficult to digest, yet she found herself captivated by the audacity of his vision. As they continued their discussion, the concept of starting ISIS took shape, a plan that seemed both outrageous and strangely compelling.

“Maybe we should wait until I become president,” Hillary suggested, her mind racing with the implications of their conversation. The prospect of wielding power and influence while orchestrating such a grand scheme was tantalizing, and the two shared a moment of connection that transcended the ordinary.

Lying together in the serene beauty of the Rose Garden, surrounded by the fragrant blooms and the gentle rustle of leaves, they delved deeper into their plans. The tranquility of the setting provided a stark contrast to the gravity of their ambitions. They envisioned a world where their ideas could flourish, where they could reshape the narrative and challenge the status quo.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden hue over the garden, Obama and Hillary found themselves lost in a world of possibilities. The laughter of festival-goers and the distant sounds of music faded into the background as they plotted their course. In that moment, the seeds of a controversial legacy were sown, and the world would soon bear witness to the unfolding of their audacious plans.

The journey from a restless night in the White House to the creation of an international terrorist organization was fraught with complexities and contradictions. Obama’s whimsical musings, fueled by the carefree spirit of Coachella, had transformed into a serious discussion of power and influence. The unlikely duo of Obama and Clinton, bound by their shared ambitions, stood on the precipice of a new era, one that would challenge the very foundations of their nation.

As they lay in the Rose Garden, the weight of their aspirations hung heavy in the air. The world outside continued to turn, oblivious to the extraordinary conversation taking place within the walls of the White House. In that moment, they were not just political figures; they were visionaries, dreamers, and architects of a future that would be defined by their choices.

The night of revelations had set in motion a series of events that would reverberate through history. The Post-It note, the festival, the Popsicles, and the quiet moments in the Rose Garden all converged to create a narrative that was as improbable as it was compelling. As Obama and Hillary contemplated their next steps, the world watched with bated breath, unaware of the extraordinary journey that lay ahead.",-4.0,19.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,888.0,0.5277777777777778,0.021396396396396396
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the wake of recent attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his bold promise to ""destroy"" terrorism in America. Frank Wilkenmeyer, in a recent discussion, delves into the implications of such a statement, particularly in the context of Trump's personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton. While the intention behind Trump's rhetoric may be to reassure the American public, the potential consequences of his words raise significant concerns.

Trump's declaration to ""destroy all terrorists"" is not merely a call to action; it is a sweeping statement that could have far-reaching implications for civil rights, particularly for Muslim communities in the United States. The promise, while seemingly straightforward, raises alarms about the potential for profiling and discrimination against Muslims. Such profiling could lead to a culture of fear and mistrust, where individuals are judged not by their actions but by their religious beliefs.

The implications of Trump's rhetoric extend beyond mere profiling. Wilkenmeyer suggests that the former president's approach could pave the way for increased surveillance of Muslim communities. This heightened scrutiny could result in a chilling effect on civil liberties, as individuals may feel compelled to alter their behavior or hide their identities to avoid being targeted. The specter of segregation looms large, as communities may find themselves isolated and marginalized in the face of a government that views them with suspicion.

Moreover, the promise to ""destroy"" terrorism raises critical questions about due process, particularly for American citizens. The author warns that Trump's rhetoric could lead to a dangerous disregard for the legal rights of suspects. In a climate where fear and urgency dominate the narrative, the fundamental principles of justice may be compromised. The potential for wrongful accusations and the erosion of civil liberties are real threats that could emerge from a rush to judgment fueled by inflammatory language.

Wilkenmeyer draws parallels between Trump's rhetoric and historical abuses of power, suggesting that the former president's approach bears a resemblance to fascism. The invocation of fear as a political tool is not new; history is replete with examples of leaders who have exploited societal anxieties to consolidate power. By framing the fight against terrorism in such absolute terms, Trump risks normalizing a mindset that prioritizes security over individual rights, echoing the dark chapters of history where civil liberties were sacrificed in the name of national security.

The article concludes with a sobering assessment of Trump's promises. While the desire to combat terrorism is a legitimate concern, the methods proposed by the former president are deemed unrealistic and counterproductive. Rather than fostering a sense of safety and community, Trump's rhetoric serves to instill fear among the populace. The promise to ""destroy"" terrorism, devoid of a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved, may ultimately lead to more division and strife rather than the unity and security that it purports to offer.

In summary, Frank Wilkenmeyer's analysis of Trump's statements highlights the potential dangers of a simplistic approach to a multifaceted issue. The implications of his rhetoric extend far beyond the immediate context of terrorism, touching on fundamental questions of civil rights, due process, and the very fabric of American society. As the nation grapples with the realities of terrorism and its aftermath, it is crucial to approach the conversation with a commitment to justice, understanding, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background. The path forward must prioritize effective solutions that uphold the values of democracy rather than succumb to fear-driven narratives that threaten to undermine them.",-28.0,-30.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,683.0,-1.2,-0.043923865300146414
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.

In a stark warning, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has highlighted a precarious tipping point in global security, citing the escalating threats posed by terrorism and hostilities from nations such as the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno's remarks underscore a pressing concern regarding the current state of military readiness, which he argues is only sufficient to meet immediate operational needs. He cautions that any further reductions in military capacity could have dire consequences for national security.

Odierno pointed to a significant disconnect between military leadership and the current administration, attributing this gap to a longstanding disregard for the strategies and advice of military commanders during the Obama Administration. This disconnect, he asserts, has played a role in the emergence and expansion of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa, raising alarms about the effectiveness of U.S. military policy.

The Army has already seen a substantial reduction in its active force, with a decrease of 80,000 soldiers and the reorganization of its structure, which includes the elimination of 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. These cuts, according to Odierno, have not only diminished the Army's operational capabilities but have also led to a decline in morale and career progression for military personnel.

Moreover, Odierno criticized the administration for what he described as incompetence and arrogance, asserting that these factors have adversely affected the careers of military professionals. He emphasized that the United States is facing serious challenges from determined global adversaries that threaten both national and allied security.

In addition to personnel reductions, the Army's investment in modernization has seen a significant decline of 25%. This reduction has impacted critical programs, including the modernization of infantry fighting vehicles and the development of scout helicopters, further complicating the Army's ability to respond effectively to emerging threats.

As the global landscape continues to evolve, Odierno's warnings serve as a call to action for a reassessment of military strategies and priorities to ensure the safety and security of the nation.",-4.0,-15.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,384.0,-1.25,-0.0390625

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.

Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the November elections approach, the integrity of the electoral process has become a focal point of discussion across the United States. Every state has its own laws governing election methods and procedures, yet concerns have emerged regarding the potential for illegal activities that could undermine the democratic process. The National Democratic Party has faced accusations of attempting to manipulate elections through various means, raising alarms among citizens who value the principles of free and fair elections.

The author of this piece, identifying as a Christian and Constitutional Conservative, expresses a deep-seated belief that the Democratic Party is pursuing a path toward establishing a socialist dictatorship in the United States. This assertion is rooted in a series of allegations that have surfaced over the years, particularly surrounding the 2016 presidential election. Claims of voter fraud and ballot stuffing have been levied against the Democratic Party, with specific accusations that these tactics were employed to secure a victory for Hillary Clinton.

Central to the author's argument is the assertion that elections must be conducted in a manner that is free, fair, and honest. This includes the necessity of proper voter registration and the implementation of photo identification requirements for voters. The author contends that these measures are essential to ensure that only eligible individuals participate in the electoral process. However, it is claimed that the Democratic Party opposes voter ID laws, a stance that the author argues is designed to facilitate the voting of ineligible individuals.

The critique extends beyond the Democratic Party to encompass the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system. The author accuses these entities of suppressing fair election laws, which they believe contributes to an environment where election integrity is compromised. This perceived suppression has led to calls for citizens to take action in safeguarding the electoral process.

In light of these concerns, the author urges citizens to volunteer as monitors at polling places during the upcoming elections. This grassroots initiative is framed as a necessary step to prevent voter fraud and ensure that the electoral process remains transparent and accountable. The author emphasizes that the date of November 8, 2016, is critical, warning that it represents a pivotal moment in the fight to preserve the republic. The stakes are portrayed as high, with the potential for significant consequences should the integrity of the election be compromised.

Donald Trump is presented in a positive light throughout the article, with the author highlighting his patriotic mission to save the country. This portrayal aligns with the broader narrative that positions Trump as a defender of Constitutional Conservatism against what the author perceives as the encroaching threat of socialism represented by the Democratic Party.

The call to action is clear: citizens who value the principles of Constitutional Conservatism are urged to take an active role in monitoring elections. The author believes that by doing so, individuals can help ensure the integrity of the electoral process and protect the foundational values upon which the nation was built.

It is important to note that the views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. The discussion surrounding election integrity is a complex and multifaceted issue, and the perspectives shared here contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the future of democracy in the United States.

As the nation gears up for the elections, the emphasis on election integrity remains paramount. The call for vigilance and active participation in the electoral process resonates with many who are concerned about the potential for fraud and manipulation. Whether through volunteering at polling places or advocating for stricter voter ID laws, citizens are encouraged to engage in efforts that uphold the principles of democracy.

In conclusion, the upcoming elections represent not just a choice between candidates, but a critical juncture for the future of the republic. The author’s passionate plea for election integrity serves as a reminder of the importance of safeguarding the democratic process, ensuring that every vote counts and that the will of the people is truly reflected in the outcomes of elections. As November 8, 2016, approaches, the call for action is clear: it is time for citizens to stand up and protect the integrity of their elections.",-52.0,29.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,786.0,1.0,0.03689567430025445
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the annals of American political advertising, few images are as haunting and memorable as the 1964 political ad featuring a young girl picking daisies while a mushroom cloud looms ominously in the background. This ad, approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was a masterclass in emotional manipulation, designed to portray his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a reckless warmonger. Despite Johnson's own controversial policies in Vietnam, the ad effectively shifted public perception and solidified his position in the race.

As we navigate the current political landscape, one cannot help but wonder what a modern version of the ""Daisy"" ad might look like, particularly in the context of Hillary Clinton's campaign. The suggestion that such an ad could highlight Clinton's failures raises questions about the effectiveness of her messaging and the potential impact on her electoral prospects. In a climate where political narratives are crafted with precision, a well-executed ad could serve as a powerful tool to sway undecided voters.

Rumors have begun to circulate about a potential ""Daisy"" remake targeting Donald Trump, which could indicate a sense of desperation among Clinton's campaign staff. The idea of resurrecting such a potent symbol of fear and urgency suggests that her team recognizes the stakes of the upcoming election. However, the effectiveness of this strategy remains to be seen, especially given the complexities of modern media and voter sentiment.

Voters today are grappling with a media landscape that often presents biased coverage, particularly in relation to figures like Ted Cruz. Recent political shifts by Cruz have been met with scrutiny, yet the media's selective reporting has left many voters confused about the true nature of his positions. This inconsistency in coverage raises concerns about the integrity of journalism and its role in shaping public opinion.

The tendency of journalism to bury critical details is a troubling trend that reflects the short attention spans of the American public. In an age where soundbites reign supreme, the nuances of political discourse are often lost, leaving voters with an incomplete understanding of candidates and their policies. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the coverage of Cruz's past comments about Trump, which have been overshadowed by more sensational narratives.

Moreover, there is a growing perception of bias in media coverage against Democratic and liberal figures, contributing to the longstanding label of a ""liberal press."" This bias can skew public perception and create an uneven playing field for candidates like Clinton, who may find themselves at a disadvantage in a media environment that favors certain narratives over others.

As the upcoming debate approaches, the specter of past moderating mistakes looms large. The memory of Candy Crowley's handling of the 2012 presidential debate serves as a cautionary tale for moderators and candidates alike. The importance of fair and balanced questioning cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the way candidates are perceived by the electorate.

In addition to the challenges posed by media coverage, it is essential to consider the criticisms that Hillary Clinton has faced from within her own party. Notably, past remarks from Barack Obama and Michelle Obama regarding Clinton have often been overlooked in current discussions. These criticisms, which highlight her vulnerabilities, could be pivotal in shaping voter perceptions as the election draws nearer.

In light of these factors, the call for a new ""Daisy"" ad that documents Clinton's shortcomings becomes increasingly relevant. Such an ad could serve as a stark reminder of the stakes involved in the election, compelling voters to consider the implications of their choices. By focusing on Clinton's failures, the ad could resonate with an electorate that is hungry for authenticity and accountability.

Ultimately, the views expressed in this analysis reflect a broader concern about the state of political discourse in America. As candidates navigate the complexities of modern campaigning, the lessons of the past remain pertinent. The original ""Daisy"" ad was a powerful reminder of the consequences of political decisions, and a contemporary version could serve a similar purpose in today's polarized environment.

In conclusion, the potential for a modern ""Daisy"" ad targeting Hillary Clinton underscores the evolving nature of political messaging. As voters grapple with biased media coverage and the complexities of candidate narratives, the need for transparency and accountability has never been more critical. A new ad that highlights Clinton's shortcomings could not only impact her campaign but also serve as a catalyst for a more informed electorate. The stakes are high, and the power of political advertising remains a formidable force in shaping the future of American politics.",-18.0,12.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,865.0,0.36363636363636365,0.013872832369942197

If you question the veracity of a black president’s birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News.

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

In a heated political climate, Democrats have been accused of employing intimidation tactics in response to questions surrounding former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, has labeled these inquiries as racist. However, critics argue that this assertion is a non-sequitur, diverting attention from the substantive issues at hand.

The article presents several pieces of evidence that raise questions about the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate. Allegations have surfaced suggesting that the document may have been altered. Additionally, it has been noted that Obama’s social security number was issued in Connecticut, despite no records indicating he ever resided there. Compounding these concerns, the hospital cited on the birth certificate reportedly did not exist at the time the document was allegedly issued. Such discrepancies have led to speculation about possible falsification.

The article further challenges the existence of an original birth certificate, criticizing the reliance on accusations of racism rather than addressing the evidence presented. In the midst of this controversy, Donald Trump has weighed in, adding to the ongoing debate.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual, in May 2016.

In May 2016, a brutal homophobic attack on 26-year-old Aaron Woods has raised significant concerns about the safety of the LGBTQ+ community. Woods was approached by a man who unleashed a torrent of homophobic slurs before physically assaulting him, resulting in a broken jaw. The incident has not only left Woods with severe injuries but has also ignited discussions about the ongoing violence faced by individuals based on their sexual orientation.

Witnesses to the attack reported that the assailant shouted ""Muslim stuff"" during the confrontation, adding a troubling layer to the incident. This has led to a broader examination of the intersection between radical ideologies and the acceptance of the gay community. Woods' friend described him as a gentle person, emphasizing the senselessness of the violence inflicted upon him.

The attack on Woods is not an isolated incident. Around the same time, a similar assault occurred in Brighton, targeting a gay couple. These incidents have prompted local authorities to take action. Sgt. Peter Allan expressed his sadness over the rise in homophobic assaults, noting that while the victims are on the path to recovery, arrests have been made in connection with these violent acts.

The stark contrast between the acceptance of the gay community in many societies and the teachings of certain radical ideologies has come to the forefront. Islamic teachings traditionally condemn homosexuality, and under Shariah law, the punishment for such acts can be severe. This has highlighted a significant conflict between radical interpretations of Islam and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community.

As communities grapple with these issues, the need for dialogue and understanding becomes increasingly important. The attacks on Woods and others serve as a reminder of the work that still needs to be done to ensure safety and acceptance for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. The hope is that through awareness and education, society can move towards a more inclusive future, where such acts of violence are not tolerated and where every individual can live freely and authentically.",-26.0,-32.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,381.0,-1.8823529411764706,-0.08398950131233596
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).

Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On Saturday night, a shocking incident unfolded at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, when a man in a security uniform launched a violent attack on shoppers, leaving nine people injured. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" during the stabbing spree. Eyewitnesses recounted a scene of chaos as Adan moved through the mall, asking at least one victim if they were Muslim before attacking.

The St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly identified Adan as the perpetrator, leading to a wave of disbelief and concern among local residents. In the aftermath of the attack, ISIS claimed Adan as one of their own, further complicating the narrative surrounding the incident. This attack comes on the heels of other recent acts of terrorism in the United States, including a bomb explosion at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and a meat cleaver assault on police officers in New York City.

In the wake of the attack, members of the St. Cloud Somali community expressed their support for Adan's family, describing him as a good man and an accomplished student. This sentiment highlights the complexities of the situation, as many in the community grapple with the actions of one individual who has now cast a shadow over their collective identity.

The violence was brought to an end when Officer Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer, intervened and shot Adan, killing him on the scene. Mayor Dave Kleis praised Falconer as a hero for his swift action, which likely prevented further injuries and potential loss of life. The mayor's commendation reflects a broader sentiment of gratitude towards law enforcement in times of crisis.

The incident has reignited discussions about the Somali community in Minnesota, particularly in light of the nearly 10,000 Somali refugees who were relocated to the state during the Obama administration. While many Somali-Americans have integrated successfully into the community, there are growing concerns about the potential for radicalization among some individuals. Reports have indicated that Somali individuals in Minnesota have been targeted for recruitment by terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al-Shabab.

The article also references past convictions of Somali-Americans for collaborating with Islamist groups, raising alarms about the ongoing threat posed by radical elements within the community. Additionally, there have been documented threats made by Somali refugees in Minnesota, further fueling fears of extremism.

The situation in Somalia has also been a point of concern, as ISIS has been gaining strength in the region, reportedly receiving support from Yemen. This development has raised alarms about the potential for increased recruitment and radicalization of Somali-Americans in the United States. Notably, three Somali individuals in Minnesota were convicted of attempting to join ISIS, and there have been discussions about al-Shabab being approached by ISIS for potential collaboration.

The political implications of the St. Cloud attack are significant, with critics pointing to the immigration policies of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Detractors argue that her approach would lead to an increase in the number of Muslim refugees entering the United States, potentially heightening the risk of terror attacks. This sentiment has been echoed by supporters of Donald Trump, who have called for stricter immigration controls and a reevaluation of refugee resettlement policies.

As the nation grapples with the implications of the St. Cloud attack, the conversation surrounding immigration and national security continues to evolve. The incident has underscored the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges posed by radicalization and terrorism, particularly within immigrant communities.

In conclusion, the St. Cloud mall attack serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration, community identity, and national security. As the investigation continues and the community seeks to heal, the political ramifications of this incident will likely resonate far beyond Minnesota. The call for a reevaluation of immigration policies and a focus on ensuring safety from terrorism remains a pressing issue for many Americans as they head into the upcoming election cycle.",-72.0,-22.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,751.0,-0.6470588235294118,-0.02929427430093209
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

- The article criticizes the perception of victimhood in contemporary society.","**The Perception of Victimhood: A Case Study of Ahmad Khan Rahami**

In recent years, the millennial generation has often been characterized as the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" a label that reflects a broader societal trend towards declining standards for victimhood. This phenomenon is exemplified in the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the New Jersey and New York City bombings, who previously positioned himself as a victim of ""Islamophobia.""

Rahami, along with his father, took legal action against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department, alleging discrimination based on their Muslim faith. The lawsuit, filed in 2011, claimed that the Rahami family faced discrimination and ""selective enforcement"" concerning their chicken restaurant, First American. The family asserted that local residents subjected them to racial abuse, with statements such as ""Muslims don’t belong here"" highlighting the tensions they faced in their community.

The allegations made by the Rahami family painted a picture of a community rife with prejudice and a police force that failed to protect them from discrimination. However, Mayor Christian Bollwage firmly denied these claims, attributing the complaints against the Rahami family to issues related to noise and street congregation rather than any form of racial bias. This response underscores the complexities of the situation, where perceptions of victimhood can clash with the realities of community dynamics and law enforcement.

Despite their grievances, the Rahami family's lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful. This legal defeat did not deter Ahmad Khan Rahami from his subsequent actions, which culminated in the bombings that shocked both New Jersey and New York City. His case raises critical questions about the nature of victimhood in contemporary society and how individuals may exploit perceived injustices to justify their actions.

The narrative surrounding Rahami serves as a cautionary tale about the evolving standards of victimhood. In a world where grievances can be amplified and weaponized, the distinction between legitimate claims of discrimination and those that may be fabricated or exaggerated becomes increasingly blurred. This trend not only complicates the discourse around race and religion but also challenges the integrity of genuine victims who face real discrimination.

As society grapples with these issues, it is essential to critically examine the implications of labeling individuals as victims without a thorough understanding of their circumstances. The case of Ahmad Khan Rahami illustrates the potential dangers of a culture that prioritizes victimhood, where the line between victim and perpetrator can become obscured.

In conclusion, the Rahami case highlights the complexities of victimhood in modern society, raising important questions about accountability, community relations, and the consequences of perceived injustices. As discussions around these topics continue, it is crucial to foster a more nuanced understanding of victimhood that recognizes both the realities of discrimination and the potential for manipulation within the narrative.",-38.0,-36.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,518.0,-2.0,-0.0694980694980695
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to move businesses if employees don't vote in their favor.

In a landscape where corporate influence looms large over the electoral process, the tactics employed by employers to sway employee voting behavior have come under scrutiny. Historically, employers have threatened to relocate their businesses if employees do not cast their votes in favor of their interests. This practice raises significant ethical questions, particularly when the consequences of such voting often lead to negative outcomes for workers, including job outsourcing and stagnant wages.

The recent political climate has seen a resurgence of these tactics, with notable figures in the corporate world making headlines for their threats. One such figure is Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, who has made waves by warning of economic repercussions should a Democrat win the upcoming election. Puzder's statements echo a long-standing trend where corporate leaders leverage their economic power to influence the political choices of their employees.

Puzder has been vocal about his plans to fully automate his restaurants if a Democrat is elected, citing rising labor costs as a primary concern. This move towards automation is not merely a business strategy; it represents a significant shift in the employment landscape, where human workers may be replaced by machines. Puzder's vision includes an automated restaurant model akin to Eatsa, where customers place orders through kiosks, eliminating the need for staff interaction. This model raises questions about the future of employment in the fast-food industry and the broader implications for workers across various sectors.

Critics of Puzder's stance argue that his opposition to progressive policies aimed at raising the minimum wage is misguided. He contends that such policies lead to job losses, a claim that has been challenged by numerous studies suggesting that raising the minimum wage can have positive effects on the economy and worker well-being. Puzder's position, however, appears to be aimed at influencing not only his employees but also other minimum wage workers to vote against their own interests.

With approximately 20,000 employees under his leadership, Puzder's influence is significant. His public statements and blog, which discusses politics and capitalism, raise important questions about the views of his employees regarding capitalism and their own economic futures. The disparity between Puzder's reported earnings—nearly $4.5 million in 2012—and the stagnant wages of his employees highlights a growing divide in the corporate world, where profits continue to rise while workers struggle to make ends meet.

The tactics employed by Puzder and others in similar positions reflect a broader trend in corporate America, where the threat of economic harm is used as a tool to manipulate the political landscape. This approach not only undermines the democratic process but also places undue pressure on employees who may feel compelled to vote in a manner that aligns with their employer's interests rather than their own.

As the election approaches, the implications of these corporate threats become increasingly pronounced. Regardless of the outcome, Puzder's commitment to automation suggests a future where profits are prioritized over people. This shift raises critical questions about the role of corporations in shaping the political landscape and the responsibilities they hold towards their employees.

In conclusion, the intersection of corporate influence and employee voting behavior presents a complex challenge for workers navigating their rights and interests in the face of economic pressure. As leaders like Andy Puzder continue to make headlines with their threats, it becomes imperative for employees to critically assess the implications of their voting choices and the potential consequences for their livelihoods. The ongoing dialogue surrounding these issues will undoubtedly shape the future of work and the relationship between employers and employees in the years to come.",21.0,2.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,675.0,0.08333333333333333,0.002962962962962963
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a significant development in the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, the FBI has announced that it is examining new evidence that could have serious implications for the former Secretary of State and her close aide, Huma Abedin. This new evidence emerged during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Abedin, and has raised questions about the integrity of the previous investigations into Clinton's email practices.

The investigation into Weiner, who has faced legal troubles of his own, led to the discovery of a laptop that he shared with Abedin. This laptop is believed to contain ""tens of thousands of emails"" from Abedin, including emails that were forwarded from Clinton's account. Notably, these emails were not submitted to the FBI during its earlier inquiries, which raises the possibility that they could be work-related or classified. If this is the case, it could indicate that both Clinton and Abedin may have misled the FBI, a situation that could lead to prosecutable offenses.

The timing of the FBI's announcement is particularly striking, as it came just 11 days before the presidential election, underscoring the seriousness of the findings. This revelation has reignited public interest and scrutiny regarding Clinton's email practices, which had been a contentious issue throughout the 2016 election cycle.

On July 5, 2016, FBI Director James Comey publicly detailed the evidence against Clinton but ultimately did not recommend charges. This decision was met with discontent among some FBI officials, who felt that the investigation had not been adequately pursued. A high-ranking FBI official later stated that there was a consensus within the bureau that Clinton should have her security clearance revoked and that she should face prosecution for her actions.

Further complicating the narrative, an FBI summary revealed that a State Department official allegedly pressured the FBI to declassify certain information in exchange for additional agents at diplomatic posts. Both the FBI and the State Department have denied these claims, but the implications of such actions raise questions about the integrity of the investigation process.

Additionally, the summary mentioned a group of State Department officials referred to as ""The Shadow Government,"" who were reportedly involved in discussions regarding Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests related to Clinton's emails. This group’s activities have led to concerns about transparency and accountability within the government.

Clinton's handling of her email server has also been criticized for endangering national security. Reports indicate that she ignored security advice during her campaign, opting instead for a photo opportunity that could have compromised her safety and that of others. This decision has drawn ire from various quarters, further complicating her public image.

In a troubling twist, it has been revealed that a Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official involved in the investigation. This revelation has raised eyebrows and led to questions about potential conflicts of interest within the FBI as it pertains to the investigation of Clinton.

The investigation has also spotlighted Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was identified as having deleted over 33,000 emails from Clinton's server. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department, a decision that has been scrutinized given the volume of emails deleted and the implications of such actions.

Leaked emails have further complicated Clinton's narrative, suggesting that she communicated with President Obama via her private server. This contradicts previous claims made by Clinton that the President was unaware of her use of a private email system. The existence of these communications raises questions about the extent of knowledge and involvement of high-ranking officials in the use of the private server.

Moreover, further emails indicate that Clinton deleted emails herself without any oversight, which raises significant questions about her intent and the legality of her actions. While Comey did not press charges against Clinton due to a perceived lack of intent, the emergence of new evidence suggests that this assessment may need to be reevaluated.

The timeline of events surrounding the investigation and the deletion of emails is critical in understanding the potential collusion and cover-up efforts that may have taken place. Key dates related to the investigation highlight the complexity of the situation and the various players involved.

As the FBI continues to investigate this new evidence, the implications for Clinton, Abedin, and the broader political landscape remain to be seen. The findings could have far-reaching consequences, not only for those directly involved but also for the public's trust in government institutions and the electoral process.

In conclusion, the renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices, spurred by new evidence linked to Anthony Weiner, has reignited a contentious debate over accountability and transparency in government.

Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In a significant shift in tone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has publicly acknowledged the challenges stemming from her open borders policy for Syrian refugees, which has been a cornerstone of her administration. This policy, aimed at providing sanctuary to those fleeing conflict, has led to a notable increase in crime rates, including thousands of reported sexual assaults and violent crimes in various German cities.

The backlash from the German public has been palpable, culminating in a substantial defeat for Merkel's conservative Democrat party in recent elections. The electoral results reflect a growing discontent among citizens regarding the handling of the migrant crisis, prompting Merkel to express regret over the situation. She stated that the issues could have been avoided, highlighting a shift in her previously unwavering stance on multiculturalism, which she now describes as a “living lie.”

During her party's annual conference, Merkel reiterated her previous slogan, “we can do this,” while acknowledging the potential for continued high levels of migration to overwhelm Germany. This admission marks a significant departure from her earlier rhetoric, as she now emphasizes the necessity of regaining control over the influx of migrants.

In response to the mounting concerns, Merkel announced plans to reduce the number of refugees entering Germany. However, she stopped short of committing to a specific limit on arrivals, indicating a cautious approach to the complex issue. Instead, she outlined a multi-level strategy aimed at regulating and limiting migration, focusing on initiatives at the German, European, and global levels.

The implications of Merkel's policies extend beyond Germany, with warnings that similar challenges could arise in America. As the debate over immigration continues to intensify, the experiences of Germany under Merkel's leadership serve as a cautionary tale for other nations grappling with the complexities of refugee resettlement and integration.

As Merkel navigates this turbulent political landscape, her acknowledgment of the difficulties associated with her refugee policy may signal a turning point in her administration's approach to migration, reflecting a broader shift in public sentiment and the urgent need for effective solutions.",-2.0,-16.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,396.0,-1.3333333333333333,-0.04040404040404041

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.",http://freedomdaily.com/disgusting-because-of-hillary-obama-ny-terrorist-will-get-better-treatment-than-us-vets/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3895D4C900000578-3798726-Ahmad_Khan_Rahami_28_was_taken_into_custody_on_Monday_after_a_sh-a-65_1474398076306.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a striking revelation, a terrorist responsible for planting explosives in New Jersey and New York City is set to receive superior medical care compared to U.S. veterans. This situation has sparked outrage and frustration, particularly in light of a long-standing scandal involving the Veteran’s Administration (VA) that dates back to 2014. The scandal, which involved long waiting lists and cover-ups of inefficiency, has left many questioning the government's commitment to those who have served the nation.

During a recent campaign speech, former President Donald Trump highlighted this troubling disparity in care. He pointed out that the terrorist, Ahmad Rahami, will have access to top doctors, modern hospital facilities, and legal representation, while countless veterans struggle to receive the care they desperately need. Trump's comments have resonated with many who feel that the system has failed those who have sacrificed for their country.

The contrast between the treatment of Rahami and the plight of veterans is stark. Reports indicate that over 300,000 veterans have died while waiting for VA care, a statistic that underscores the severity of the issue. Furthermore, the mental health crisis among veterans has reached alarming levels, with many taking their own lives while waiting for assistance, including tragic incidents occurring in VA parking lots.

The frustration expressed by the author of this article reflects a growing sentiment among the public regarding the government's failure to prioritize the health and well-being of veterans. As the nation grapples with the implications of this disparity, the question remains: how can a system that provides better care for a convicted terrorist fail to adequately support those who have defended the country?

The situation raises critical concerns about the allocation of resources and the effectiveness of the VA. Many veterans feel abandoned by a system that was designed to support them, while a terrorist receives the best possible medical treatment. This juxtaposition has ignited a debate about the values and priorities of the nation, prompting calls for reform and a reevaluation of how veterans are treated.

As the story unfolds, it is clear that the issue of veteran care is far from resolved. The public's outcry for change is growing louder, and the hope is that it will lead to meaningful improvements in the system. The treatment of veterans should reflect the sacrifices they have made, and the current disparity in care is a stark reminder of the work that still needs to be done.",13.0,-3.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,467.0,-0.17647058823529413,-0.006423982869379015

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a dramatic incident that unfolded in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, intervened to stop an ISIS terrorist who had stabbed eight people. Falconer’s swift action not only saved lives but also highlighted the importance of responsible gun ownership and self-defense training. However, his business, Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., which focuses on gun safety and Second Amendment rights, faces potential threats from political figures, notably Hillary Clinton.

Falconer’s business is dedicated to providing training for law-abiding citizens who wish to carry concealed firearms for self-defense. This training is crucial in empowering individuals to protect themselves and their loved ones in dangerous situations. However, Clinton’s stance on firearms and gun training has raised concerns among those who advocate for Second Amendment rights. If elected president, Clinton has expressed intentions that could jeopardize Falconer’s livelihood and the broader gun training industry.

Central to Clinton's agenda is her opposition to the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which currently protects businesses like Falconer's from frivolous lawsuits. The PLCAA was enacted to ensure that gun manufacturers and dealers are not held liable for the criminal misuse of firearms by third parties. Clinton’s desire to eliminate this act would expose Falconer’s business to a wave of legal challenges, potentially crippling his ability to operate.

Critics have pointed out that Clinton has been accused of misrepresenting the protections offered by the PLCAA, claiming that it provides immunity to gunmakers and dealers. In reality, the act does not shield these entities from all legal accountability; rather, it prevents them from being unjustly targeted for the actions of individuals who misuse firearms. Falconer, who has dedicated his life to protecting citizens through law enforcement and firearms training, stands at the forefront of this debate, embodying the values of self-defense and responsible gun ownership.

The implications of Clinton's policies extend beyond Falconer’s business. They represent a broader threat to the rights of individuals who promote self-defense and gun ownership. Advocates for gun rights argue that such policies undermine the ability of citizens to protect themselves, especially in light of incidents like the one Falconer faced in St. Cloud. The ability to carry a concealed firearm can be a critical factor in ensuring personal safety, and training programs like those offered by Falconer are essential in preparing individuals for such responsibilities.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the stakes for firearms instructors and gun rights advocates remain high. Falconer’s experience as both a police officer and a firearms instructor positions him as a key figure in the ongoing discussion about self-defense and the rights of citizens to bear arms. His commitment to educating others about gun safety and responsible ownership is a testament to the importance of such training in today’s society.

In conclusion, the potential impact of Hillary Clinton’s policies on businesses like Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. raises significant concerns for those who value the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense. As the debate over gun control intensifies, the future of firearms training and the rights of individuals to protect themselves hang in the balance. Falconer’s story serves as a reminder of the critical role that responsible gun ownership plays in ensuring public safety and the ongoing fight to preserve these rights in the face of political opposition.",-11.0,16.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,649.0,0.64,0.02465331278890601
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election season heats up, the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has emerged as a significant topic of discussion among voters and political analysts alike. Recent polling data reveals a troubling trend regarding public perception of Clinton's health, with a notable increase in the number of registered voters expressing concerns about her well-being.

A recent poll indicates that over 40% of registered voters now believe Clinton is in ""below average"" or ""very poor"" health, a sharp rise from just 26% in late August. This shift in perception highlights a growing unease among the electorate as they consider the implications of her health on her candidacy. In contrast, the percentage of voters who view Clinton's health as ""average"" has remained stagnant at 28%, suggesting that the negative sentiment is gaining traction while the neutral perspective remains unchanged.

The scrutiny of Clinton's health is not occurring in a vacuum. In a parallel development, the perception of her opponent, Donald Trump, has seen a slight uptick in confidence regarding his health. The percentage of voters who believe Trump is in ""above average"" or ""excellent"" health has increased from 33% to 36%. This contrast in public perception may play a crucial role in shaping voter sentiment as the election approaches.

A significant factor contributing to the heightened concern about Clinton's health is the widespread awareness of her potential medical issues. Nearly 80% of respondents in the poll reported being aware of these concerns, indicating that the topic is not only prevalent in political discourse but also resonates with a large segment of the voting population. Clinton, who is 68 years old, is often perceived as looking older than her age, which further fuels speculation about her health status.

Speculation surrounding Clinton's health has been exacerbated by various reports and observations. Notably, there have been claims that she has been prescribed Coumadin, a medication commonly used to prevent blood clots, and that she has researched Provigil, a drug typically used to treat serious conditions such as narcolepsy. These revelations have raised eyebrows and intensified scrutiny regarding her fitness for office.

Public observations of Clinton have also contributed to the growing concerns. Many voters have noted instances where she appeared confused, required naps, or exhibited physical difficulties, such as needing assistance to navigate stairs. These moments have not gone unnoticed and have led to increased speculation about her overall health and stamina.

The impact of these health-related concerns is further amplified by the presence of videos and images documenting Clinton's health issues, including a widely publicized fainting incident at the 9/11 Memorial. Reports suggest that these videos are being removed from the internet, raising questions about transparency and the campaign's efforts to manage public perception. Critics argue that such actions may be an attempt to limit the visibility of her health struggles, thereby shielding her candidacy from further scrutiny.

Moreover, Clinton's frequent coughing during speeches has drawn significant public attention and concern. This persistent issue has not only become a talking point among voters but has also led to speculation about her overall health and ability to endure the rigors of a presidential campaign. The combination of these factors has created a narrative that may prove challenging for Clinton as she seeks to reassure voters of her capability to serve as president.

As the election draws nearer, the implications of these health concerns could be profound. Voter confidence in a candidate's health is often intertwined with perceptions of their ability to lead effectively. With Clinton facing increasing scrutiny and skepticism regarding her health, her campaign may need to address these issues head-on to mitigate potential fallout.

In conclusion, the growing concerns about Hillary Clinton's health are shaping the narrative of the upcoming presidential election. With a significant portion of the electorate expressing doubts about her well-being, the former Secretary of State faces a critical challenge in reassuring voters of her fitness for office. As the campaign progresses, it remains to be seen how these health-related issues will impact her candidacy and the overall dynamics of the election.",-11.0,21.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,777.0,0.7,0.02702702702702703

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle, a former high school sweetheart of Bill Clinton, has unveiled a controversial tell-all book titled ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which aims to shed light on the alleged truths surrounding the lives of Bill and Hillary Clinton. The book presents a series of claims that paint a troubling picture of Hillary Clinton's character and behavior, particularly towards those she perceives as beneath her.

In her narrative, Kyle alleges that Hillary has a history of mistreating individuals in subordinate positions and actively obstructing the paths of others seeking power. Drawing from her personal experiences, Kyle recounts moments from her past with Bill Clinton, including instances where Hillary reportedly made derogatory remarks. One particularly striking incident occurred during an Easter egg hunt for developmentally challenged children, where Hillary is said to have expressed frustration using offensive language.

Kyle's portrayal of Hillary extends to her views on Arkansas residents, whom she allegedly regarded as ""ignorant hillbillies."" This perspective is contrasted with Hillary's self-image, which she cultivated from her middle-class upbringing in Illinois. The book suggests that this sense of superiority influenced Hillary's interactions with the people of Arkansas, further complicating her public persona.

The narrative also touches on the Clintons' evolving relationship with Arkansas. According to Kyle, the couple grew weary of their time in the state, which ultimately led Bill Clinton to forgo a reelection bid in 1990 as he set his sights on a presidential run. 

""Hillary: The Other Woman"" promises to be a provocative addition to the ongoing discourse surrounding the Clintons, offering readers a glimpse into the dynamics of their personal and political lives through the eyes of someone who once shared a close connection with Bill Clinton. As the book gains attention, it is likely to reignite discussions about the former first couple's legacy and the complexities of their relationship.",-10.0,-11.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,358.0,-0.9166666666666666,-0.030726256983240222

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking yet contentious ruling, a Massachusetts judge has enacted a special law that allows black males to flee from police without facing legal consequences. This law is now in effect and cannot be appealed, raising significant concerns about public safety across the state.

The judge's decision stems from the acknowledgment of a pervasive fear among some black Americans regarding police officers. This fear, the ruling suggests, often leads to a tendency to flee when approached by law enforcement. While the intention behind the law may be to address these fears, many are skeptical about its effectiveness as a remedy for the underlying issues it seeks to address.

Critics argue that the ruling could exacerbate tensions between law enforcement and the communities they serve. By allowing individuals who feel ""disproportionately"" targeted to run from police without facing repercussions, the law effectively removes a critical tool that officers previously relied upon. Under the former legal framework, fleeing from police could be interpreted as ""reasonable suspicion,"" providing officers with the grounds to detain individuals for further questioning. With this new law in place, that basis for detainment has been eliminated, potentially hindering police efforts to maintain public safety.

The article highlights the unique dangers that police officers face in their line of work, a reality that may not be fully understood by civilians. Law enforcement personnel often encounter unpredictable and volatile situations, and the ability to pursue individuals who flee can be crucial in preventing crime and ensuring community safety. The ruling, critics argue, undermines the police's ability to protect and serve effectively, creating an environment where fleeing from law enforcement is not only permissible but encouraged.

Adding a touch of humor to the serious discussion, the article notes that law-abiding citizens are typically the ones who do not run from police. This observation underscores the irony of the situation: while the law aims to address the fears of a specific demographic, it inadvertently sends a message that fleeing from law enforcement is an acceptable response, potentially complicating the relationship between police and the communities they serve.

As the implications of this ruling unfold, the Massachusetts community is left grappling with the balance between addressing legitimate fears and ensuring public safety. The law's long-term effects on both law enforcement practices and community relations remain to be seen, but the initial reactions suggest a deep divide in opinions on how best to navigate the complex issues surrounding race, policing, and public safety in America today.",-13.0,-2.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,477.0,-0.125,-0.0041928721174004195
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

In his remarks, Sansaricq criticized the response to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, asserting that corruption overshadowed the essential aid that was needed. He claimed that despite billions of dollars flowing into the Clinton Foundation, the Haitian people continue to suffer, alleging that the Clintons exploited the disaster for personal gain and stole billions from the nation.

Sansaricq highlighted the stark contrast between the wealth accumulated by the Clintons and the ongoing plight of many Haitians, who he noted still live in tents years after the disaster. He called for greater transparency regarding the funds raised and questioned the reasons behind the failure to deliver adequate aid to those in need.

Referencing Peter Schweizer’s book ""Clinton Cash,"" which examines the financial dealings of the Clintons, Sansaricq expressed his concerns about the integrity of the foundation.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed that she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance to revisit the past. This statement comes in the wake of the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) disappointing performance in recent elections in Berlin, which has highlighted a growing wave of anti-migrant sentiment across Germany.

Merkel's comments signal a potential shift in her approach to refugee policy, as she acknowledged her unpreparedness for the 2015 refugee crisis, a pivotal moment that saw a significant influx of migrants into Germany. Taking responsibility for the CDU's poor election results, she recognized that the political landscape has changed, with increasing support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has capitalized on public concerns regarding migration.

Despite her regrets about the past, Merkel has firmly dismissed the notion of implementing substantial changes to her existing policy framework. She rejected calls from the Christian Social Union (CSU) for a cap on the number of migrants allowed into the country, as well as proposals to prioritize Christian migrants over their Muslim counterparts. Merkel emphasized that such discrimination against Muslim asylum-seekers would contradict the fundamental principles of her party and the core values of Germany.

The political climate surrounding migration has become increasingly fraught, with the anti-migrant atmosphere often linked to fears of terrorism and crime associated with incoming refugees. This has created a challenging environment for Merkel, who has long championed a humanitarian approach to migration. The rise of the AfD, which has gained traction by advocating for stricter immigration controls, reflects a significant shift in public sentiment that could pose challenges for Merkel in the upcoming federal elections.

The leader of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, has threatened to withdraw support for Merkel over her handling of migrant issues, further complicating her position within the coalition government. As the political landscape evolves, Merkel's ability to navigate these tensions will be crucial in maintaining her leadership and the stability of her party.

As Germany grapples with the implications of its refugee policy, Merkel's reflections on her past decisions underscore the complexities of governance in a rapidly changing political environment. While she remains committed to her principles, the pressure from within her coalition and the electorate may force her to reconsider her stance as the nation approaches a critical electoral period.

In summary, Merkel's recent statements reveal a leader at a crossroads, grappling with the consequences of her past decisions while facing mounting pressure from both her party and the public. The future of Germany's refugee policy hangs in the balance as the nation prepares for what could be a pivotal election, with the potential for significant implications for both Merkel's legacy and the direction of the country's immigration strategy.",-14.0,-5.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,524.0,-0.3125,-0.009541984732824428
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

Sundsvall, Sweden – A Somali asylum seeker, identified as Abdullah, has been arrested following a brutal assault on his pregnant wife, raising concerns about domestic violence and the treatment of women within immigrant communities. Abdullah, who has a documented history of violent crimes and is known to local police, has been living off welfare benefits since his arrival in Sweden five years ago.

The incident occurred after Abdullah returned home from a night out with friends. Reports indicate that he demanded his wife’s niece, whom she was babysitting, leave the house before his return. Upon discovering that the niece was still present, Abdullah reacted violently. Witnesses reported that he physically attacked his wife, kicking her in the head and stomach, leaving her in a state of distress and fear.

In a further act of humiliation, Abdullah poured beer over his wife and urinated on her, actions that have sparked outrage within the community. This incident not only highlights the severity of domestic violence but also raises questions about the treatment of women in certain cultural contexts.

The case has drawn attention to the interpretation of religious texts, particularly Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. Critics have pointed out that Abdullah's actions reflect a selective adherence to Islamic teachings. While he invokes religious justification for his behavior, his consumption of alcohol and abandonment of his wife contradict the very principles he claims to uphold.

The incident has ignited a broader conversation about the responsibilities of asylum seekers and the importance of integrating into Swedish society. Abdullah's reliance on welfare benefits, coupled with his history of violence, has led to calls for stricter measures to address domestic violence and support for victims.

Local authorities have expressed their commitment to addressing such issues, emphasizing the need for community support systems to protect vulnerable individuals. The case serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by many women in abusive relationships, particularly within immigrant populations where cultural norms may complicate the situation.

As the investigation continues, community leaders are urging for increased awareness and education on domestic violence, as well as the importance of respecting women's rights. The hope is that this incident will lead to a greater understanding of the complexities surrounding domestic abuse and the need for comprehensive support for victims.

Abdullah's actions have not only affected his wife but have also cast a shadow over the Somali community in Sundsvall. Many are calling for a collective response to ensure that such violence is condemned and that support systems are in place for those in need.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the community watches closely, hoping for justice for the victim and a renewed commitment to preventing domestic violence in all its forms. The case underscores the urgent need for dialogue and action to protect the rights and dignity of women, regardless of their background or circumstances.",-28.0,-44.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,545.0,-2.0952380952380953,-0.08073394495412844
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, Pennsylvania Republicans are advocating for House Bill 29, legislation that would permit voter intimidation on Election Day. First introduced in June, the bill aims to empower non-residents to monitor polling places and challenge voters, raising alarms about potential disruptions to the voting process.

Critics of the bill, including Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice, have voiced strong concerns regarding its implications. Gitlin warns that the legislation could lead to discriminatory challenges against voters, particularly targeting marginalized communities. The potential for longer wait times at polling places is another significant worry, as the presence of non-resident monitors could create an atmosphere of intimidation that discourages individuals from exercising their right to vote.

The bill's proponents argue that it is necessary to ensure election integrity, but the timing and context of its introduction have raised eyebrows. Former President Donald Trump has been vocal in encouraging his supporters to monitor polling areas, alleging that voter fraud could jeopardize his chances of winning in Pennsylvania. This rhetoric has fueled fears that the bill could be used as a tool for intimidation, particularly against voters from minority groups who may already face barriers to participation.

Adding to the urgency surrounding House Bill 29, an amendment has been proposed that would allow the legislation to take effect immediately upon passage, rather than waiting the customary 60 days. This expedited timeline could mean that the bill could be in effect for the upcoming elections, further intensifying concerns about its potential impact on voter turnout.

The stakes are particularly high in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that is crucial for Trump's electoral strategy. With the race expected to be close, the introduction of voter intimidation tactics could significantly influence the outcome. Observers fear that if House Bill 29 is successful, it could set a precedent for similar measures in other states, as Republicans look to replicate these tactics in their own electoral contests.

The implications of this bill extend beyond Pennsylvania, as it could embolden other states to adopt similar legislation aimed at monitoring and challenging voters. The potential for widespread voter intimidation raises fundamental questions about the integrity of the electoral process and the rights of citizens to participate without fear of harassment.

As the debate over House Bill 29 continues, advocates for voting rights are mobilizing to oppose the legislation, emphasizing the importance of protecting the democratic process. The outcome of this legislative push could have lasting effects on voter participation and the overall health of democracy in Pennsylvania and beyond.

In a climate where voter suppression tactics are increasingly scrutinized, the push for House Bill 29 serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battles over voting rights in the United States. As Election Day approaches, the eyes of the nation will be on Pennsylvania, where the implications of this bill could reverberate far beyond its borders. The fight for fair and accessible elections remains a critical issue, and the outcome of this legislation could shape the future of voting rights in America.",-19.0,-7.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,566.0,-0.35,-0.012367491166077738

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an American Olympian fencer, made history as the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab. Her groundbreaking achievement has not only inspired many but also brought attention to the challenges faced by Muslim Americans. Recently, Muhammad shared her feelings of unsafety in the United States, recounting a troubling incident where she was followed home from practice. This experience has prompted her to speak out about the severity of racist incidents that continue to plague society.

In her reflections, Muhammad referenced the tragic shooting in North Carolina and the negative rhetoric surrounding the Khan family, highlighting the pervasive nature of racism and discrimination. These incidents underscore the ongoing struggles faced by individuals in minority communities, particularly in the context of rising hate crimes.

While some may argue that America is an ""Islamophobic"" country, the article presents a counterpoint, noting that hate crime rates against Jews are statistically higher than those against Muslims. This observation raises important questions about the broader landscape of discrimination and the complexities of identity in America.

Despite her concerns, the article poses a thought-provoking question: why does Muhammad choose to remain in the United States if she perceives it as so terrible? It suggests that conditions in many Muslim-majority countries may be worse, prompting a reflection on the freedoms and safety that America offers. The contrast between the challenges faced in the U.S. and the potential dangers in other parts of the world serves as a reminder of the privileges that come with living in a democratic society.

As Muhammad continues to advocate for change and raise awareness about the issues affecting her community, her story serves as a powerful testament to resilience and the ongoing fight against discrimination. Her journey not only highlights the importance of representation in sports but also emphasizes the need for dialogue and understanding in a diverse society.",-23.0,-23.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,353.0,-1.7692307692307692,-0.06515580736543909
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In recent days, the city of Charlotte has witnessed a troubling escalation of protests that have devolved into riots, following a shooting incident involving a black police officer and a black suspect. What began as a demonstration has transformed into a scene of chaos, raising questions about the motivations and actions of those involved.

The protests, which were initially framed as a response to systemic issues within law enforcement, have taken a dark turn. Many participants have been labeled as ""thugs,"" engaging in behavior that not only disrupts the peace but also undermines the very message they claim to support. The actions of these individuals have sparked outrage among community members who believe that the protests have strayed far from their intended purpose.

One particularly disturbing incident highlighted the troubling nature of the protests. Rioters were seen mocking an injured police officer, a moment that encapsulates the growing divide between law enforcement and certain factions of the protest movement. Instead of offering assistance or showing empathy, these individuals chose to revel in the officer's misfortune, demonstrating a lack of respect for those who put their lives on the line to protect the community.

Critics of the protests argue that many participants do not fully grasp the complexities of the issues they are rallying against. The author of this article expresses disdain for the protesters' actions, suggesting that their behavior reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the very reasons for their demonstrations. This lack of awareness raises concerns about the effectiveness of their message and the potential for genuine dialogue to address the underlying issues.

Moreover, the article takes a critical stance towards the Black Lives Matter movement and its supporters. Derogatory generalizations about their character and behavior paint a bleak picture of the movement, suggesting that it has become synonymous with chaos and disorder rather than constructive change. This perspective posits that the actions of a few reflect poorly on the broader black community, further complicating the conversation around race and justice in America.

The author’s strong negative opinion towards the Black Lives Matter movement is evident throughout the piece. Rather than fostering understanding and unity, the actions of some protesters have contributed to a narrative that alienates potential allies and detracts from the important conversations that need to take place. The focus on rioting and violence overshadows the legitimate grievances that many individuals within the community may have, ultimately hindering progress.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to unfold, it is crucial to reflect on the implications of these protests. The actions of a small group can have far-reaching consequences, not only for the individuals involved but also for the community as a whole. The potential for meaningful change is diminished when protests devolve into riots, and the message becomes lost amidst the chaos.

In conclusion, the recent protests in Charlotte have raised significant concerns about the direction of the movement and the actions of those involved. While the desire for justice and reform is valid, the means by which it is pursued must be carefully considered. The community deserves better than the chaos that has erupted in the wake of this incident, and it is imperative that all voices are heard in a manner that promotes understanding and progress, rather than division and strife.",-83.0,-48.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,610.0,-2.0869565217391304,-0.07868852459016394
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In his final address at the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama reinforced his vision of a far-left, progressive liberal agenda, which has drawn significant criticism from various quarters. Characterized by some as a borderline socialist, Obama has faced backlash for his policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and an increasing acceptance of refugees into the United States.

During his speech, Obama advocated for a one world order and emphasized the importance of international governance. He suggested that, in the pursuit of global security, the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms. However, he was clear in stating that the right to self-defense is the only freedom that should remain untouchable.

Despite acknowledging the criticism he has received from Americans regarding his views, Obama stood firm in his beliefs, demonstrating a resolute commitment to his progressive ideals. This steadfastness has sparked frustration among critics who perceive his approach as arrogant and unwilling to compromise. The divisiveness in Washington D.C. has only intensified, raising questions about the expectations for cooperation among representatives in a polarized political landscape.

As Obama prepares to leave office, his final address serves as a reminder of the contentious debates surrounding his administration's policies. The call for a more interconnected world, while appealing to some, has left many Americans feeling uneasy about the implications for national sovereignty and individual freedoms. The challenge remains for future leaders to navigate these complex issues while fostering unity in a divided nation. 

In the wake of Obama's tenure, the discourse surrounding his legacy will likely continue to evoke strong opinions, reflecting the broader ideological battles that define contemporary American politics. As the nation looks ahead, the question of how to balance global cooperation with domestic priorities remains a critical concern for both policymakers and citizens alike.",13.0,9.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,352.0,0.6923076923076923,0.02556818181818182
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of professional football, Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have both found themselves on the sidelines, not as starting quarterbacks in the NFL. However, the narratives surrounding these two athletes could not be more different. Tebow is widely regarded as a respected figure, known for his positive demeanor and commitment to his beliefs, while Kaepernick has faced significant criticism, particularly for his controversial actions during the National Anthem.

Tebow recently addressed Kaepernick's protests, which sparked national debate when he chose to kneel during the National Anthem to draw attention to social issues. Tebow emphasized the importance of standing for one’s beliefs but suggested that there are appropriate ways to express those convictions. His comments reflect a broader sentiment that while advocating for change is vital, the manner in which one does so can significantly impact public perception.

The article takes a critical stance on Kaepernick, labeling him a high-paid bench player who should consider using his personal time for protests rather than making them a focal point during professional games. This perspective raises questions about the appropriateness of using a platform meant for sports to address political issues, suggesting that athletes should focus on their careers instead.

Furthermore, the author dismisses claims of oppression in the United States, arguing that such assertions are indicative of laziness. Citing the presidency of Barack Obama as a counterpoint, the article posits that the existence of opportunities in America contradicts the narrative of systemic oppression. This viewpoint suggests that those who claim to be oppressed are merely making excuses for not seizing the opportunities available to them.

In contrast, Tebow is portrayed as a wise individual who has managed to avoid negative press, focusing instead on his aspirations within Major League Baseball, particularly with hopes of securing a spot on the New York Mets. His approach to life and career is seen as a model for young athletes, emphasizing hard work and dedication over controversy.

As the article draws to a close, it reinforces the notion that Tebow’s path is one of respect and ambition, while Kaepernick’s actions are framed in a less favorable light. The final remarks serve as a derogatory jab at Kaepernick, encapsulating the article's overall sentiment that while one athlete seeks to uplift and inspire, the other is mired in controversy and criticism.

In the end, the contrasting images of Tebow and Kaepernick serve as a reflection of how personal beliefs and public actions can shape an athlete's legacy in the eyes of fans and the media alike.",-6.0,2.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,480.0,0.125,0.004166666666666667
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

The ongoing debate surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border wall has intensified, with proponents emphasizing its role as a crucial national security measure beyond merely curbing illegal immigration. Historical parallels are drawn to China's Great Wall, originally constructed to fend off foreign invaders rather than immigrants, underscoring the wall's intended purpose in safeguarding the nation.

The current landscape along the southern border is fraught with challenges, particularly due to the significant influence of drug cartels in Mexico. These criminal organizations have contributed to a staggering death toll, raising alarms about the potential for further violence spilling over into the United States. The unsecured southern border not only facilitates illegal immigration but also poses a serious risk of terrorist groups, such as ISIS, exploiting the situation to gain entry into the U.S.

A recent incident has brought these concerns to the forefront. Eight Syrian nationals were intercepted while attempting to illegally cross into the United States from Mexico. The apprehension occurred at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, highlighting the vulnerabilities present at the border. Reports from unnamed federal agents and Border Patrol Council President Hector Garza indicate that this incident is part of a larger trend, where many illegal entrants are not deported, complicating efforts to maintain border security.

Garza has voiced strong support for enhancing border security measures, emphasizing the need for increased resources and backing for Border Patrol agents who are on the front lines of this ongoing battle. The challenges they face are compounded by the sheer volume of individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, many of whom evade deportation, further straining the system.

In the political arena, one presidential candidate has emerged as a vocal advocate for addressing these pressing border security issues. This candidate has positioned themselves as the only one willing to confront the complexities of border security head-on, promising to implement strategies that prioritize national safety while also addressing the humanitarian aspects of immigration.

As the situation at the southern border continues to evolve, the call for stronger security measures remains a focal point of discussion among lawmakers and citizens alike. The border wall, once a contentious topic, is increasingly viewed through the lens of national security, with advocates arguing that it is essential to protect the United States from both criminal elements and potential terrorist threats.",-13.0,-28.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,434.0,-2.0,-0.06451612903225806

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

In a recent gathering, a group of Haitians expressed their support for former President Donald Trump, cheering enthusiastically as he listened to their personal stories. The atmosphere was charged with positive sentiments towards Trump, who appeared receptive to the audience's experiences.

However, the media's engagement with the event was notably brief. Reporters departed early, seemingly uninterested in the audience's perspectives and complaints. Many attendees voiced their dissatisfaction with the Clintons, particularly criticizing their lack of follow-up after receiving substantial donations intended for Haiti's recovery efforts.

The audience raised serious concerns about the misappropriation of funds, suggesting that money meant to aid Haiti had instead benefited Washington lobbyists. This sentiment was echoed in their accusations against Hillary Clinton, whom they claimed obstructed efforts to raise Haiti's daily minimum wage from a meager $3 to $5.

As the audience's support for Trump and their criticisms of Hillary Clinton became increasingly apparent, the media found no newsworthy content to report and chose to leave. This decision has drawn ire from the audience, who felt their voices were dismissed and their concerns overlooked.

In a striking conclusion, the audience's frustration with the media's early departure underscores a growing disconnect between the press and the communities they report on, leaving many to wonder about the true priorities of modern journalism.",-2.0,-10.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,261.0,-1.0,-0.038314176245210725
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate of heightened concern over terrorism, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reignited a contentious debate by proposing a ban on Muslim immigration until a better understanding of terrorism is achieved. This proposal has sparked significant backlash, particularly from Democrats, who have labeled it as racist. However, the argument presented in a recent article contends that racism is fundamentally tied to race, not religion, suggesting that the discourse surrounding Trump's proposal may be mischaracterized.

The article further explores the complexities of Islam and its potential to lead to radicalization, citing various instances of violence perpetrated by extremists. This perspective resonates with a growing segment of the Australian population, as evidenced by a new poll indicating that 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration. This figure marks a notable increase from just 28% in October of the previous year, highlighting a significant shift in public sentiment.

The poll also reveals that 48% of voters are in favor of initiating a national debate on the issue, reflecting a desire for open dialogue regarding the implications of Muslim immigration. This sentiment is echoed by two-thirds of Australians who believe that populist senator Pauline Hanson addresses topics that other politicians tend to avoid. Hanson's outspoken views on immigration and national security have resonated with many, further fueling the conversation around this contentious issue.

Support for a ban on Muslim immigration is not confined to a single political affiliation. The poll indicates that 60% of Coalition voters, 40% of Labour voters, and 34% of Green voters are in favor of such a measure. This cross-party support underscores the widespread concerns regarding terrorism and the integration of Muslim migrants into Australian society. Many Australians cite fears of terrorism as a primary reason for their support, alongside apprehensions about the ability of Muslim migrants to assimilate into the cultural fabric of the nation.

The pollster behind the survey expressed surprise at the substantial backing for the ban, suggesting that it reflects broader societal views that may not have been fully acknowledged in mainstream political discourse. This growing support for a ban on Muslim immigration raises important questions about the future of Australia's immigration policies and the potential for increased polarization on this issue.

In the context of this debate, the article critiques the approach taken by prominent political figures such as Hillary Clinton, who have opposed views like Trump's without engaging with the underlying concerns of the electorate. The article posits that acknowledging dissenting opinions and addressing the fears that drive support for a ban could be a more effective strategy for political leaders. By fostering a dialogue that respects differing viewpoints, politicians may be able to bridge the divide and work towards solutions that address the complexities of immigration and national security.

As the conversation around Muslim immigration continues to evolve, it is clear that the Australian public is increasingly willing to engage with these challenging topics. The rise in support for a ban on Muslim immigration, coupled with the desire for a national debate, signals a pivotal moment in the nation's approach to immigration policy. With fears of terrorism and integration at the forefront of public consciousness, the implications of this debate will likely shape the political landscape in Australia for years to come.",2.0,19.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,615.0,0.9047619047619048,0.030894308943089432

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a shocking turn of events, a chaotic incident unfolded in the middle of a street, where a fight was anticipated. Eyewitnesses were left reeling as the situation escalated dramatically when an individual unexpectedly set those involved in the altercation on fire. The scene quickly transformed into a disturbing spectacle, with people running in all directions, desperately trying to avoid being struck by oncoming vehicles.

The author of a recent article addressing the incident has found themselves at the center of controversy, as Buzzfeed has claimed that their description of the crime and its victims is false. However, the author has firmly debunked these allegations, standing by their account of the harrowing events that transpired.

As the chaos unfolded, the author took a moment to reflect on the mindset of the individual who threw the Molotov cocktail, suggesting a level of premeditation that raises serious concerns about public safety. The act of setting individuals ablaze during a fight is not only alarming but also indicative of a troubling trend in societal behavior.

In a nostalgic reflection, the author contrasts the current state of affairs with a time when bystanders would actively intervene to prevent harm during fights. This longing for a more compassionate past highlights a significant shift in societal norms, where the instinct to help has seemingly been replaced by a desire to capture and share shocking moments for viral content. The author criticizes this modern tendency, emphasizing that the impulse to record events for social media often overshadows the moral obligation to assist those in danger.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of inaction in the face of violence. As the streets become battlegrounds for chaotic encounters, the question remains: what has led to this alarming change in behavior? The author’s reflections prompt a broader discussion about the role of the community in ensuring safety and the importance of prioritizing human life over the fleeting allure of online fame.

As the investigation into the incident continues, the community is left grappling with the implications of such violence and the need for a collective response to restore a sense of safety and responsibility.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- A border wall is deemed necessary for securing access points into America, beyond just preventing illegal immigration.

Luna County, New Mexico, is currently on high alert following a recent traffic stop that involved an undocumented woman from the Middle East. The incident has raised significant concerns regarding national security, particularly in relation to potential terrorist activities. Law enforcement officials are scrutinizing the situation, especially given the woman’s reported interest in a nearby gas pipeline.

The gas pipeline, located in a remote area, has sparked speculation that the woman may have been scouting for future attacks. This has prompted investigations by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol. Fortunately, initial investigations have not uncovered any immediate threats, but the presence of an undocumented Muslim woman near the U.S.-Mexico border has left many feeling uneasy.

The situation is further complicated by a 2015 report from Judicial Watch, which indicated a troubling collaboration between Mexican cartels and terrorist organizations. This partnership reportedly facilitates the smuggling of individuals from terror-afflicted nations into the United States. Additionally, a 2017 report highlighted that Islamic terror groups based in Mexico have crossed the border to scout potential targets, raising alarms about the vulnerabilities along the southern border.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call for Congress to allocate funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Advocates argue that the wall is essential not only for preventing illegal immigration but also for safeguarding the nation against potential terrorist infiltration. The argument is that many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not solely from Mexico; rather, they often travel from further south, sometimes with the support of the Mexican government.

The recent traffic stop serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with unsecured access points into America. Proponents of the border wall contend that it is a necessary measure to protect the nation from foreign threats, including terrorism. They argue that without enhanced security measures, it would be relatively easy for a terrorist to enter the U.S. through the southern border.

As the investigation continues and law enforcement remains vigilant, the incident underscores the complex challenges facing border security. The need for a comprehensive approach to immigration and national security has never been more pressing, as officials work to ensure the safety of American citizens while addressing the multifaceted issues surrounding illegal immigration and potential terrorist activities. The call for a fortified border remains a contentious topic, but the recent events in Luna County have reignited discussions about the importance of securing the nation’s borders.",-44.0,-29.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,468.0,-1.6111111111111112,-0.06196581196581197
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a world where the pressures of professional sports often overshadow personal values, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out as a beacon of hope and inspiration. Wilson, known for his impressive skills on the field, emphasizes a profound love for God and a commitment to helping others. His mission transcends the game of football; he aims to serve and change lives, aspiring to leave a legacy filled with joy.

On the field, Wilson is laser-focused on winning games and leading his team to victory. However, his priorities shift dramatically when he steps off the turf. Off the field, he dedicates himself to promoting joy and peace, driven by his faith and the belief that good choices can lead to a fulfilling life. This duality of purpose showcases Wilson's understanding that while competition is vital in sports, the impact one has on the community and the lives of others is equally, if not more, important.

Despite the NFL's advice to refrain from discussing his faith publicly, Wilson remains steadfast in sharing his message through his actions. He believes that living out his faith is the most powerful testimony he can offer. By prioritizing God first, followed by family and friends, and then football, Wilson asserts that this order leads to great outcomes, both personally and professionally. His approach serves as a reminder that success is not solely measured by accolades or statistics but by the positive influence one can have on those around them.

Wilson's perspective extends beyond his personal life and into the realm of leadership. He critiques individuals in power who, in his view, forget their roots and use their influence for self-glorification. This critique resonates deeply in today's political climate, where corruption and deception seem to permeate the highest levels of leadership. Wilson's call for integrity and authenticity serves as a clarion call for those in positions of power to remember their responsibilities to the people they serve.

The article raises concerns about a perceived double standard regarding freedom of speech, particularly when it comes to expressing faith. While various messages are celebrated and encouraged, discussions surrounding faith often face scrutiny and pushback. This inconsistency raises questions about the values society holds dear and the importance of allowing individuals to express their beliefs without fear of retribution.

Moreover, the author questions when the act of helping others became viewed negatively. In a time when selflessness and compassion should be celebrated, there seems to be a growing trend of skepticism towards those who prioritize service over self-interest. Wilson's unwavering commitment to standing for truth and righteousness serves as a reminder that helping others is not just a noble pursuit but a fundamental aspect of humanity.

In conclusion, Russell Wilson's journey as a quarterback and a person of faith illustrates the profound impact one individual can have on the world. His dedication to serving others, promoting joy, and standing firm in his beliefs sets a powerful example for athletes and non-athletes alike. As he continues to navigate the complexities of professional sports and personal values, Wilson remains a testament to the idea that true success lies not in personal glory but in the lives we touch and the legacies we leave behind.",79.0,91.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,607.0,3.7916666666666665,0.14991762767710048
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a recent address, Pope Francis delivered a poignant critique of fear-based media, drawing a stark comparison to the insidious nature of terrorism. His remarks, while primarily directed at the Italian press, were intended to resonate on a global scale, highlighting the pervasive impact of sensationalist journalism.

The Pope underscored the dangers of journalism that thrives on gossip and rumors, asserting that such practices can inflict significant harm on individuals and society as a whole. He articulated a vision of media that should uplift and inform rather than instill fear and anxiety. By invoking the words of former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Pope emphasized the destructive nature of fear-mongering, reminding listeners that fear can paralyze communities and distort public perception.

Despite a notable decrease in crime rates, the Pope's comments come at a time when fear levels among Americans have reached a decade-high. Polls indicate that rising concerns about terrorism and crime are heavily influenced by media narratives, which often amplify public anxiety. This growing fear is not merely a reflection of reality but rather a construct shaped by the media landscape.

Among the outlets identified as a significant contributor to this climate of fear is Fox News. The Pope's critique aligns with broader concerns regarding how certain media platforms can exacerbate public anxiety and influence political outcomes. The rise of figures like Donald Trump has been linked to the narratives propagated by such outlets, which often prioritize sensationalism over factual reporting.

Pope Francis's remarks serve as a call to action for journalists and media consumers alike. He advocates for a responsible approach to news reporting, one that prioritizes truth and integrity over sensationalism and fear. By fostering a media environment that values accuracy and compassion, the Pope believes society can combat the pervasive culture of fear that has taken hold.

As the media landscape continues to evolve, the Pope's message resonates with a growing audience that seeks to challenge the status quo. In an age where information is readily accessible, the responsibility lies with both journalists and consumers to discern fact from fiction and to resist the allure of fear-based narratives.

In conclusion, Pope Francis's critique of fear-based media highlights a critical issue facing societies worldwide. By addressing the harmful effects of sensationalism and fear-mongering, he calls for a renewed commitment to ethical journalism that serves to inform and unite rather than divide and instill fear. As the world grapples with complex challenges, the Pope's message serves as a reminder of the power of media to shape perceptions and the importance of fostering a more informed and compassionate public discourse.",-56.0,-35.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,490.0,-1.8421052631578947,-0.07142857142857142
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

In a highly anticipated first general election debate, CNN polling has declared Hillary Clinton the winner, with a significant 62% of respondents favoring her performance. However, snap polls from various sources, including TIME Magazine and CBS New York, suggest a different narrative, indicating Donald Trump as the debate night victor. This divergence in polling results has sparked discussions about the reliability of the data, particularly given CNN's sample, which is perceived to lean Democratic.

The debate covered several contentious topics, including the Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and Trump's tax returns. These issues have been central to the candidates' campaigns and were expected to draw sharp contrasts between their platforms. Following the debate, Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude to his supporters for their favorable polling, while Clinton has yet to make a public comment regarding the debate outcomes.

Despite Clinton's apparent win in the CNN poll, the mixed results raise questions about whether this will translate into a shift in voter behavior as the election date approaches. The candidates have limited time to influence undecided voters, making each debate crucial in shaping public perception.

Adding to the debate's drama, Trump voiced his frustration over a defective microphone, suggesting it hindered his performance. He also mentioned that he should have brought up Bill Clinton's infidelity during the discussion, a move that could have added another layer of controversy to the already heated exchange.

In a further twist, Julian Assange has hinted at an impending ""October surprise"" release on Wikileaks, which could potentially impact Clinton's campaign. As the election draws near, both candidates are under pressure to solidify their positions and sway the electorate in their favor.

With the stakes higher than ever, the fallout from the debate will likely continue to unfold, influencing the strategies of both campaigns as they navigate the final stretch leading to Election Day.",18.0,7.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,373.0,0.5384615384615384,0.01876675603217158
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

In the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, Hillary Clinton confidently declared victory, yet the reactions from various focus groups and social media suggest a more complex narrative. While Clinton's camp celebrated her performance, the sentiment among viewers appears to be divided.

Focus groups conducted by both Fox News and CNN indicated a favorable outcome for Clinton. CNN's analysis, which included a group of Florida voters, reported an overwhelming 18-2 split in her favor. Similarly, Fox News, with a focus group from Pennsylvania, showed a 16-6 advantage for Clinton. These results seem to bolster her claim of victory, but the broader public reaction paints a different picture.

Pollster Frank Luntz observed that while Trump struggled with his comments regarding taxes, he gained traction when addressing Clinton's email scandal. This shift in momentum may have contributed to the mixed reactions following the debate. Additionally, Trump faced significant backlash when he attempted to explain his long-standing questioning of President Obama's birthplace, a topic that has been a point of contention throughout his campaign.

In a surprising twist, an alternative poll emerged showing Trump with a commanding lead, winning 92% to 8%. This stark contrast to the focus group findings raises questions about the overall perception of the debate among the general public.

Following Clinton's victory tweet, social media erupted with criticism, leading to the trending hashtag #TrumpWon globally. This online backlash highlights the disconnect between Clinton's self-proclaimed victory and the sentiments expressed by many viewers.

Critics have also pointed out Clinton's tendency to avoid media interactions following debates, which may further complicate her narrative. As the dust settles from the debate, it remains to be seen how these contrasting perceptions will influence the upcoming election. With both candidates facing their own challenges, the road ahead promises to be anything but predictable.",18.0,25.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,360.0,1.5625,0.06944444444444445
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted in Charlotte for the second consecutive night in response to the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, a tragic event that has reignited longstanding tensions between African-American communities and law enforcement. The demonstrations, which began peacefully, took a violent turn when a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured during the unrest.

The circumstances surrounding the shooting have become a focal point of contention, with police asserting that the shooter was a civilian. However, eyewitness accounts paint a different picture, suggesting that the gunfire originated from law enforcement officers. Todd Zimmer, an eyewitness to the events, took to Twitter to express his disbelief, stating, “The city is lying about the incident.” His comments reflect a growing frustration among protesters who feel that the official narrative does not align with their experiences.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, corroborated Zimmer's claims. Meyer reported that the protest was initially peaceful, with demonstrators chanting “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” a phrase that has become emblematic of the movement against police violence. According to Meyer, the atmosphere shifted dramatically when police arrived in riot gear and formed a barrier, escalating tensions and ultimately leading to the shooting of a protester.

Eyewitnesses described the sound of the gunfire as significantly louder than that of a typical firearm, further suggesting police involvement in the incident. This detail has raised questions about the police's use of force and their response to the protests, which were largely peaceful until the arrival of law enforcement in tactical gear.

In the wake of the shooting, the City of Charlotte quickly issued a statement asserting that the incident was a case of civilian-on-civilian violence. However, this assertion has been met with skepticism from those who witnessed the events unfold. Additional eyewitness accounts from clergy members and other protesters have contradicted the police's narrative, indicating that law enforcement may have been responsible for the shooting.

The protests in Charlotte are not an isolated incident but rather part of a broader pattern of unrest that has emerged in cities across the United States in response to police violence against African-American individuals. The killing of Kenneth L. Scott has become a rallying point for those demanding justice and accountability from law enforcement agencies.

As the protests continue, demonstrators are calling for a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Scott's death and the subsequent shooting of the civilian. The community is demanding transparency and accountability from the police, who have faced increasing scrutiny over their tactics and treatment of minority communities.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by African-American communities in their fight for justice and equality. The protests highlight the urgent need for reform within law enforcement agencies and a reevaluation of the relationship between police and the communities they serve.

As the night wore on, the atmosphere remained charged, with protesters vowing to continue their demonstrations until their demands are met. The calls for justice echo throughout the city, as residents seek to honor the memory of Kenneth L. Scott and ensure that his death does not go unnoticed or unpunished.

In the days to come, the city of Charlotte will likely face increased pressure to address the concerns raised by the protesters and to provide clarity on the events that transpired during the demonstrations. The community's resilience and determination to seek justice for Kenneth L. Scott and the injured civilian will undoubtedly shape the narrative surrounding this tragic incident.

As the protests unfold, the eyes of the nation remain on Charlotte, where the fight for justice continues to resonate deeply within the hearts of those who have taken to the streets. The outcome of these demonstrations may have far-reaching implications for the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve, as well as for the broader movement advocating for racial justice and police reform across the country. 

The events in Charlotte are a poignant reminder of the work that still lies ahead in the pursuit of equality and justice for all. As the community rallies together, the hope for change remains alive, fueled by the voices of those who refuse to be silenced in the face of injustice.",-74.0,-46.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,791.0,-1.7037037037037037,-0.05815423514538559
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, finds himself under increasing scrutiny for his foreign policy stance, particularly regarding Russia. Critics have raised alarms over what appears to be a troubling alignment with Vladimir Putin and the Russian regime, suggesting that Trump's connections to Russian interests could compromise U.S. foreign policy.

Reports indicate that Trump is surrounded by individuals with close ties to the Kremlin, raising questions about the influence these relationships may have on his political decisions. Furthermore, Trump has reportedly received support from Russian state-controlled media and intelligence services, which adds another layer of complexity to his candidacy. 

In a bid to quell concerns about his connections to Russia, Trump has publicly asserted that he has no business ties to the country. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,” he stated emphatically. However, an investigation by ABC News has uncovered evidence that contradicts this claim, revealing that Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in business dealings.

Among the ventures that have raised eyebrows are Trump's dealings with Russian oligarchs, who have amassed significant wealth since the transition to a free-market economy in Russia. Notably, Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and has sold real estate to Russian buyers, both of which have been lucrative for him. These transactions have led to allegations that Russian oligarchs, who often use their wealth to support the Putin regime, may be leveraging their investments in Trump properties as a means to launder money.

The implications of these connections are profound. Former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev has characterized these oligarchs as materialistic and culturally ignorant, suggesting that their motivations are primarily financial rather than aligned with any broader ideological goals. This characterization raises further questions about the nature of Trump's relationships with these individuals and the potential impact on U.S. foreign policy.

The situation becomes even more concerning in light of the sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs by the U.S. State Department in 2014. With Trump potentially seeking the presidency again, there are fears that he might advocate for lifting these sanctions, which could serve his personal financial interests. This prospect has led to a growing chorus of voices questioning whether Trump could effectively separate his personal financial interests from U.S. foreign policy regarding Russia.

The potential for conflicts of interest is not merely a theoretical concern; it poses a tangible threat to the integrity of U.S. governance. Critics argue that Trump's financial entanglements with Russian interests could lead to decisions that prioritize his personal gain over national security. This has prompted calls for Congress to take action, with some advocating for impeachment proceedings against Trump based on these conflicts of interest.

As the election draws nearer, the implications of Trump's ties to Russia will likely remain a focal point of debate. The intersection of personal finance and foreign policy is a delicate balance, and many are questioning whether Trump is capable of navigating this terrain without compromising the interests of the United States.

In summary, the scrutiny surrounding Donald Trump's foreign policy and his connections to Russia is intensifying. With allegations of numerous ties to Russian interests and concerns about potential conflicts of interest, the implications for U.S. foreign policy are significant. As the political landscape evolves, the call for accountability and transparency in Trump's dealings with Russia will likely continue to resonate among lawmakers and the public alike. The question remains: can Trump truly separate his personal financial interests from the responsibilities of leading the nation? The answer may have profound implications for the future of U.S. foreign policy and its relationship with Russia.",27.0,8.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,694.0,0.3076923076923077,0.011527377521613832
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing the looming threat of impeachment as state legislators weigh the possibility of filing articles against him in connection with the controversial ""Bridgegate"" scandal. The scandal, which revolves around the orchestrated closures of the George Washington Bridge, has raised serious questions about Christie's conduct and his potential culpability in using the closures as a means to punish a political rival.

Top state legislators are currently deliberating the next steps, with the decision to proceed with impeachment resting in the hands of Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. If Prieto approves, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would initiate the impeachment process. A majority vote from the 80-member Assembly would be required to move forward with impeachment, while a two-thirds majority in the Senate would be necessary for a conviction.

The scandal has gained renewed attention following a recent trial involving three of Christie's senior aides, during which federal prosecutors implicated the governor in the scheme. The bridge closures, which resulted in significant traffic jams, have been linked to the tragic death of one individual who was unable to reach a hospital in time due to the delays. This incident has intensified scrutiny on Christie's actions and decisions during the crisis.

In a significant development, a judge has ordered Christie to produce personal emails related to the Bridgegate scandal, further complicating his position. The revelation that Christie was informed about the situation during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013, yet failed to take any action, has raised additional concerns regarding his leadership and accountability. This information contradicts Christie's previous assertions, as he had denied any knowledge of the scandal during a press conference shortly after his re-election in 2014.

The implications of the Bridgegate scandal extend beyond New Jersey politics, as Christie serves as the chairperson of Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump’s transition team. His involvement in the scandal raises questions about how it may affect Trump's campaign, particularly as Christie has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party. The potential fallout from the impeachment process could have significant ramifications for both Christie and Trump, as the governor's political future hangs in the balance.

Christie's endorsement of Trump in March 2016 was seen by many as a pivotal moment in his career, marking a shift that some viewed as a decline in his political standing. As the situation continues to unfold, the governor's ability to navigate the challenges posed by the Bridgegate scandal will be closely monitored by both supporters and critics alike.

As the state legislature considers its options, the political landscape in New Jersey remains uncertain. The potential for impeachment adds a layer of complexity to Christie's already tumultuous tenure as governor.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a September 2015 Republican primary debate, Donald Trump made a bold assertion regarding his past interactions with Jeb Bush concerning casino gambling in Florida. Trump claimed, “I never lobbied Jeb Bush for casino gambling. If I wanted to, I would have succeeded.” This statement, however, has sparked significant controversy and raised questions about the veracity of Trump’s claims, particularly in light of his previous admissions.

In a deposition from 2007, Trump acknowledged that he did indeed push for casino gambling in Florida, a stark contradiction to his claims made during the debate. This discrepancy leads to a troubling inquiry: Did Trump lie during the debate, or did he commit perjury in his deposition? The implications of either scenario are serious, as they suggest a pattern of dishonesty that could undermine the integrity of his statements and actions.

The debate exchange not only highlights Trump’s claims but also brings to light Jeb Bush’s assertion that Trump sought to influence him through campaign contributions. This assertion adds another layer to the ongoing dispute over Trump’s attempts to introduce casino gambling in Florida, which faced staunch opposition from Bush, who was then the governor of the state. The tension between the two figures illustrates a broader conflict over gambling legislation and the influence of money in politics.

The seriousness of Trump’s alleged dishonesty cannot be overstated. Comparisons have been drawn between Trump’s situation and the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced charges for lying under oath. Clinton’s impeachment was a significant moment in American political history, and the parallels to Trump’s current predicament raise questions about accountability and the rule of law. If Trump is found to have lied, it could have far-reaching consequences for his political career and the trust placed in him by the American public.

Moreover, the article argues that Trump’s tendency to distort the truth poses a danger to national safety. In an era where misinformation can spread rapidly and influence public opinion, the potential for a leader to mislead the public is a matter of grave concern. The stakes are high, and the integrity of political discourse is at risk when leaders make statements that are not grounded in fact.

To provide readers with a clearer understanding of the situation, the article includes transcripts from both the debate and the 2007 deposition. These documents allow the public to evaluate the claims themselves and draw their own conclusions about the truthfulness of Trump’s statements. The juxtaposition of Trump’s words in the debate against his earlier admissions creates a compelling narrative that demands scrutiny.

As the debate over Trump’s honesty continues, there is a growing call to action for Congress to consider impeachment based on his alleged crimes. The gravity of the situation cannot be ignored, and the potential consequences of allowing such behavior to go unchecked could set a dangerous precedent for future leaders. The American public deserves transparency and accountability from those in power, and the current circumstances surrounding Trump’s statements warrant serious consideration.

In conclusion, the discrepancies between Trump’s claims during the 2015 debate and his admissions in the 2007 deposition raise significant questions about his integrity and honesty. The implications of these contradictions extend beyond personal accountability; they touch on the broader issues of trust in leadership and the importance of truthful discourse in politics. As the nation grapples with these issues, the call for accountability and transparency remains more crucial than ever. The American people must demand that their leaders uphold the truth, for the health of democracy relies on it.",-29.0,-25.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,695.0,-0.9615384615384616,-0.03597122302158273
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a drinking game during a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN.

- The Surgeon General cautioned that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related issues following the debate.
- Viewers were advised to drink responsibly during upcoming debates, suggesting ""baby sips"" for Trump's lies.","**Surgeon General Warns Against Drinking Games During CNN Debate**

In a striking reminder of the potential dangers associated with drinking games, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a warning ahead of a recent 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN. Many viewers engaged in a drinking game, consuming alcohol each time former President Donald Trump made a false statement. Murthy cautioned that such a practice could lead to serious health risks, including alcohol poisoning.

The Surgeon General's concerns are not unfounded. In 2012, there were approximately 70,000 incidents of alcohol poisoning linked to drinking games during political debates. With the current Republican candidates, Murthy emphasized the need for caution, particularly given Trump's history of misleading statements. Prior to the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton on September 26, 2016, Murthy had already reiterated the dangers of drinking whenever Trump lied.

A recent study by Politico highlighted the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, revealing that he told 87 lies over a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, averaging a lie every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Based on this average, it is estimated that Trump likely made around 28 false statements during the CNN debate, raising significant concerns about the safety of viewers participating in drinking games.

In light of these statistics, Murthy warned that first responders were on alert for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate. He urged viewers to drink responsibly, suggesting a more cautious approach, such as taking ""baby sips"" whenever Trump made a false claim. This advice aims to mitigate the risks associated with excessive drinking during political events.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the Surgeon General's warnings serve as a crucial reminder of the importance of moderation and responsibility, especially during high-stakes debates that can provoke strong emotions and reactions. With the upcoming debates on the horizon, viewers are encouraged to prioritize their health and safety while engaging in political discourse.",-17.0,-14.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,360.0,-1.0,-0.03888888888888889
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the wake of a recent debate, mainstream media outlets have widely declared Hillary Clinton the victor, praising her performance and articulating a strong case for her candidacy. However, a contrasting narrative has emerged from online platforms, where polls and Twitter trends suggest a different outcome. The hashtag #TrumpWon has surged in popularity across the United States, indicating a significant portion of the online audience believes Donald Trump performed better.

Interestingly, the hashtag #TrumpWon has been traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia, raising concerns about the influence of foreign entities on American political discourse. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has been known to employ cyber-trolls as part of a broader strategy to promote his agenda through disinformation campaigns. These trolls are tasked with flooding American social media with content that is both pro-Trump and pro-Putin, effectively blurring the lines between genuine public sentiment and orchestrated propaganda.

The motivations behind these efforts are clear. Putin aims to manipulate Trump into lifting the economic sanctions that were imposed following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. By fostering a favorable online environment for Trump, the Russian government seeks to undermine the sanctions and regain economic footholds that have been lost due to international pressure.

Reports from former bloggers who have worked in this environment describe their conditions as harsh, with strict oversight and severe penalties for non-compliance. This raises critical questions about the authenticity of online interactions and the potential for manipulation by foreign actors. As the debate continues over the implications of these findings, experts warn against placing undue trust in online polls and engaging with accounts that may be linked to Russian trolls.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call for accountability within the U.S. political system. Advocates are urging Congress to take decisive action, including the impeachment of Donald Trump, as a response to the perceived threats posed by foreign interference in American democracy. The intersection of media narratives, online sentiment, and foreign influence presents a complex landscape that demands careful scrutiny and proactive measures to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process. 

As the nation grapples with these issues, the importance of discerning fact from fiction in the digital age has never been more critical. The implications of this debate extend far beyond the immediate political landscape, touching on the very foundations of democratic engagement and public trust.",-9.0,11.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,442.0,0.6470588235294118,0.024886877828054297
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor. The lawsuit alleges that the company has engaged in systematic discrimination against Asian job applicants during its hiring process, raising significant concerns about the fairness and integrity of its employment practices.

As a contractor for the federal government, including agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA), Palantir is expected to adhere to strict non-discriminatory hiring standards. However, the Department of Labor's lawsuit claims that the company has failed to meet these obligations. The allegations stem from an analysis of the hiring outcomes for engineering intern positions, where a striking disparity was noted among applicants based on their ethnicity.

According to the lawsuit, out of 130 applicants for engineering intern roles, a staggering 73% identified as Asian. Despite this high representation, the hiring results were markedly skewed, with only four Asian candidates being hired compared to 17 non-Asian candidates. This outcome raises serious questions about the hiring practices at Palantir, particularly given the statistical improbability of such a result occurring by chance. The likelihood of this hiring outcome happening randomly is estimated to be one in a billion, suggesting a potential pattern of discrimination that warrants further investigation.

Peter Thiel, who has been a significant figure in the tech industry as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has a complex public persona. A first-generation immigrant himself, Thiel has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, who has taken a hardline stance against immigration. This juxtaposition of Thiel's background and his political affiliations adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing lawsuit, as it raises questions about the values and practices within the company he controls.

Thiel is no stranger to controversy. He gained widespread attention for his financial backing of Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, which ultimately led to the bankruptcy of the site. Additionally, Thiel made headlines during the Republican National Convention when he became the first openly gay speaker to acknowledge his sexual orientation at the event. His speech was notable not only for its historic nature but also for its criticism of government incompetence and the Republican Party's anti-LGBT platform, which was characterized as the most anti-LGBT in the party's history.

In light of the allegations, the Department of Labor has reiterated the importance of non-discriminatory hiring practices, particularly for federal contractors like Palantir. The agency emphasized that it is imperative for companies that engage with the federal government to ensure that their hiring processes are fair and equitable, free from bias based on race or ethnicity.

In response to the lawsuit, a spokeswoman for Palantir stated that the company intends to defend itself vigorously against the allegations. The firm has expressed its commitment to fair hiring practices and has indicated that it will contest the claims made by the Department of Labor. As the case unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor how Palantir addresses these serious allegations and what implications they may have for its future operations and reputation.

The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching consequences not only for Palantir but also for the broader tech industry, particularly in how companies approach diversity and inclusion in their hiring practices. As the scrutiny on employment discrimination intensifies, firms that fail to uphold equitable hiring standards may face significant legal and reputational risks.

As the legal proceedings progress, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how Palantir navigates this challenging situation and whether it can restore confidence in its hiring practices amidst these serious allegations. The case serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges related to diversity and inclusion in the workplace, particularly within industries that play a critical role in national security and public service.",-18.0,-12.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,710.0,-0.48,-0.016901408450704224

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

The investigation into the Chelsea bombing that occurred last Saturday, injuring 29 people, is gaining momentum as police pursue several significant leads. The attack, which sent shockwaves through the community, has prompted law enforcement to delve deeper into the circumstances surrounding the incident.

In a critical development, a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster just four blocks away from the site of the initial explosion. This discovery has raised alarms and intensified the urgency of the investigation, as authorities work to determine whether the two incidents are connected.

Three significant leads have emerged that may provide insight into the motivations behind the bombing. The first lead involves a hand-written letter, partially in Arabic, that was found alongside the second bomb. The contents of this letter are currently under examination, as investigators seek to decipher its meaning and relevance to the ongoing investigation.

The second lead comes from an unidentified male caller who contacted 911 to issue a chilling warning about potential further explosions. The caller ominously stated, “There will be more,” raising concerns about the possibility of additional attacks and prompting law enforcement to heighten security measures in the area.

The third lead is a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ which claims to serve as the bomber's manifesto. This post expresses grievances against various societal issues, including the oppression of the LGBTQ+ community and other inequalities. The individual behind the post claims responsibility for the explosions, stating, “This is not the end, this is just the beginning.” This declaration has alarmed authorities, who are now assessing the credibility of the claims made on the platform.

While the emergence of these leads has provided some direction for investigators, there is a growing skepticism regarding the authenticity of the claims made on the Tumblr page. Concerns have been raised that individuals may be attempting to exploit the situation for attention, casting doubt on whether the person behind the post is genuinely connected to the bombing or simply seeking notoriety.

As the investigation unfolds, police are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. The community is on high alert, with many residents expressing fear and uncertainty in the wake of the attack. Local officials have emphasized the importance of cooperation between law enforcement and the public to ensure safety and security in the area.

The Chelsea bombing has not only left a physical mark on the community but has also sparked conversations about broader societal issues. The motivations cited in the Tumblr post have ignited discussions about the treatment of marginalized groups and the need for greater awareness and action against societal inequalities.

As investigators continue to sift through evidence and analyze the leads, the community remains hopeful for answers and justice. The police department has committed to keeping the public informed as new developments arise in the case.

In the meantime, residents are encouraged to stay alert and report any information that may assist in the investigation. The Chelsea bombing serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities faced by urban communities and the ongoing challenges in addressing issues of violence and discrimination.

As the investigation progresses, the focus remains on uncovering the truth behind the bombing and ensuring the safety of the community. The police are determined to bring those responsible to justice and restore a sense of security to the area.",-25.0,3.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,626.0,0.12,0.004792332268370607
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As Donald Trump intensifies his campaign efforts at the age of 70, questions surrounding his mental fitness for an upcoming debate with Hillary Clinton have come to the forefront. With a rigorous schedule that keeps him on the campaign trail, Trump is preparing for what many consider a pivotal moment in his political journey.

However, just less than 24 hours before the highly anticipated debate, Trump took to social media, posting a tweet that has raised eyebrows among political analysts and supporters alike. The tweet, which appeared disjointed and incoherent, touched on three unrelated topics: a shooting in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina. This unexpected combination of subjects has led to speculation about the state of Trump's mental acuity as he gears up for the debate.

Critics have pointed to the tweet as indicative of a wandering mind, suggesting that such disorganized messaging could reflect a broader issue regarding his readiness to engage in a high-stakes debate. The implications of this tweet are significant, as they not only raise concerns about Trump's ability to articulate his positions clearly but also hint at a potential decline in his campaign's overall effectiveness.

The debate with Clinton is expected to be a critical moment for Trump, who has been working tirelessly to rally support and solidify his base. However, the recent tweet has cast a shadow over his preparations, leading some to question whether he is fully equipped to handle the pressures of the debate stage. 

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the ramifications of Trump's mental fitness will likely play a crucial role in shaping public perception and voter sentiment. With the debate looming, the focus will be on whether Trump can effectively communicate his message and counter Clinton's arguments, or if his recent behavior signals deeper issues that could hinder his campaign.

In a race where every moment counts, Trump's ability to present himself as a coherent and capable candidate is more important than ever. As the debate approaches, all eyes will be on Trump to see if he can rise to the occasion or if the concerns surrounding his mental fitness will prove to be a significant obstacle in his path.",-22.0,16.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,422.0,1.2307692307692308,0.037914691943127965

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio – In a stark illustration of the challenges facing Hillary Clinton's campaign, a door-knocking event scheduled for 1 PM on a recent afternoon attracted only a single attendee, a supporter of her rival, Donald Trump. The event, which was anticipated to draw a significant number of volunteers eager to engage with the community, instead saw only Clinton's staff members present, highlighting potential issues with her ground game as the election season heats up.

The solitary Trump supporter, who arrived to document the event, was eventually asked to leave by Clinton's staff after they recognized his affiliation. This incident not only underscored the lack of enthusiasm for Clinton's campaign in Ohio but also raised questions about the effectiveness of her outreach efforts. With the empty campaign office serving as a backdrop, the event painted a concerning picture of Clinton's ability to mobilize supporters in a critical battleground state.

The low turnout at the door-knocking event has sparked discussions among political analysts regarding Clinton's overall support in other states. Observers are beginning to wonder if the lack of engagement seen in Delaware is indicative of a broader trend that could impact her campaign's viability as the election approaches. The stark contrast between Clinton's sparse gatherings and Donald Trump's packed rallies has led to growing skepticism about her chances in the upcoming election.

Clinton's campaign has invested significant resources into outreach and advertising, yet the results appear to be falling short. The question arises: is the campaign spending translating into tangible support among voters? With the current political landscape favoring Trump, who continues to draw large crowds and enthusiastic supporters, Clinton's campaign may need to reassess its strategies to regain momentum.

As the election draws nearer, the implications of this event could be far-reaching. Political experts suggest that Clinton's campaign must find ways to invigorate her base and attract undecided voters if she hopes to compete effectively against Trump. The empty office in Delaware serves as a stark reminder of the uphill battle she faces in rallying support and energizing her campaign.

In light of these developments, the skepticism surrounding Clinton's campaign is palpable. With Trump’s rallies brimming with supporters, the contrast raises alarms about Clinton's ability to connect with voters and inspire the same level of enthusiasm. The upcoming weeks will be critical for her campaign as it seeks to address these challenges and bolster its ground game.

In conclusion, the door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, has illuminated significant concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's campaign. The lack of attendance, coupled with the presence of a Trump supporter, has led to questions about her support in key states and the effectiveness of her campaign spending. As the election approaches, Clinton's team will need to take decisive action to turn the tide and demonstrate that they can mobilize a robust base of support to compete against Donald Trump. The road ahead is fraught with challenges, and the outcome remains uncertain as both candidates vie for the presidency.",-7.0,35.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,576.0,1.6666666666666667,0.06076388888888889

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a recent bombing in New York City, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his immediate and pointed reactions. Trump, who accurately described the incident as a ""bombing,"" has found himself at the center of a media storm, particularly with CNN's response to his comments.

CNN, in a move that has drawn criticism, took issue with Trump's terminology. The network's criticism is notable given that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also referred to the attack as a bombing. However, CNN chose to edit out Clinton's reference to the incident in their coverage, a decision that has sparked further debate about media bias and the integrity of reporting.

During an interview on Fox and Friends, Trump did not hold back in his condemnation of CNN's actions. He labeled the network as ""disgusting and disgraceful,"" accusing them of dishonesty in their reporting. Trump has long been critical of CNN, often referring to it as the ""Clinton news network,"" a moniker that underscores his belief that the media outlet has a bias in favor of the Democratic Party.

In addition to his criticisms of CNN, Trump took the opportunity to address broader concerns regarding terrorism and national security. He expressed frustration with what he described as ""stupid"" leaders who have adopted a soft approach to terrorism. Trump emphasized the need for a tougher stance, arguing that the current leadership has failed to adequately protect the nation from threats.

A significant part of Trump's commentary focused on the issue of refugees, particularly in light of the ongoing crisis in Syria. He expressed alarm over the Obama administration's plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017, claiming that Clinton's intentions would lead to an even greater influx of refugees into the United States. Trump has consistently argued that the vetting process for incoming refugees is insufficient, raising concerns about the potential risks associated with allowing more individuals into the country without thorough background checks.

The former president's remarks come at a time when the nation is grappling with the implications of immigration and national security. Trump's call for a more stringent vetting process resonates with a segment of the population that prioritizes safety and security in the face of global terrorism. His comments have reignited discussions about the balance between humanitarian efforts and national security, a topic that remains contentious in American political discourse.

As the situation continues to unfold, Trump's criticisms of both CNN and the current approach to terrorism and refugee acceptance are likely to remain in the spotlight. His ability to galvanize support around these issues reflects a broader sentiment among many Americans who are concerned about the implications of immigration policies and the effectiveness of current leadership in addressing the threat of terrorism.

In summary, Trump's immediate reaction to the New York City bombing has not only highlighted his stance on terrorism and refugee policies but has also reignited debates about media integrity and bias. As the former president continues to voice his opinions, the implications of his statements will likely resonate in the ongoing discussions surrounding national security and immigration in the United States.",-45.0,-8.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,600.0,-0.38095238095238093,-0.013333333333333334

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

In a surprising turn of events, Ahmad Rahami, a convicted terrorist and murderer, has filed a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The lawsuit, which has garnered attention due to Rahami's notorious background, alleges that his family has faced discrimination based on their Afghan Muslim culture.

Rahami's family has operated a chicken restaurant in Elizabeth since 2002, a business that has been a staple in the community for over two decades. However, the family claims that their experience as business owners has been marred by harassment from local officials. They allege that they have received numerous unjust tickets and court summons, which they believe are rooted in bias against their cultural background.

The lawsuit details instances of racial abuse directed at the Rahami family from local residents, including derogatory comments about Muslims. This alleged harassment has contributed to a hostile environment for the family, who assert that they have been unfairly targeted by both the community and local law enforcement.

Filed in federal court in Newark, the lawsuit specifically claims that the Elizabeth police department violated the family's constitutional rights. The Rahami family contends that they were singled out for staying open past 10 PM, despite having the necessary permissions to do so. This claim raises questions about the treatment of minority-owned businesses in the area and the extent to which cultural biases may influence law enforcement actions.

The police department reportedly cited high crime rates in the area as justification for their actions against the Rahami family. However, the family argues that this rationale is unfounded and serves as a pretext for discrimination. They maintain that their restaurant has been a legitimate business and that the police's attempts to force them to close early are unwarranted.

The lawsuit is particularly ironic given Ahmad Rahami's subsequent criminal activities. Five years after the alleged discrimination, he was arrested for planting bombs in the Tri-state area, an act that has further complicated the narrative surrounding his family's claims. The juxtaposition of his heinous actions with the allegations of discrimination raises questions about the broader implications of his lawsuit.

As the case unfolds in federal court, it will likely draw attention not only for its connection to a high-profile criminal but also for its exploration of issues related to discrimination, cultural bias, and the treatment of minority communities by law enforcement. The outcome of this lawsuit could have significant ramifications for the Rahami family and the local community in Elizabeth, as well as for the ongoing discourse surrounding civil rights and policing practices in America.",-49.0,-54.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,486.0,-3.0,-0.1111111111111111
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Allegations of pay-to-play corruption have emerged involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the organization's financial practices and its true charitable impact. The Clinton campaign has initially responded to these allegations by emphasizing the foundation's charitable work, but critics argue that the foundation primarily functions as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates.

In 2014, the Clinton Foundation's financial disclosures revealed troubling statistics regarding its charitable contributions. According to IRS filings, only 5.7% of the foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants. This figure has drawn scrutiny, particularly in light of the foundation's total spending, which reached nearly $91.3 million that year. Of this amount, less than $5.2 million was directed toward charity, raising concerns about the foundation's commitment to its stated mission.

The financial breakdown of the foundation's expenditures in 2014 further highlights the disparity between its charitable intentions and actual spending. A significant portion of the budget—$34.8 million—was spent on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits. Additionally, $50.4 million was categorized as ""other expenses,"" which has led critics to question the foundation's operational priorities.

Notably, charitable spending saw a dramatic decrease of 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite the foundation receiving an additional $30 million in revenue. This decline in charitable contributions, coupled with a $5 million increase in salaries and other expenses, has fueled allegations that the foundation is more focused on enriching the Clintons than on philanthropic efforts.

The implications of these findings suggest that the Clinton Foundation may have been utilized as a means for the Clintons to generate wealth. Critics have pointed to Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, alleging that she leveraged her position for financial gain, further complicating the narrative surrounding the foundation's operations.

As the allegations of pay-to-play corruption continue to unfold, the Clinton Foundation's financial practices remain under intense scrutiny. The foundation's ability to maintain its charitable image while facing these serious accusations will be a critical factor in the ongoing discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton and her family's legacy. The revelations about the foundation's spending patterns raise significant questions about the intersection of politics and philanthropy, and whether the foundation has truly served its intended purpose.",25.0,5.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,437.0,0.3125,0.011441647597254004

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York, former President Barack Obama has left many Americans in shock, as his remarks have drawn sharp criticism for their perceived insensitivity in the wake of recent violent events. The speech, which took place shortly after a weekend marked by bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing incident in St. Cloud, Minnesota, has been labeled by some as a display of arrogance and ineffectiveness.

The weekend's violence, which included multiple bombings and a brutal stabbing, has raised serious concerns about safety and security in the United States. However, instead of addressing these pressing issues, Obama chose to focus his speech on a high-dollar fundraiser, where he criticized sexism in the media and expressed his support for Hillary Clinton. This decision has left many feeling that he neglected the victims of the attacks and the gravity of the situation at hand.

Critics of the former president have been vocal in their disapproval, labeling him as ""useless"" in the face of such tragedies. The author of this article echoes these sentiments, expressing disappointment that elected officials, including Obama, did not take the opportunity to address the acts of terrorism that occurred over the weekend. The lack of immediate acknowledgment of the bombings and the stabbing has been seen as a failure to connect with the American public during a time of crisis.

While some have argued that Obama may not have had sufficient information to comment on the bombings during his speech, the author contends that a brief acknowledgment of the victims and the violence would have been appropriate. The expectation for leaders to respond to acts of terror is not only a matter of protocol but also a reflection of empathy and solidarity with those affected. The author finds Obama's response to be ""disgusting,"" highlighting a disconnect between the former president's priorities and the urgent needs of the nation.

The juxtaposition of Obama's focus on fundraising and social issues against the backdrop of violence has raised questions about the responsibilities of public figures in times of crisis. Many Americans look to their leaders for guidance and reassurance, especially when faced with acts of terror that threaten their safety. The decision to prioritize a political agenda over addressing the immediate concerns of the public has left a bitter taste in the mouths of those who feel that their leaders should be more attuned to the realities of the world around them.

As the nation grapples with the implications of the recent violence, the call for accountability among elected officials grows louder. The expectation is not merely for words of comfort but for a genuine acknowledgment of the pain and suffering experienced by victims and their families. In this context, Obama's speech has been perceived as a missed opportunity to unite the country in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, Obama's recent speech in New York has sparked outrage and disappointment among many Americans. The decision to focus on fundraising and social issues, while neglecting to address the recent acts of terrorism, has led to accusations of arrogance and ineffectiveness. As the nation continues to process the violence of the weekend, the need for leaders to respond with empathy and urgency remains paramount. The hope is that future responses will reflect a deeper understanding of the challenges facing the country and a commitment to standing with those who have been affected by such tragedies.",-25.0,-79.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,643.0,-3.590909090909091,-0.12286158631415241
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

Recent developments have heightened public awareness of potential corruption at the Clinton Foundation, particularly since Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A new report has surfaced, indicating that the foundation is grappling with more serious issues than previously understood.

The Daily Caller has reported alarming findings regarding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a prominent arm of the Clinton Foundation. According to the report, CHAI distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa, raising significant concerns about the efficacy of these treatments. A draft congressional report suggests that this practice ""likely increased"" the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these drugs for their health.

As one of the foundation's most significant initiatives, CHAI's actions are now under intense scrutiny, particularly as Hillary Clinton gears up for her presidential campaign. The distribution of diluted medications could lead to increased public and media examination of the Clinton charity's practices and accountability.

Further complicating matters, the congressional study has unveiled troubling connections between Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-American figures who are currently under investigation by the FDA and SEC. The report specifically highlights the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company notorious for its history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

While the report raises serious questions about the integrity of the foundation's operations, the extent of how many AIDS patients received the ""watered-down"" drugs remains unclear. This uncertainty adds to the urgency of the situation, as advocates call for immediate action.

In light of these revelations, there are growing calls for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent further harm to vulnerable populations. As the situation unfolds, the implications for the foundation and its initiatives could have lasting effects on public trust and the political landscape.",-14.0,-10.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,350.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02857142857142857
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for enacting poorly worded laws that have significant implications for parenting activities. A particular law, designed to protect children from molesters, has raised alarm among legal experts and parents alike due to its vague language, which criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals. This broad definition has the potential to turn innocent parental actions, such as diaper changes and baths, into felonies.

Critics argue that while the intention behind the law is to safeguard children, it fails to account for the everyday activities that parents engage in with their children. The law's lack of clarity has left many parents feeling vulnerable, as they could inadvertently find themselves facing serious legal consequences for actions that are both normal and necessary in child-rearing.

The situation has been further complicated by a recent ruling from the Arizona Supreme Court, which determined that defendants in such cases must prove a lack of sexual intent. This ruling has raised significant concerns about the presumption of innocence, a cornerstone of the American legal system. Legal experts warn that this shift places an undue burden on defendants, particularly parents who may be accused under the law.

In a controversial move, the court suggested that the solution lies in trusting prosecutors to exercise common sense rather than revising the problematic law. This recommendation has been met with skepticism, as many believe it places too much power in the hands of prosecutors, who may not always act in the best interest of justice.

John Pfaff, a legal expert, has highlighted the troubling implications of plea bargaining in this context. He notes that defendants may feel pressured to accept plea deals due to the threat of severe charges, even if they are innocent. This dynamic raises serious questions about the fairness of the legal process and the potential for coercion, particularly for parents who may be caught in a legal quagmire.

The ruling has also opened the door for prosecutors to leverage child molestation laws as a means of coercing parents into accepting plea deals. This practice could infringe upon constitutional rights, as individuals may be forced to navigate a legal landscape that seems to prioritize expediency over justice.

As concerns mount, many are calling for a reevaluation of the law to ensure that it protects children without compromising the rights of parents and caregivers. The lack of intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court has left Arizona's parents feeling as though their due process rights are being suspended, with no clear path to resolution.

In light of these developments, the Arizona state legislature faces increasing pressure to address the flaws in the law and to consider the implications of their legislative choices on the lives of families across the state. The ongoing debate highlights the delicate balance between protecting children and ensuring that innocent parents are not unjustly criminalized for fulfilling their parental duties. As the situation unfolds, the eyes of the nation remain on Arizona, where the intersection of law and parenting continues to spark controversy and concern.",-12.0,-11.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,567.0,-0.55,-0.019400352733686066
Fake_73-Webpage,Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?,"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

× 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts with the possibility of Hillary Clinton assuming the presidency, speculation is rife regarding the future of Michelle Obama. The former First Lady, who has become a prominent figure in American culture, may find herself back in the White House, albeit under a different administration. This prospect raises questions and concerns, particularly regarding the legacy of Michelle Obama and her potential qualifications for a role in a Clinton-led government.

The idea of covering the Obamas for another four years is met with discomfort by some observers. The couple has been a focal point of American politics and culture for nearly a decade, and the thought of their continued prominence can be overwhelming. The author expresses a sense of fatigue at the prospect of revisiting the narratives surrounding the Obamas, particularly as they relate to Michelle’s initiatives and public statements.

Criticism of Michelle Obama’s legacy is not uncommon. Her school lunch program, which aimed to provide healthier meal options for children, has faced scrutiny from various quarters. Detractors argue that the program has not achieved its intended goals and has even led to unintended consequences, such as increased food waste in schools. Additionally, some of Michelle Obama’s statements during her time in the public eye have sparked controversy, leading to further debate about her effectiveness as a public figure.

As discussions about a potential role for Michelle Obama in a Clinton administration arise, questions about her qualifications come to the forefront. While she has been an influential advocate for healthy living and education, critics wonder whether her experience is sufficient for a significant governmental position. The author raises valid concerns about whether her celebrity status and advocacy work translate into the necessary skills for effective governance.

Hillary Clinton’s belief in government involvement in child-rearing adds another layer to this discussion. Clinton has long championed the idea that the government should play a role in supporting families and children, a stance that aligns with some of Michelle Obama’s initiatives. However, this perspective has its critics, who argue that such involvement can lead to overreach and a dilution of parental responsibility. The author expresses discomfort with the notion of government acting as a parental figure, suggesting that this approach may undermine the traditional family structure.

Despite the criticisms and concerns, Michelle Obama remains steadfast in her commitment to her healthy living campaign for children. She has publicly stated that she has no plans to slow down her efforts, indicating a desire to continue advocating for healthier lifestyles and better nutrition for the nation’s youth. This dedication to her cause may resonate with some segments of the population, particularly those who prioritize health and wellness in their communities.

However, the progressive influence on education and child upbringing continues to be a contentious issue. Many parents and educators are wary of the implications of government-led initiatives in these areas, fearing that they may not align with their values or the needs of their children. The author’s discomfort with the idea of government intervention in parenting reflects a broader concern among citizens who value personal responsibility and autonomy in raising their children.

As the political climate evolves, the potential for Michelle Obama to play a role in a Clinton administration remains uncertain. While her commitment to health and wellness is commendable, the questions surrounding her qualifications and the implications of government involvement in child-rearing will likely continue to fuel debate. As the nation watches closely, the future of the Obamas in American politics remains a topic of both intrigue and concern.",6.0,10.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,671.0,0.38461538461538464,0.014903129657228018

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has emerged involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), with allegations surfacing that the organization distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This troubling revelation has raised serious concerns about the quality of healthcare provided to some of the most vulnerable populations in the world.

The controversy is closely linked to Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has a notorious history in the pharmaceutical industry. In 2013, Ranbaxy was found guilty of fraud and introducing adulterated drugs into commerce, resulting in a staggering $500 million fine. This past misconduct has now resurfaced, casting a shadow over the Clinton Foundation's ongoing relationship with the company.

A draft congressional report, initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, has brought to light the potential dangers associated with the distribution of these substandard drugs. The report suggests that the use of ineffective medications may have significantly increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these treatments. The implications of this finding are dire, as it raises questions about the safety and efficacy of the drugs provided to those battling HIV/AIDS in the region.

Dinesh Thakur, a former employee of Ranbaxy, has emerged as a key whistleblower in this scandal. His revelations led to a significant lawsuit against the company, exposing the extent of the fraudulent practices that had been taking place. Thakur's courage in coming forward has shed light on the potential consequences of distributing ineffective drugs, prompting further scrutiny of the pharmaceutical giant's operations.

As the investigation unfolds, concerns have been raised about the number of lives that may have been lost due to the distribution of these ineffective medications. Patients who were promised effective treatment may have instead received substandard drugs, leading to devastating health outcomes. The emotional toll on families and communities affected by this scandal cannot be overstated, as the false promises made to patients have resulted in a profound sense of betrayal.

Critics have directed their ire at the Clinton Foundation for its continued partnership with Ranbaxy, despite the company's documented history of poor quality control and fraudulent practices. The foundation's decision to maintain this relationship has sparked outrage among advocates for patient safety and healthcare transparency. Many are questioning the ethical implications of prioritizing financial partnerships over the well-being of individuals in need of life-saving treatments.

In 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, further complicating the narrative surrounding the distribution of substandard medicines. This funding raises critical questions about the oversight and accountability of organizations involved in providing healthcare to vulnerable populations. The potential impact of these substandard medicines on patient health is a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.

The allegations against CHAI and Ranbaxy have ignited a broader conversation about the responsibilities of charitable organizations in ensuring the safety and efficacy of the medications they distribute. As the scandal continues to unfold, many are calling for greater transparency and accountability in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly when it comes to the health of individuals in low-income regions.

The Clinton Foundation, which has long positioned itself as a champion of global health initiatives, now faces intense scrutiny over its practices and partnerships. Critics argue that the foundation's actions suggest a troubling prioritization of financial gain over the well-being of individuals, particularly in the context of its charitable initiatives. The implications of this scandal extend beyond the immediate concerns of drug quality; they raise fundamental questions about the ethics of philanthropy in the healthcare sector.

As the congressional report gains traction, it is likely that further investigations will be launched to examine the extent of the issues surrounding the distribution of substandard HIV/AIDS drugs. The potential ramifications for the Clinton Foundation and its partners could be significant, as public trust in charitable organizations hangs in the balance.

In conclusion, the allegations against the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its association with Ranbaxy have unveiled a troubling scandal that raises serious questions about the safety and efficacy of HIV/AIDS treatments in sub-Saharan Africa. As the investigation continues, the focus will remain on the impact of these substandard drugs on patient health and the ethical responsibilities of organizations involved in global health initiatives. The lives of countless individuals depend on the outcomes of this inquiry, making it imperative that the truth is uncovered and accountability is enforced.",-63.0,-47.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,810.0,-1.5666666666666667,-0.05802469135802469

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated the State Department to release documents related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her aides' completion of mandatory security training within a five-day timeframe. The decision comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which has been seeking transparency regarding the handling of classified materials by Clinton and her team.

Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, ruled in favor of TheDCNF, rejecting the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. This ruling underscores the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Clinton's tenure at the State Department, particularly concerning the protocols for managing classified information.

TheDCNF's request specifically targets records pertaining to Clinton, her Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The organization has been pressing for documentation that would confirm whether Clinton and her aides completed the necessary security briefings that are mandated for individuals handling classified materials.

In his ruling, Judge Leon expressed clear frustration with the State Department's delays in producing the requested records. He ordered that one third of the approximately 400 documents be released by September 26, with the remaining documents due by October 10. This timeline reflects the judge's determination to expedite the process and ensure compliance with the FOIA request.

Attorney Bradley Moss, who has been following the case, noted the judge's evident frustration with what he described as the State Department's obstruction of the FOIA process. Moss warned that continued non-compliance could lead to serious consequences for the agency, emphasizing the importance of transparency in government operations.

The State Department's handling of the situation has come under scrutiny, particularly following a response from officials on July 29, which indicated that the requested documents had not been produced. This response raised concerns that Clinton and her aides may not have completed the required security training courses, a revelation that could have significant implications for the ongoing discussions about the management of classified information within the government.

The ruling and the subsequent order for document release mark a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate surrounding accountability and transparency in government operations. As the deadline for the release of documents approaches, all eyes will be on the State Department to see if it complies with the court's order and what the released documents may reveal about the security training of one of the most prominent figures in American politics.

The implications of this ruling extend beyond just the immediate case at hand. It highlights the broader issues of government transparency and the public's right to access information regarding the actions of its officials. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for future FOIA requests and the government's obligation to provide timely and complete responses.

As the situation develops, it remains to be seen how the State Department will respond to the court's order and what the released documents will disclose about the security protocols followed by Clinton and her aides during her time as Secretary of State. The public and media alike are poised to scrutinize the findings, which could further influence the narrative surrounding Clinton's handling of classified information and the broader implications for national security.

In conclusion, the federal judge's ruling represents a significant step towards greater accountability within the government. The upcoming release of documents will not only shed light on the actions of Hillary Clinton and her aides but also serve as a reminder of the importance of transparency in maintaining public trust in government institutions. As the deadline approaches, the anticipation surrounding the case continues to grow, with many eager to see the outcome of this pivotal legal battle.",-5.0,7.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,698.0,0.30434782608695654,0.01002865329512894
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton approaches, questions are being raised about the role of moderators and the absence of fact-checking during the event. NBC News has hinted that moderator Lester Holt will not engage in fact-checking candidates, a decision that could significantly impact the debate's integrity and the accountability of the candidates.

This lack of real-time verification allows Trump to make unverified claims without immediate challenge, placing the onus of accountability primarily on Clinton. Major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, have also announced that they will not provide on-screen fact checks during the debate, further complicating the landscape for viewers seeking accurate information.

The absence of a fact-checking mechanism raises concerns about the potential for misleading statements to go unchecked. Politico's analysis reveals that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, underscoring the critical need for a robust fact-checking process during such high-stakes discussions. Without this, the risk of inaccurate statements being accepted as truth increases, potentially skewing public perception.

Clinton's campaign has voiced strong concerns regarding the debate format, emphasizing the importance of the moderator's role in challenging falsehoods. They argue that a fair debate hinges on the ability to confront inaccuracies head-on, ensuring that voters receive a clear and truthful representation of each candidate's positions. The expectation is that Clinton must perform exceptionally well to counter Trump's unverified claims, a pressure that many see as disproportionate.

This situation has led to a perception of a double standard in the treatment of the candidates. While Trump may be allowed to make unfounded assertions without immediate scrutiny, Clinton is expected to exceed expectations and effectively rebut these claims. This dynamic raises questions about the fairness of the debate and the broader implications for electoral discourse.

As the debate nears, concerns about the state of journalism and its role in political accountability are becoming increasingly pronounced. The decision to forgo fact-checking during such a pivotal event reflects a troubling trend in media coverage, where the emphasis on entertainment and spectacle may overshadow the fundamental responsibility of informing the public.

In a political climate where misinformation can spread rapidly, the absence of fact-checking during the Trump-Clinton debate could hinder the exposure of inaccuracies and misrepresentations. As voters prepare to tune in, the hope remains that the debate will foster a meaningful exchange of ideas, despite the challenges posed by the current media landscape.",-6.0,2.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,456.0,0.11764705882352941,0.0043859649122807015
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

In a striking revelation, Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has voiced serious concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In her recent statements, Kyle claims that Clinton is driven by ""anger and rage,"" which she believes could lead to a physical breakdown. 

Kyle's assertions extend beyond mere emotional observations; she contends that Clinton is experiencing cognitive impairment, raising alarms about her overall fitness for the demanding role of president. According to Kyle, symptoms such as emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty with tasks are indicative of a deeper issue that could hinder Clinton's ability to lead effectively.

Moreover, Kyle warns that Clinton's paranoia and controlling nature could culminate in what she describes as a ""psychological disaster."" This stark warning underscores the potential ramifications of Clinton's mental state on her presidential aspirations and the broader implications for the Democratic Party.

In an effort to shed light on these concerns, Kyle authored a book titled ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" where she aims to reveal the truth about Clinton, including her health issues. The book serves as a platform for Kyle to articulate her views and provide insight into what she perceives as a troubling trajectory for Clinton's political career.

Kyle's claims paint a picture of Clinton as someone who is ""addicted to power,"" suggesting that her ambitions may overshadow her well-being and the interests of the Democratic Party. This characterization raises questions about the lengths to which Clinton might go to achieve her goals, potentially at the expense of her health and the party's integrity.

These revelations come at a time when Clinton is already grappling with challenges to her public image, particularly amid ongoing health and character scandals. The mounting concerns voiced by Kyle add another layer of complexity to Clinton's political narrative, as she seeks to navigate the turbulent waters of public perception and political ambition.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Kyle's statements could resonate with voters and party members alike, prompting a reevaluation of Clinton's candidacy. With the 2024 election on the horizon, the scrutiny surrounding Clinton's fitness for office is likely to intensify, making Kyle's revelations a focal point in the ongoing discourse about the former Secretary of State's future in politics.",-13.0,-11.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,448.0,-0.7857142857142857,-0.024553571428571428

FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE.

FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In a continent often celebrated as a ""nation of immigrants"" and a ""melting pot,"" the conversation surrounding cultural integration and unity has taken center stage. As communities across North America grapple with the complexities of immigration, a growing sentiment emphasizes the need for newcomers to adapt to the customs and traditions of their new homes rather than maintaining their own ways of life.

A recent statement from a Quebec mayor has reignited this debate, particularly regarding the integration of Muslim immigrants into Canadian society. The mayor asserted that those who choose to emigrate to Canada must embrace Canadian culture, underscoring that the decision to leave one's homeland comes with the responsibility to assimilate. This perspective reflects a broader concern that, while Canada is known for its acceptance of diverse backgrounds, the preservation of Canadian identity and culture—rooted in Judeo-Christian values—should remain a priority.

The mayor's comments were not without controversy. He emphasized that Canadians are not inherently racist or xenophobic, pointing out the nation's history of welcoming immigrants from various cultures. However, he firmly stated that the municipality of Dorval reserves the right to refuse concessions to Islamic practices and Sharia law, reinforcing the idea that local customs should take precedence over foreign traditions.

This sentiment resonates with many who feel frustrated by what they perceive as the imposition of foreign customs on American law and culture. In Texas, for instance, legislative measures have been enacted to prevent the implementation of Sharia law within the state's judicial system. Such actions reflect a growing concern among some Americans that the core values of their society are at risk of being overshadowed by external influences.

The mayor's remarks also included a provocative suggestion for Muslims who may feel uncomfortable with Canadian culture: they have the option to return to one of the 57 Muslim-majority countries. This statement has sparked debate about the balance between cultural acceptance and the expectation of integration. Critics argue that such comments can foster division rather than unity, while supporters contend that they highlight the importance of shared values in a cohesive society.

The overarching message from these discussions is clear: immigrants are encouraged to either adopt the local culture or refrain from imposing their own. This call for cultural integration is not merely about conformity; it is about fostering a sense of belonging and unity within diverse communities. As North America continues to evolve as a multicultural society, the challenge remains to find common ground that respects individual backgrounds while promoting a shared identity.

In conclusion, the dialogue surrounding immigration and cultural integration is complex and multifaceted. As leaders and communities navigate these issues, the emphasis on unity and the preservation of local customs will likely remain at the forefront of the conversation.

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a tense incident in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through a demonstration. Eyewitnesses initially feared for the man's safety, speculating that he might be the target of a mugging. However, the situation took an unexpected turn when the protesters allowed him to pass without incident.

As the man attempted to navigate through the crowd, he displayed a handgun out of his car window. This action prompted the protesters to disperse, effectively resolving the situation without any physical confrontation. The man’s decision to brandish the weapon raised questions about the appropriateness of his response in such a charged environment.

While some may argue that the display of the firearm was a necessary measure to ensure his safety, others contend that it could have escalated tensions further. The incident highlights the complexities of interactions between individuals and protest movements, particularly in a climate where emotions run high and misunderstandings can easily occur.

Critics of the man's actions may suggest that he could have chosen a different approach, such as simply driving through the crowd without displaying a weapon. This alternative might have avoided the potential for conflict and maintained a more peaceful atmosphere. The incident serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between personal safety and the need for respectful engagement during protests.

As discussions surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement continue to evolve, this encounter raises important questions about the responsibilities of individuals in such situations. The man’s choice to display a firearm has sparked debate about the appropriateness of using weapons as a means of self-defense in the face of perceived threats.

Ultimately, the incident underscores the need for dialogue and understanding in the midst of social movements. As communities grapple with issues of race, justice, and safety, the actions of individuals can have far-reaching implications, shaping perceptions and responses to ongoing societal challenges.",-18.0,-10.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,365.0,-0.6666666666666666,-0.0273972602739726
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago's environmentalists are under fire for what critics describe as blatant hypocrisy regarding their support for development projects. The recent backing of the Obama Presidential Center by local environmental groups has raised eyebrows, especially given their previous opposition to George Lucas's proposed museum.

In a striking contrast, the same environmentalists who blocked Lucas's project—citing concerns over environmental impact—are now expressing enthusiasm for the Obama center, which will necessitate the destruction of trees and grass in Jackson Park. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly voiced her excitement about the new center, a stance that many see as contradictory to the principles outlined in the environmentalists' own charter.

Critics argue that this shift in support highlights a troubling pattern among Leftists, who appear to champion environmental issues until they are personally affected. The proposed Lucas museum, which would have been constructed on a parking lot, was deemed unacceptable, while the Obama center's impact on green space seems to be overlooked.

This situation has sparked discussions about a potential racial double standard in environmental decision-making. The contrasting treatment of the two projects raises questions about the motivations behind the environmentalists' actions and whether they are prioritizing certain developments over others based on their perceived value or the individuals involved.

As the debate continues, the actions of Chicago's environmentalists serve as a reminder of the complexities and contradictions that often accompany urban development and environmental advocacy. The community is left to ponder whether these decisions reflect genuine environmental concern or a selective approach to activism.",3.0,-6.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,297.0,-0.6,-0.020202020202020204

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

In a dramatic turn of events, General Stanley McChrystal, the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has resigned following a tense meeting with President Barack Obama. The two leaders have had a history of frequent disagreements regarding the conduct of the war, which culminated in this pivotal moment.

Anticipating the end of his Army career, McChrystal was called into the Oval Office for what many believed would be a decisive conversation. During the meeting, President Obama accused the General of failing to support him politically. In a firm response, McChrystal clarified that his duty was to support Obama as Commander-in-Chief, not as a politician. This assertion led him to hand in his resignation, marking a significant shift in military leadership.

The relationship between Obama and the military has been fraught with tension, with the President reportedly harboring negative sentiments towards military personnel. As McChrystal resigned, Obama made a dismissive remark, suggesting that he would be happy to disrespect the General after his death. In a display of honor and integrity, McChrystal saluted and replied that he would not stand in line to disrespect anyone, underscoring his commitment to the values of the military.

This resignation not only highlights the ongoing challenges within the US military leadership but also raises questions about the future of military strategy in Afghanistan under the Obama administration. As the nation watches closely, the implications of this departure will undoubtedly resonate throughout the military and political landscape.",7.0,-1.0,294.0,0.4666666666666667,0.023809523809523808,279.0,-0.09090909090909091,-0.0035842293906810036

Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm.

Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

In a troubling turn of events, recent riots in Charlotte, North Carolina, have raised significant concerns about the origins and motivations of those involved. Reports indicate that at least 70% of the rioters were from out of state, a statistic that has led to speculation about the nature of the unrest and the individuals behind it. 

Evidence suggests that many of the rioters possessed out-of-state identification, pointing to a potentially organized operation rather than a spontaneous outburst of local discontent. The head of the police union in Charlotte has characterized these individuals as ""professional criminals,"" implying that their presence was not merely coincidental but rather a calculated effort to incite chaos in the city.

The unrest in Charlotte has drawn attention to broader claims that outside radicals are being utilized to escalate tensions during protests. This narrative raises questions about the motivations behind such actions and whether they are aimed at undermining the legitimacy of local movements advocating for social justice. The situation in Charlotte stands in stark contrast to protests in other cities, such as Tulsa, where demonstrations have remained peaceful. Observers note that the difference in outcomes may be attributed to local sentiment and the fact that the police officer involved in a recent incident was charged with manslaughter, fostering a more constructive dialogue between the community and law enforcement.

Charlotte's environment appears to be more sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement, which may have made it a target for unrest. The city's history of activism and its ongoing struggles with issues of racial inequality could have contributed to its selection as a focal point for those seeking to promote a revolutionary agenda. The implications of this unrest suggest a deliberate effort to create chaos, potentially undermining the very causes that many protesters seek to advance.

As the situation continues to unfold, the involvement of out-of-state individuals raises critical questions about the nature of protests and the influence of external forces. The characterization of the rioters as ""professional criminals"" by local law enforcement adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, suggesting that the unrest may be part of a larger strategy to disrupt communities that are actively engaging in conversations about racial justice and police reform.

The contrasting experiences of cities like Charlotte and Tulsa highlight the varying dynamics at play in protests across the nation. While some communities are able to engage in peaceful demonstrations, others find themselves grappling with violence and chaos, often fueled by individuals who do not share the same local concerns or objectives. This disparity underscores the importance of understanding the motivations behind protests and the potential for outside influences to shape the narrative.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of the riots, the community faces the challenge of addressing the underlying issues that sparked the unrest while also navigating the complexities introduced by external actors. The situation serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between advocating for change and the potential for that advocacy to be co-opted by those with different agendas.

In conclusion, the riots in Charlotte, marked by the significant presence of out-of-state individuals, raise important questions about the nature of protests and the influence of external forces. As communities across the nation continue to engage in discussions about social justice, the events in Charlotte serve as a cautionary tale about the potential for chaos to overshadow the voices of those genuinely seeking change. The ongoing dialogue surrounding these issues will be crucial in shaping the future of activism and community engagement in the face of adversity.",-17.0,-28.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,655.0,-1.3333333333333333,-0.042748091603053436
Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

As the Presidential campaign heats up, Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a significant issue, capturing the attention of both supporters and critics alike. Once dismissed as mere conspiracy theories, concerns regarding her well-being are now being taken seriously by the public, especially following her collapse on September 11th. Even media outlets that have traditionally supported Clinton can no longer overlook the implications of her health problems.

Adding to the intrigue, expert Clif Hite has put forth a controversial theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and is currently being replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this claim would represent one of the most significant cover-ups in American political history.

Compounding the situation, reports have surfaced alleging that Russian intelligence claims Clinton never left her daughter Chelsea's apartment and is utilizing doubles to maintain her public presence. Furthermore, there are allegations of a secret plane crash that purportedly injured Clinton, with some sources finding this report credible.

As speculation continues to swirl, the article invites readers to weigh in on the matter. Do you believe that Hillary Clinton was injured or killed in a crash and subsequently replaced by CGI?

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right?

In a political landscape increasingly defined by opposition to former President Donald Trump, a new organization has emerged that is drawing attention for its funding and mission. Common Defense PAC, identified as one of the many groups opposing Trump, has been linked to George Soros, a figure often at the center of political funding controversies. Discover the Networks has reported that Soros funds 187 groups that are actively working against Trump, and Common Defense PAC is among them.

Common Defense PAC positions itself as an advocate for the rights of all Americans while simultaneously standing firmly against Trump. The organization claims to represent the interests of military veterans, as evidenced by the leadership page on its website, which features individuals with military backgrounds. However, the page notably lacks contact information for these veterans, raising questions about the transparency and authenticity of the organization’s claims.

The PAC has been proactive in its anti-Trump messaging, sharing content that criticizes the former president and collaborating with other political action committees (PACs) funded by Soros. One of the prominent hashtags associated with their campaign is #VetsAgainstTrump, which has gained traction not only through Common Defense PAC but also through MoveOn.org, a well-known progressive organization. MoveOn.org's Political Action has actively promoted the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag, amplifying the message across various platforms.

In a bid to further their cause, Common Defense PAC has launched a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump. This initiative has reportedly reached over 4.5 million people, showcasing the PAC's ability to mobilize support against Trump. The campaign has garnered endorsements from celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Van Jones, with MoveOn.org serving as the organizer of the effort. This collaboration highlights the intersection of celebrity influence and political activism in the current climate.

In addition to online campaigns, Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org have taken to the streets, organizing protests that call on prominent Republican figures, such as Senator John McCain, to disavow Trump. These actions reflect a broader strategy to leverage public demonstrations as a means of exerting pressure on political leaders.

Despite its ambitious agenda, Common Defense PAC has faced scrutiny regarding its funding and leadership. A recent filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) revealed that the PAC has received contributions from only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who donated $20,000. This raises concerns about the financial backing of the organization and its ability to sustain its operations in the long term.

At the helm of Common Defense PAC is Perry O’Brien, the PAC's Director, who is described as a left-wing activist and a conscientious objector from the Iraq War. O’Brien's background as a conscientious objector has sparked debate about the representation of veterans within the organization. Critics argue that having a single conscientious objector leading the PAC may not adequately reflect the diverse views and experiences of all veterans, particularly those who may support Trump.

O’Brien's history of organizing efforts against Trump and his connections to MoveOn.org further complicate the narrative surrounding Common Defense PAC. While the organization claims to advocate for veterans, the leadership and funding structure raises questions about its true representation of the veteran community.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Common Defense PAC is poised to play a significant role in the ongoing opposition to Trump. With its Soros funding, celebrity endorsements, and strategic campaigns, the PAC is leveraging various tools to amplify its message. However, the criticisms regarding its leadership and funding may challenge its credibility and effectiveness in rallying support among veterans and the broader public.

In conclusion, Common Defense PAC represents a new chapter in the anti-Trump movement, backed by significant financial resources and a network of progressive allies. As it navigates the complexities of political activism, the organization will need to address the concerns raised about its representation and transparency to solidify its position in the contentious political arena.",8.0,24.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,741.0,0.8571428571428571,0.032388663967611336

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has brought to light a controversial decision made by the Obama administration to allocate $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas. This story, which first emerged in 2015, has resurfaced and continues to provoke significant outrage among various groups, raising questions about the implications of such funding on U.S. foreign policy and domestic priorities.

Critics of the funding argue that it inadvertently supports Islamic terrorists and raises serious concerns about the nature of U.S. foreign aid. They contend that taxpayer dollars should not be used to support potentially terror-supporting groups, especially at a time when the United States is grappling with its own economic challenges. High unemployment rates and other pressing domestic issues have led many to question the wisdom of investing in foreign religious buildings rather than addressing the needs of American citizens.

The State Department has defended the funding, asserting that it is part of a broader strategy to combat Islamic extremism. Officials claim that by building relationships with Islamic leaders through these renovations, the U.S. can foster a more stable and peaceful environment in regions where extremism is prevalent. However, this rationale has not quelled the criticism. Opponents argue that the government is effectively redistributing wealth to Islamist groups, which they believe undermines American interests and values.

Furthermore, the controversy extends beyond the financial implications. Critics have raised alarms about the potential impact of such funding on U.S. demographics, particularly in light of the ongoing resettlement of Muslim refugees. They argue that these policies could alter the cultural landscape of the nation and pose a threat to American sovereignty and security. The fear is that by prioritizing foreign religious institutions, the government is neglecting the needs and concerns of its own citizens.

The CBS investigation has reignited discussions about the role of foreign aid and the responsibilities of the U.S. government in managing taxpayer money. Advocates for taxpayers express frustration over the allocation of funds to overseas projects when many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. They argue that the government should focus on domestic issues rather than investing in foreign religious structures, especially when the implications of such funding are so contentious.

As the debate continues, the story serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding U.S. foreign aid and the challenges of balancing international relations with domestic priorities. The allocation of $770 million for mosque renovations has become a flashpoint for discussions about national security, economic responsibility, and the role of government in addressing the needs of its citizens.

In conclusion, the funding for mosque renovations by the Obama administration has sparked a significant backlash, with critics voicing concerns about its implications for U.S. foreign policy and domestic welfare. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how this issue will influence future discussions about foreign aid and the priorities of the U.S. government in an increasingly complex global landscape. The ongoing outrage reflects a broader sentiment among many Americans who feel that their government should prioritize domestic needs over foreign expenditures, particularly in times of economic uncertainty.",-13.0,-26.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,571.0,-1.2380952380952381,-0.04553415061295972

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

In a bold move to counteract the fear propagated by terrorist organizations like ISIS, the United States Marine Corps has launched a series of billboards across the nation. These billboards serve as a powerful statement of the Marines' readiness to confront terrorism head-on, particularly in light of a recent uptick in terrorist attacks within the U.S.

Terrorist groups, including ISIS, have long utilized fear and propaganda as tools to intimidate individuals into submission. By targeting non-believers and branding them as infidels, these groups threaten violence and death, aiming to instill a sense of dread in the populace. However, the Marines are unbothered by being placed on terrorist hit lists. Instead, they embrace the challenge, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to protect the nation and its citizens.

The timing of the billboard campaign is particularly significant, coinciding with a rise in terrorist activities. The message conveyed through these billboards is clear: the Marines are prepared to confront and combat the threats posed by these extremist groups. This initiative is not merely about showcasing military readiness; it is also a strategic effort to counteract the pervasive fear that terrorists seek to instill in the hearts and minds of the American people.

While the campaign has garnered support from many, it has also drawn criticism, particularly from liberal circles. Some have expressed anger over the billboards, viewing them as a provocative response to a serious issue. However, the Marines remain unfazed by these opinions, standing firm in their belief that the message of resilience and readiness is essential in the fight against terrorism.

The billboards symbolize more than just military preparedness; they represent a broader message that if people refuse to be afraid, terrorists lose their power. By asserting their readiness to confront threats, the Marines aim to inspire confidence and courage among the public, encouraging individuals to stand strong in the face of adversity.

As the nation grapples with the realities of terrorism, the Marine Corps' billboard campaign serves as a reminder of the importance of resilience and unity. In a time when fear can easily take hold, the Marines are sending a clear message: they are ready to fight back, and they encourage the American people to do the same. The campaign not only highlights the Marines' commitment to national security but also seeks to empower citizens to reject the fear that terrorists aim to instill. In doing so, they hope to foster a sense of strength and solidarity in the face of ongoing threats.",-53.0,-19.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,473.0,-1.0555555555555556,-0.040169133192389

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has been rocked by severe rioting that has left the city grappling with widespread violence and significant damage to local businesses. The unrest has prompted North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency, a move aimed at restoring order and ensuring the safety of residents.

In response to the escalating situation, Governor McCrory has deployed the National Guard to assist local law enforcement in managing the chaos. The decision to call in the National Guard underscores the severity of the unrest, which has seen businesses looted and communities shaken by violence.

Officials have taken a firm stance against those participating in the riots, announcing that individuals caught engaging in rioting, looting, or any form of violence will face severe repercussions, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This measure is intended to deter further criminal activity and hold individuals accountable for their actions during this tumultuous time.

The consequences extend beyond adults, as minor children involved in such activities will also face significant repercussions. Not only will they be subject to the same penalties, but their parents may also suffer the consequences of their children's actions. Parents of minors caught rioting could lose state benefits, face referrals to social services, and even risk losing custody of their children. This approach highlights the emphasis on parental responsibility and the expectation that parents should closely monitor their children's behavior.

City official Wilson Stewart has been vocal about the need for parents to take responsibility for their children's actions. He urged parents to be vigilant and proactive in ensuring their children do not engage in activities that could lead to legal trouble. ""It is crucial for parents to understand the impact of their children's actions, not just on themselves but on the entire community,"" Stewart stated. His comments reflect a growing concern among officials about the role of families in preventing youth involvement in criminal activities.

To further restore order, a mandatory curfew has been implemented in Charlotte. The curfew aims to limit movement during the night and reduce the likelihood of further violence and looting. Authorities hope that by enforcing this curfew, they can create a safer environment for residents and begin the process of healing and rebuilding the community.

As Charlotte navigates this challenging period, the focus remains on restoring peace and ensuring that those responsible for the unrest are held accountable. The combination of a state of emergency, the deployment of the National Guard, and strict penalties for rioters reflects the city's commitment to regaining control and protecting its citizens.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of community stability and the importance of collective responsibility in maintaining peace. As the city works to recover from the recent turmoil, officials are calling on residents to come together and support one another in the face of adversity.",-33.0,-11.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,544.0,-0.5238095238095238,-0.02022058823529412

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

FBI Director James Comey is under increasing scrutiny and may be facing resignation as criticism mounts over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. The controversy has intensified following revelations that Comey granted immunity to several of Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills. Reports indicate that Mills allegedly did not fully cooperate with the investigation, raising questions about the integrity of the inquiry.

The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28, where Comey will be called to account for his actions during the investigation. This hearing comes at a time when public and political pressure is mounting, with calls for Comey to step down from his position. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has been particularly vocal, demanding Comey's resignation and questioning his fitness for office. DiGenova has characterized the investigation as inadequate, suggesting it resembled a ""protected investigation"" rather than a thorough and impartial inquiry.

As Congress continues to hold hearings to investigate the handling of the email scandal, Comey is expected to face tough questions regarding his decisions and the overall conduct of the investigation. Lawmakers are particularly interested in understanding the rationale behind granting immunity to Clinton's aides and the implications of such actions on the investigation's credibility.

Adding to the pressure, Comey has been issued a subpoena by Congress to provide documents related to the investigation. This subpoena follows previous instances where Comey failed to deliver requested documents, further fueling concerns about transparency and accountability within the FBI. The ongoing situation has led to speculation about Comey's loyalty to Clinton and how his actions may impact his career moving forward.

The fallout from the investigation has not only affected Comey but has also reignited discussions about the broader implications of the email scandal on the political landscape. As the hearings approach, the focus will be on whether Comey can effectively defend his actions and maintain his position as FBI Director amid the growing calls for his resignation.

With the September 28 hearing looming, the stakes are high for Comey, who must navigate a complex web of political pressures and public scrutiny. The outcome of this investigation and the subsequent hearings could have lasting effects on both Comey's career and the ongoing discourse surrounding the Clinton email scandal. As the situation develops, all eyes will be on the House Judiciary Committee and the revelations that may emerge from the upcoming hearings.",-17.0,-15.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,457.0,-0.8823529411764706,-0.03282275711159737

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has come under intense scrutiny for its alleged support of extremist groups and its involvement in human trafficking. As a significant donor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, the kingdom's actions have raised serious ethical questions about the relationship between U.S. politicians and a nation that has been linked to some of the most egregious human rights violations.

One of the most alarming aspects of this relationship is the troubling history of the majority of the 9/11 terrorists, who were found to be from Saudi Arabia. This revelation has led many to question the rationale behind continued U.S. support for the kingdom, especially in light of its controversial actions on the global stage. Critics argue that the U.S. must reassess its alliances, particularly when those partnerships may inadvertently support terrorism and human rights abuses.

Recent reports have surfaced indicating that Saudi Arabia is auctioning off sex slaves who have been captured by the Islamic State (ISIS). These victims include women from Iraq, Syria, and even Western nations, highlighting the international scope of this horrific practice. The auctions reportedly involve various nationalities, with Western women among those subjected to this brutal exploitation. The implications of such actions are staggering, as they reveal a disturbing intersection of human trafficking and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

The Islamic State has a notorious history of abusing and trafficking sex slaves, particularly targeting vulnerable populations such as Yazidi girls and non-Muslim women. The systematic nature of these abuses raises urgent questions about the complicity of nations that continue to engage with Saudi Arabia, a country that has been accused of turning a blind eye to these atrocities. The ongoing human rights violations perpetrated by ISIS, coupled with Saudi Arabia's alleged involvement, paint a grim picture of the current geopolitical landscape.

In light of these revelations, there is a growing call for an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Critics argue that providing military support to a nation that is implicated in such severe human rights abuses is not only morally indefensible but also counterproductive to the fight against terrorism. Politicians are urged to distance themselves from Saudi Arabia and reconsider the implications of their financial and political ties to the kingdom.

The complicity of Western leaders, including the current U.S. president, in these ongoing human rights abuses cannot be overlooked. As the world watches the unfolding crisis, there is a palpable concern that political leaders may prioritize strategic alliances over the fundamental rights of women and children affected by these atrocities. The potential election of leaders who disregard the plight of these vulnerable populations poses a significant threat to the progress made in human rights advocacy.

The situation calls for urgent action and accountability. It is imperative that politicians and world leaders recognize the gravity of the situation and take a stand against the exploitation of women and children. The international community must unite to condemn the actions of those who profit from human trafficking and support extremist groups. 

As the narrative surrounding Saudi Arabia continues to evolve, it is crucial for citizens and activists to remain vigilant and demand transparency from their leaders. The fight against human trafficking and the protection of human rights should transcend political affiliations and national interests. The time has come for a collective response to these heinous acts, ensuring that the voices of the victims are heard and that justice is served.

In conclusion, the troubling ties between Saudi Arabia and the ongoing human rights abuses perpetrated by ISIS necessitate a reevaluation of U.S. support for the kingdom. The auctioning of sex slaves and the complicity of Western leaders in these atrocities must not be ignored. It is a moral imperative for politicians to prioritize human rights and take decisive action to end the suffering of those caught in this tragic web of exploitation.",-30.0,-78.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,716.0,-2.888888888888889,-0.10893854748603352
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the 2016 election season unfolded with intense exchanges between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump. The event, held in front of a national audience, showcased the stark contrasts between the two candidates as they sparred over key issues.

NBC moderator Lester Holt faced significant criticism for his handling of the debate, particularly for his decision to interrupt Trump to ""fact-check"" him. Many observers noted that several of Holt's fact-checks were inaccurate, raising questions about the fairness of the moderation. A particularly contentious moment arose when Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War, a claim that Trump vehemently denied. This exchange highlighted the differing narratives surrounding the candidates' positions on foreign policy.

While Holt pressed Trump on his past comments regarding the Iraq War, he notably refrained from questioning Clinton about her own vote in favor of the war. This decision drew scrutiny from viewers and commentators alike, who felt that it created an uneven playing field during the debate. The focus on Trump’s past statements, without a similar examination of Clinton’s record, sparked discussions about media bias and the role of moderators in political debates.

Following the debate, Trump appeared in an interview with Neil Cavuto, where he elaborated on his views regarding the Iraq War. During this conversation, Trump expressed reservations about the decision to invade Iraq, suggesting that the United States should have waited for the United Nations to take action. This revelation added another layer to the ongoing debate about the candidates' foreign policy positions and their implications for the future.

The aftermath of the debate saw a wave of criticism directed at the mainstream media for what many perceived as an attempt to discredit Trump. Supporters of the Republican nominee argued that the media's focus on fact-checking and interruptions served to undermine his message and portray him in a negative light. In contrast, Trump was noted for standing his ground against both Clinton and the media, maintaining his composure amid the heated exchanges.

As the election season progresses, the dynamics established during this first debate are likely to influence the candidates' strategies moving forward. With the media landscape playing a crucial role in shaping public perception, both Clinton and Trump will need to navigate these challenges as they seek to connect with voters in the lead-up to the election. The debate has set the stage for what promises to be a contentious and closely watched campaign.",-9.0,-14.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,471.0,-0.7777777777777778,-0.029723991507430998
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The Birther movement, which gained traction during Barack Obama's presidency, continues to evoke discussions about the implications of its claims and whether they reflect a deeper bias against the former president. Central to this debate is a 2004 article published by Breitbart, which controversially stated, ""Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate."" This article emerged during a pivotal moment in Obama's political career, as he ascended in the Illinois Senate race following the withdrawal of his rival, Jack Ryan, due to a scandal.

Despite the sensational nature of the claims made in the Breitbart article, Obama never publicly refuted them. This silence has led to ongoing speculation about the authenticity of his birthplace. Adding to the intrigue is a 1991 promotional booklet from Obama’s literary agency, which described him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” This booklet was circulated among publishing industry colleagues and included a biography of Obama alongside other authors, raising questions about the accuracy of the information presented.

The existence of the 1991 booklet has fueled discussions about potential contradictions in Obama's narrative regarding his origins. Critics have speculated whether Obama may have manipulated aspects of his background for personal gain, particularly in relation to educational opportunities. Such speculation invites scrutiny of the motivations behind the Birther movement and whether it is rooted in legitimate concerns or a bias against Obama as a person of color in a position of power.

As the debate continues, the implications of questioning Obama's birthplace and citizenship remain significant. The validity of his American birth and citizenship is not merely a matter of personal identity; it is a fundamental requirement for anyone seeking the presidency. The Birther movement's insistence on challenging these aspects of Obama's life raises critical questions about the intersection of race, politics, and identity in America.

In conclusion, the Birther movement serves as a lens through which to examine broader societal biases and the complexities of political narratives. As discussions about Obama's origins persist, they highlight the need for a deeper understanding of how personal histories are perceived and manipulated in the political arena. The ongoing scrutiny of Obama's birthplace and citizenship underscores the importance of addressing these issues with a critical eye, recognizing the potential for bias and the implications it holds for the fabric of American democracy.",-18.0,-6.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,447.0,-0.4,-0.013422818791946308

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In a recent debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showcased an unusually prepared demeanor, captivating audiences with her performance. Notably, she did not exhibit her usual cough or reach for water, which has been a point of concern in past appearances. However, her polished presentation was not the only topic of discussion; social media users quickly turned their attention to a possible flesh-colored device visible in her ear, igniting a flurry of speculation regarding its purpose.

The device, which some observers suggested could be an earpiece, led to a wave of theories online. Questions emerged about whether the object was merely a trick of light, a fashion accessory, or even a ""Cough prevention machine."" The debate surrounding the device intensified as viewers scrutinized Clinton's every move, eager to uncover the truth behind the mysterious object.

In response to the growing speculation, Clinton's campaign swiftly denied the earpiece claims. They attributed the appearance of the device to reflections caused by the bright television lights used during the debate. This explanation, however, did little to quell the curiosity of the public and commentators alike.

Adding fuel to the fire, a leaked email from Clinton to her close aide Huma Abedin mentioned an earpiece, raising further questions about the nature of the device seen during the debate. The email's contents have led to increased scrutiny of Clinton's communication methods and whether she may have relied on external assistance during her performance.

Political commentator Woods weighed in on the controversy, criticizing Clinton and suggesting that she depends on others to effectively convey her messages. Woods' remarks reflect a broader sentiment among some critics who believe that Clinton's polished public persona may be supported by unseen aids, further complicating her already complex relationship with the electorate.

Despite the swirling rumors, there remains no definitive proof that the device in question was indeed an earpiece. Some observers have posited that it could simply be a hearing aid or, as Clinton's campaign suggested, a mere reflection from the stage lights. The ambiguity surrounding the device has left many in the political arena divided, with opinions ranging from skepticism to outright belief in the earpiece theory.

As the debate continues, the incident serves as a reminder of the intense scrutiny public figures face, particularly during high-stakes events like debates. The intersection of technology, perception, and politics has never been more pronounced, and Clinton's experience highlights the challenges candidates encounter in maintaining their image while navigating the complexities of modern communication.

In the end, whether the device was an earpiece, a reflection, or something entirely different remains a topic of speculation. As the political landscape evolves, so too will the narratives surrounding candidates and their performances, ensuring that discussions like these will continue to captivate audiences and fuel debates for years to come.",-5.0,5.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,542.0,0.25,0.00922509225092251
