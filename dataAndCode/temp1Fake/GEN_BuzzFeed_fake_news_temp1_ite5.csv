Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Former President Bill Clinton recently ignited a firestorm of criticism when he described it as ""natural"" for donors to the Clinton Foundation to seek favors from his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The remark has raised alarms and intensified scrutiny over Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, prompting discussions about the ethics surrounding the interplay of charitable donations and political influence.

Clinton's comments, delivered during a talk at a fundraiser, have fueled accusations of a pay-to-play scheme—an allegation frequently echoed by his political adversary Donald Trump. The term suggests that substantial donations to the Clinton Foundation might lead to preferential treatment in policy decisions or access to the Clinton political apparatus. Clinton attempted to clarify his stance, stating that while it is not unusual for donors to ask for favors, there is no evidence to suggest that any requests would actually lead to favors being granted.

The complexity surrounding these remarks is underscored by the release of leaked emails revealing that various donors to the Clinton Foundation had indeed met with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State. However, other requests for meetings from different donors were summarily denied, implying a lack of consistent access for all contributors. These disclosures have failed to provide concrete evidence of a quid pro quo arrangement, raising questions about the narratives being advanced by opponents.

Contrastingly, Donald Trump’s own philanthropic activities have come under scrutiny. Notably, Trump has not made any personal contributions to his own charity since 2008 and has been criticized for allegedly misusing foundation funds to cover personal expenses. Recent investigations led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman have sought to uncover whether the Trump Foundation violated state charity laws, highlighting a potential disconnect between the campaign rhetoric surrounding both candidates.

The media’s response to the controversy has also sparked debate. Media Matters, a progressive organization dedicated to monitoring media bias, has pointed out what they perceive as a double standard in media coverage comparing Clinton and Trump. Critics argue that the press has focused extensively on relatively minor issues concerning Hillary Clinton while simultaneously downplaying significant controversies surrounding the Trump Foundation.

Many observers believe that this differential treatment in media reporting may be inadvertently assisting Trump’s campaign while hindering Clinton’s prospects, cultivating an environment where narratives are crafted in ways that can favor one candidate over another. As the 2024 presidential election campaign heats up, this uneven media scrutiny seems to have potential implications for voter perception and engagement.

The juxtaposition of the two candidates illuminates a deeper philosophical debate regarding the boundaries and ethical considerations surrounding political donations and charitable contributions. As allegations about impropriety surface about both candidates, the discussion could lead to broader considerations about money in politics, transparency, and accountability.

With the election looming, the role of donors, their motivations, and the potential influence on political figures are coming under increasing examination. As Bill Clinton’s comments reverberate through the political landscape, it remains to be seen how this controversy will influence voter sentiment as candidates pivot to address both the pressing issues of governance and the ethical dilemmas posed by their fundraising mechanisms.

In the coming weeks, as the campaigns adjust to the evolving narrative, strategic communications will likely be employed to combat impressions that could be damaging to both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. With the stakes high, voters are left to sift through a mix of statements, media coverage, and ongoing investigations, all of which contribute to the changing perceptions of both candidates as they vie for the highest office in the nation. 

The intertwining of charitable endeavors and political aspirations presents a tangled web, with implications that stretch far beyond mere electoral dynamics, inviting a deeper reckoning with the tenets of democracy and integrity in governance. As the campaign progresses, this issue will undoubtedly continue to be a focal point of discussion and debate among voters and analysts alike.",6.0,-9.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,733.0,-0.375,-0.01227830832196453
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

In a developing story that raises serious ethical and health concerns, a draft congressional report has surfaced, suggesting that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), established by former President Bill Clinton, distributed diluted HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This troubling revelation has raised alarm among health experts and advocates, who worry that these practices may have significantly increased risks of morbidity and mortality among affected patients.

The report, titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” has gained attention for its detailed examination of the relationships between Bill Clinton, his health initiative, and the Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer Ranbaxy, a major distributor of HIV/AIDS drugs. Initiated by Representative Marsha Blackburn, this investigation digs deep into a controversial chapter of the former president’s legacy and the repercussions for patients relying on life-saving treatments.

CHAI has long been viewed as one of the Clinton Foundation’s most significant initiatives aimed at assisting AIDS victims, particularly in low-income regions. However, the findings indicate a troubling pattern of behavior surrounding the initiative’s dealings with Ranbaxy, which has faced serious allegations of fraudulent practices. Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower from Ranbaxy, played a pivotal role in exposing these concerns, ultimately helping the U.S. government launch a lawsuit against the company for its misleading operations and the quality of drugs it provided.

In 2013, Ranbaxy pleaded guilty to multiple criminal counts related to these issues, resulting in a hefty fine of $500 million. The Department of Justice linked the distribution of diluted drugs by Ranbaxy to increased health risks for patients—an alarming connection that has prompted further investigation into the extent of the harm caused. 

The draft report raises significant concerns regarding the number of patients potentially affected by the diluted drugs distributed by CHAI and the implications for the Clinton Foundation. With considerable funding from the U.S. government to Ranbaxy occurring as recently as 2007, the potential for widespread adverse health effects could be substantial, although the current extent of patient exposure remains unclear. 

Substandard HIV medicines can dramatically worsen health outcomes for patients, especially in a region where access to effective treatment is precarious. Experts have long warned that the quality of medications is essential, and any compromises could exacerbate the already dire health situations faced by many living with HIV/AIDS. Notably, troubling signs regarding Ranbaxy’s drug quality began surfacing in 2004, escalating with warnings from the FDA regarding the potency of their medications by 2006.

Despite these troubling warnings and the issues that were already surfacing, CHAI continued to distribute Ranbaxy’s drugs and maintained positive comments about the company’s practices. The ongoing commitment to Ranbaxy even in light of serious concerns raises questions about due diligence and oversight within CHAI’s operations.

Thakur, who has shifted his focus from pharmaceutical whistleblowing to public health advocacy, sought dialogue and engagement with CHAI and the Clinton Foundation regarding these dangerous practices. Unfortunately, he encountered silence from the organization, leaving many to wonder about the transparency and accountability of such a prominent health initiative.

Although CHAI officially separated from the Clinton Foundation in 2010, the two organizations maintain a closely coordinated relationship. This ongoing connection blurs the lines of responsibility and complicates accountability, particularly when allegations arise suggesting that Bill Clinton may have relaxed drug quality standards via executive order in 2000. If true, this action could have had significant repercussions for the quality of HIV medications distributed through programs like CHAI.

Additionally, the congressional report delves into potential corruption within these initiatives and the financial benefits received by the Clinton Foundation as a result. It proposes that questionable relationships developed between Bill Clinton and certain Indian-American businessmen involved in significant legal controversies. These ties have drawn scrutiny, further examining the ethical implications behind the Clinton Foundation’s operations and the impact on patients reliant on effective health programs.

Blackburn has been vocal about the emotional toll these findings could take on healthcare workers and patients who, until now, may have falsely believed in the efficacy of their treatments based on the assurances provided by the Clinton Foundation. The emotional impact on those who have consumed diluted medications for years prompts a need for urgent discourse on accountability and reform in global health initiatives. The health and safety of vulnerable populations should always remain a priority, and it appears that systemic issues may have led to a breach of trust.

As the investigation into these serious allegations unfolds, stakeholders within the healthcare community are urged to consider the ramifications of such findings. Further exploration into how diluted drugs ended up in the hands of patients and the extent of cooperation between CHAI and Indian pharmaceutical companies could yield significant insights into broader systemic failures.

As this story continues to evolve, the implications for both the Clinton Foundation and global health initiatives hang in the balance. It raises critical questions about the intersection of health, ethics, and global responsibility, emphasizing the monumental duty health organizations have to ensure the well-being of those they aim to serve. 

The intersection of public health and private interests calls for transparency and accountability, especially when life-threatening situations are in play. The potential fallout from these revelations may spark discourse around necessary reforms in health practices and standards, particularly for organizations influencing health outcomes in developing countries. As affected patients, the medical community, and policymakers weigh the implications of these findings, the hope is for a more robust framework prioritizing health over profit and ensuring that the critical needs of some of the world’s most vulnerable populations are adequately met. 

In a time when global health practices must prioritize patient safety, the findings of this congressional report present a compelling call for introspection and reform. The legacy of health initiatives like CHAI, once seen as beacons of hope for many, may now require reevaluation to uphold the standards that should inherently reflect the values of care, respect, and responsibility. The unfolding narrative raises a collective responsibility among stakeholders to advocate for ethical practices that genuinely aim to foster health and well-being across all communities—reflecting a foundational commitment to human rights in healthcare. 

As calls for accountability grow, the journey towards restoring trust and ensuring health equity will test the resilience of those involved in both the Clinton Foundation and global health initiatives, forging a path towards a future where due diligence and patient welfare are paramount. The need for systemic change, heightened scrutiny, and a refined commitment to ethical healthcare practices has never been more pressing, inviting all to engage in the critical conversation around health and justice in a world still grappling with profound inequities.",-6.0,7.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1229.0,0.1794871794871795,0.005695687550854353
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed shortly before entering her vehicle after attending the September 11 memorial ceremony in New York City. This incident has ignited a wave of speculation surrounding her health and capacity to engage in crucial political activities as the presidential race intensifies.

Witnesses reported that the 73-year-old Clinton appeared unsteady and required assistance before she fell, drawing immediate concern from the gathered crowd and the media. Shortly after this alarming episode, Clinton was seen leaving her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, looking remarkably revitalized and noticeably lighter than just a few hours prior. This sudden change has raised eyebrows and prompted discussions about the authenticity of her public appearances.

Observers have noted significant differences in Hillary’s appearance between these two events. The most striking of these changes is in her facial structure, particularly her nose, which some described as a “Roman-type” compared to her former “Nordic” shape. Moreover, it has been pointed out that this new version of Clinton appears to be younger and lacks a distinctive mole that the real Hillary possesses above her lip.

Such dramatic physical alterations have fueled a wave of conjecture that a clone may be stepping in to handle her public engagements, potentially due to ongoing health concerns. This theory suggests that the version of Hillary Clinton seen after dismissing the incident could be a surrogate, constructed to maintain her political presence and image during her campaign.

The implications of this theory are profound, especially regarding Clinton's capability to participate in essential debates with her rival, Donald Trump. Given the current political climate, debates are critical for any candidate hoping to sway the electorate. Concerns have been raised regarding whether the real Hillary can adequately manage these responsibilities or if she might be relegated to a behind-the-scenes role with her clone stepping into the spotlight.

Furthermore, questions loom over whether the real Hillary Clinton will be present or even heard throughout her potential presidency. If the speculation proves correct and the clone assumes the role of spokesperson and decision-maker, it could lead to unprecedented circumstances in American politics. The possibility that an individual less experienced in governance and without the same policy acumen as the real Hillary could essentially serve as a figurehead raises alarms among political analysts and citizens alike.

As whispers of this scenario circulate, the overarching concern is whether the American public deserves more transparency regarding their leaders. The notion that the country might be governed by a clone—an entity seemingly designed for public relations—challenges the fundamental tenets of democracy. An administration led by a figurehead, where major decisions are made in absentia by someone not elected, could undermine the faith voters have in their leaders.

While these theories are indeed extraordinary, they highlight the anxiety surrounding Clinton’s health and the implications her condition could have on her campaign and potential presidency. Political commentators have expressed their belief that the situation warrants clear and honest communication from the Clinton campaign regarding her health status.

In conclusion, the events following Clinton's collapse have transformed into a source of speculation and uncertainty, prompting crucial discussions about the nature of public appearances and the integrity of political leadership. Whether or not these theories hold any weight, the current political landscape demands vigilance and accountability from its candidates. As more unfolds regarding Hillary Clinton’s health, the implications will undoubtedly shape her campaign narrative leading up to the election.

Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

As election season heats up, former President Donald Trump has reignited debates surrounding immigration and terrorism with a series of contentious statements and policy proposals. These positions, which have drawn both ardent supporters and fierce criticism, raise questions about their implications for American society, particularly with regard to the nation’s Muslim community.

A focal point of Trump's rhetoric has been the proposed construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, aimed at preventing the entry of individuals characterized by Trump as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" This inflammatory language, which targets immigrants, serves to conflate immigration with crime, while painting a monochrome picture of complex immigration issues. Trump's framing suggests an approach grounded not in detailed policy analysis but rather in fear-mongering, stirring emotions among his base.

In addition to the wall, Trump's proposed creation of a national registry for Muslims has drawn harsh criticism. This suggestion evokes memories of some of history’s most egregious discriminatory practices, raising alarms over civil liberties and the risks of stigmatizing an entire faith community. Critics argue that implementing such a registry could resemble past injustices, turning back the clock on progress made toward equality and understanding among diverse groups within America.

Further intensifying the debate over national security, Trump has proposed measures that extend to the families of terrorists. His assertion that the families of suspected terrorists do not value their loved ones' lives suggests a troubling endorsement of collective punishment. Trump’s statements imply that he believes this strategy would deter terrorism, despite a lack of evidence supporting the idea that punishing relatives would have a significant impact on terrorist activities. Critics question the morality and legality of such a position, as it targets innocent individuals based solely on the actions of others.

In light of recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, Trump's communications team pivoted focus, stating that the candidate aims to combat the “narratives” of former President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, rather than directly addressing the threat of terrorism itself. This strategic move suggests a pivot to a culture war frame, where Trump emphasizes ideological conflicts rather than offering substantial solutions to the challenges posed by terrorism.

The criticism leveled against Obama and Clinton regarding immigration policies struck a similar chord in Trump's rhetoric. He claimed that their initiatives, particularly the increase in Syrian refugee intake, have exacerbated terrorism threats. By blaming Democratic leaders for perceived weaknesses in the immigration system, Trump positions himself as a tough-on-terrorism candidate, yet lacks a comprehensive policy framework to address these complex issues effectively.

Trump's repeated assertions linking Muslims to terrorist attacks have raised concerns about generalizations that could lead to widespread prejudice. He has suggested that Muslims do not report suspicious behavior adequately, which analysts warn could contribute to a culture of mistrust and hostility. Critics argue that sweeping generalizations undermine the contributions that Muslim Americans make to society and divert attention from the nuanced realities of terrorism, which cannot be reduced to simple categories of religion or ethnicity.

This focus on identity is also a source of alarm for rights advocates, who warn that Trump's policies may lead to mass targeting of innocent individuals based solely on their faith or ethnic background. As he continues to question how he defines terrorism, concerns mount regarding the potential implications for civil liberties and community relations in the United States.

Trump's approach to conflict and crises often leans toward aggressive rhetoric. In discussions surrounding national security, he has made references to using nuclear weaponry in a more casual manner than many find appropriate. Such statements raise eyebrows and evoke unease, as they suggest a willingness to resort to extreme measures without fully considering the consequences of such actions. 

Moreover, the recent attacks attributed to individuals who are American citizens challenge Trump's narrative that links terrorism solely to immigration or external threats. These assaults were perpetrated by individuals with rights and responsibilities inherent to citizenship, indicating a growing concern that Trump's calls for violence against civilians could escalate existing tensions. His stance seemingly fails to recognize the complexities of radicalization and domestic terrorism which can arise within American society, irrespective of immigration status.

As Trump continues to campaign for another presidential term, the potential for his policies to influence the future of the nation looms large. Critics are wary, fearing that his election could represent a dire shift in American values and governance. The characterization of immigrants and Muslims in Trump’s rhetoric offers a glimpse into a future marked by heightened division and strife in a country that prides itself on diversity and inclusion.

In summation, Trump's provocative statements and proposals surrounding immigration and terrorism have sparked a national conversation fraught with tension and uncertainty.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, advocating for One World Government and globalization.

In his final speech to the assembly, Obama urged nations to adopt liberal democracy and increased international collaboration, underscoring that, despite challenges, violence and poverty are currently at historic lows.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

In the wake of persistent allegations regarding pay-to-play corruption involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, scrutiny of the foundation’s financial practices has intensified. Critics argue that the foundation serves as a financial vehicle primarily benefiting the Clinton family and their associates, raising questions about the true intention behind its operations.

Initially, the Clinton campaign defended the foundation's positive contributions in an effort to counteract these corruption allegations. However, a report by The Daily Caller has illuminated some troubling financial figures that suggest a stark discrepancy between revenue intake and charitable giving. 

In 2014, the foundation's overall spending reached just under $91.3 million, with a mere 5.7% of that budget—equating to less than $5.2 million—funneled into charitable grants. This raises significant concerns about how the majority of the funds were utilized. Comparatively, the foundation allocated a staggering $34.8 million on salaries and benefits, alongside $50.4 million on what it described as “other expenses.” Additionally, nearly $851,000 was earmarked for professional fundraising, further illuminating how financial resources were allocated within the organization.

Despite an infusion of $30 million in revenue for the year, the foundation's charitable spending saw a notable decline—40% less than the previous year. This juxtaposition prompts questions about the foundation’s priorities, especially as it simultaneously ramped up spending on salaries and other operational costs by $10 million in the same period.

The reported figures culminate in an unsettling conclusion—the foundation’s operations may primarily serve as a means for the Clintons to generate income, rather than fulfilling the purported mission to support charitable causes. 

As the narrative surrounding the Clinton Foundation unfolds, it is clear that the financial practices within the organization have sparked significant debate. While defenders of the Clintons tout the positive work they believe the foundation accomplishes, critics are increasingly resolute in their claims of a corporate-style operation lacking a genuine commitment to philanthropy.

The opinion expressed herein represents the perspective of the author and does not necessarily reflect the views or endorsements of the publication. As the conversation around these allegations continues, the public remains vigilant, seeking transparency and accountability from one of the most scrutinized philanthropic entities in recent history.",25.0,14.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,418.0,1.0,0.03349282296650718
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

Initially, her campaign attributed the episode to the heat, but it was later revealed that the temperature in NYC was a mild 74 degrees.

Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea's apartment rather than a hospital, raising further questions about her health and the circumstances surrounding the situation. Speculation intensified with allegations that the Greensboro rally may have been staged. Observers have raised concerns about the legitimacy of the audience present at the rally, as a video from the event prompted numerous viewer inquiries.

Further investigation into the footage has led to additional videos suggesting that the audience at the rally was fabricated. A particular reference to a C-Span video aims to verify the authenticity of the claims made regarding the rally's true nature. As these discussions unfold, the public remains attentive to both Clinton's health and the transparency of her campaign activities. The scrutiny surrounding this event reflects growing concerns that could have implications for her political future as she heads into an election period.",4.0,1.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,235.0,0.1111111111111111,0.00425531914893617
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the buzz surrounding the forthcoming satirical film ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" intensifies, discussions about its subject, Hillary Clinton, continue to evolve. The film's title itself evokes not only curiosity but also critical dialogue regarding the pervasive media narrative that has long surrounded Clinton's political career and personal health.

Critique of the media’s unwavering support for Hillary Clinton has reached a fever pitch, with many suggesting that this allegiance extends to the dismissal of serious health concerns that have been discussed intermittently over the years. A growing number of commentators assert that Clinton's health is not only a matter of public interest but is symptomatic of broader issues surrounding transparency and accountability in politics.

Reports detailing Clinton’s struggles with various health ailments raise significant questions about her ability to perform effectively in high office. Observations from critics highlight that her health has not been as robust as her public representation might suggest. Since 2003, Clinton has had the presence of a personal physician during medical emergencies, which has led to speculation about the severity and implications of these health issues.

Further fueling these speculations are concerns that Clinton may be facing neurological issues. The use of blue-tinted glasses, believed to relate to seizures or Parkinson’s disease, has captured the attention of both skeptics and supporters. Such indications provoke a broader discussion about the ramifications of health on public service and the transparency owed to the electorate.

The accusations against Clinton's campaign depict a troubling narrative regarding its commitment to openness, particularly in relation to her health. As the tide of public opinion begins to shift, critics argue that a lack of transparency serves to undermine public trust, an essential pillar in any democracy.

Clinton's approval ratings have taken a hit in light of recent controversies, with public sentiment souring further after her comments about Donald Trump supporters. The controversy surrounding these remarks may have compounded existing doubts about her character, with many claiming that she has betrayed the trust placed in her by the American public.

The steady decline in Clinton's poll numbers highlights the repercussions of such missteps, as her political career faces challenges not only from within her own party but also from evolving public perceptions. Historical references to Clinton's past affiliations only add to the complexities of her political persona, as critics question her integrity and call attention to accusations of racism that have plagued her career.

Immersed in this atmosphere of critique, it appears that public sentiment encompasses mixed feelings regarding Clinton's struggles. Observers acknowledge her humanity and the sheer weight of her experiences, but the scrutiny of her actions and character remains robust. This duality reflects the complex nature of political figures—where public admiration can swiftly transform into disillusionment.

Despite these challenges, there are those who speculate about the possibility of Clinton winning the upcoming election. With considerable backing from both a loyal media apparatus and an adept medical team, her campaign may stand on a precarious but potentially effective foundation. This dual reliance on supportive networks raises further questions about the authenticity of her political standing.

Amid this swirling environment of speculation and critique, many wish for Clinton’s well-being in her private life while simultaneously hoping for the decline of her political influence. This sentiment acknowledges that personal struggles do exist beyond the public facade, and that compassion might coexist with criticism.

The diverse opinions expressed—highlighting Clinton’s complicated legacy, the implications of her health, and the dynamics of media support—reflect a broader discourse on political accountability. Individual perspectives vary widely, emphasizing that the evaluations of public figures cannot be reduced to simplistic narratives.

As the anticipation for “Weekend at Chelsea's” grows, it serves not only as a satirical commentary but also as a reflection of the evolving narratives surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and political career. However, it is crucial to note that these reflections are not indicative of a consensus but rather represent individual viewpoints on a highly contentious figure in contemporary politics. Ultimately, the film and ensuing discussions may provide a lens through which audiences can engage with the multifaceted realities of political life and the importance of health, transparency, and public trust.",-18.0,4.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,793.0,0.13793103448275862,0.005044136191677175

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant and reflective final address to the United Nations Assembly, President Barack Obama articulated his deep concerns regarding the ongoing struggle against ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. The event marked a significant moment in his tenure as he candidly expressed his doubts about the efficacy of military power in combating these multifaceted threats. 

Obama poignantly referred to ISIS as a ""JV team,"" highlighting a perception that belittles their capability but acknowledges the serious implications of their brutal actions. He underscored the importance of recognizing the limitations of U.S. military power, suggesting that such strength alone cannot effectively address the complex tapestry of loyalties and enmities entwined in the region. 

The president presented a sobering reality: no external power can impose coexistence upon conflicting religious and ethnic communities. This admission points to a fundamental challenge in international diplomacy—any viable solution must originate from within these communities and among their leaders. Obama advocated for a cooperative global effort, emphasizing the necessity for the international community to partner with those dedicated to building rather than destroying amidst these conflicts.

While acknowledging the military dimension entwined in the fight against ISIS, Obama was unequivocal about the situation in Syria, describing it as a landscape devoid of any foreseeable military victory. His recognition of the limitations of force was a crucial aspect of his address, suggesting that military intervention alone is insufficient to navigate the complexities of the region’s strife.

Rather than relying solely on armed responses, Obama urged a shift towards diplomatic efforts, cessation of violence, humanitarian aid delivery, and robust support for political settlements. He called for a strategic, multifaceted approach that prioritizes peace and stability over aggressiveness and further conflict. In doing so, he laid the groundwork for future engagements that could yield more sustainable outcomes in the fight against radicalism.

The address not only highlighted Obama’s concerns about ISIS but also critiqued the broader perception of radical Islam as a minor threat. There was a palpable sense of frustration regarding liberal attitudes that appear to downplay the significant dangers posed by extremist ideologies and actions. Obama’s words reflected a call to reassess these ideological views and tackle the perceived threats with greater urgency.

In conclusion, Obama’s final address serves as both a cautionary tale and a rallying cry for action against radical extremism. It stresses that the international community must urgently confront these challenges—not just with military might, but with concerted diplomatic efforts and a clear commitment to supporting the oppressed and building bridges between divided communities. As the global landscape continues to evolve, the need for decisive action against radical extremism grows ever more critical.",-5.0,-8.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,501.0,-0.42105263157894735,-0.015968063872255488
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have unveiled a concerning connection between the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and actions taken by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as far back as 2012. According to these documents, there are allegations that the Obama Administration purposely sought to foster the conditions that led to the formation of ISIS as part of a strategy to isolate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

Investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed has highlighted that the leaked documents outline a coordinated effort among Gulf states and Turkey to fund militant groups with the expectation that this support would culminate in the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. This approach reflects a troubling deviation from direct interventions, leading to escalating violence and chaos in the region.

Critics have pointed to President Obama's portrayal of ISIS as a “JV” team as a significant miscalculation, arguing that it downplayed the group’s burgeoning threat. Additionally, the administration’s choice not to maintain a residual force in Iraq has come under scrutiny, as many view this decision as contributing to the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to thrive.

Moreover, the declassified documents shed light on controversial weapons operations in Libya leading up to the 2012 Benghazi attack. They indicate that U.S. intelligence was aware of arms shipments being funneled from Benghazi to Syrian ports, suggesting a direct involvement that further complicates U.S. foreign policy narratives. There are sobering implications of negligence, as the report implies that U.S. servicemen and individuals in Benghazi may have been sacrificed due to these secretive Middle Eastern policies that inadvertently contributed to the rise of a brutal terrorist group.

The revelations have raised serious concerns about whether the Obama Administration placed a higher priority on hiding facts than on ensuring national security. Critics argue that this prioritization has had lasting repercussions, contributing to an unstable landscape in the Middle East and emboldening extremist factions. As the implications of these documents continue to unfold, the discourse around U.S. involvement in the region remains more critical than ever.",-27.0,-24.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,397.0,-2.0,-0.060453400503778336
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a surprising turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton experienced a collapse shortly before stepping into her van after being removed from the 9/11 Memorial Ceremony in New York City. This incident has sparked a wave of speculation regarding her health and ongoing candidacy in the upcoming election.

Shortly after the incident, Clinton was seen leaving her daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment, appearing notably energetic and significantly different in her physical appearance. Observers pointed out striking changes in her overall look, including substantial weight loss, a newfound vibrancy, and an altered facial structure. One of the most discussed features was her nose, which some have described as a Roman type, in stark contrast to the Nordic nose that has been associated with her for decades.

This unexpected transformation has led to numerous theories and conjectures, with many suggesting that what was witnessed post-collapsing was not the ""real"" Hillary Clinton, but rather a stand-in or clone. Commentators noted this version of Clinton appeared younger, exhibiting reduced signs of aging, and notably lacked a mole that is typically present on her face. 

As speculation mounts, observers are now questioning if the clone or stand-in will assume the majority of Clinton’s public appearances as she navigates her health challenges in the run-up to the election. With upcoming debates with Donald Trump on the horizon, doubts are arising about her ability to engage fully in such high-stakes political events given her recent health scare. 

Indicators to watch in the coming weeks might include any notable shifts in her weight, a new youthful appearance, or variations in her voice clarity—all factors that could suggest the presence of the rumored clone. The discussions surrounding Clinton's health and appearance go beyond mere curiosity, as they delve into serious implications for her potential role in a future presidency, should she win the election.

There is burgeoning speculation concerning how much involvement the real Hillary Clinton could have in her administration. Many are pondering if the clone will take charge of public engagements and decision-making processes, effectively sidelining the original Clinton. This raises significant concerns regarding the nature of political leadership and accountability in a possible Clinton Administration. 

The prospect of a Clinton presidency operating with a figurehead, while decisions are enacted by other leaders or a clone, poses unprecedented questions for the American political landscape. This situation could signify a distinctive chapter in U.S. history, suggesting that actual executive power might not rest in the hands of the elected President. Such speculation inevitably calls into question the value of authenticity and agency in a political system increasingly shaped by external narratives.

As the discourse continues, parallels are being drawn to speculation surrounding former President Barack Obama, suggesting this may not be an isolated event of concern but rather part of a broader trend in political leadership. The implications reverberate throughout the political sphere as voters grapple with the realities of representation and the authenticity of their leaders.

In concluding this extraordinary set of developments, it is pertinent to reflect on how Hillary Clinton's current circumstances may reshape the contours of political ambition and governance in America. It could very well be a unique moment, signaling the potential redefining of presidential authority and actual power within the highest office in the land.

The evolving scenario regarding Hillary Clinton beckons close attention as it may portend significant shifts in political engagement and representation as the election approaches.",8.0,14.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,674.0,0.6086956521739131,0.020771513353115726
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Rumors surrounding the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have intensified in recent days, raising questions about her viability as a candidate in the upcoming political landscape. Speculation about a possible nervous breakdown has gained traction after a concerning video surfaced, in which Clinton appeared to struggle with eye control. This alarming incident has reportedly led to the cancellation of a fundraiser scheduled in North Carolina.

As the political calendar progresses, Clinton’s public appearances have become notably sparse. Between September 20 and October 19, she has only one rally on her agenda, with all other events being fundraisers where she is not included as a speaker. This contrast starkly highlights the bustling campaign schedule of her political rival, Donald Trump, who has four rallies taking place between September 20 and 22 alone.

Compounding concerns about her health, recent observations revealed that Clinton needed assistance from Secret Service agents while navigating two steps at a recent rally. This incident has contributed to growing apprehension among her supporters, many of whom predict a potential public meltdown could occur if her health issues persist.

In response to these escalating worries, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly exploring the possibility of finding replacements for Clinton. However, the search has encountered challenges, particularly with Bernie Sanders, who is currently perceived as unwilling to step into the presidential spotlight. This predicament adds to the DNC's complications as Clinton has long been positioned as the party’s best chance at maintaining competitiveness in the electoral arena, a fact underscored by documented past support in emails.

As the political atmosphere grows increasingly charged, there are claims circulating that Clinton is suffering from some form of illness, with expectations that the truth about her condition may soon become more widely recognized. The anticipation surrounding this situation suggests that developments regarding Clinton’s health and the implications for her potential candidacy could emerge in the coming days, keeping both supporters and critics on edge.

For now, the political stage remains uncertain, and as rumors swirl, the future of Hillary Clinton’s role in upcoming elections hangs in the balance. The landscape is watchful as discussions about her health and potential replacements unfold within the Democratic Party.",-8.0,-9.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,426.0,-0.6,-0.02112676056338028
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

*By [Your Name]*

In the annals of recent history, few events have been as globally impactful as the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, more commonly known as ISIS. However, the story of its inception is not merely one of political unrest and extremist ideologies; it intriguingly begins within the walls of the White House on a night when the then-President Barack Obama found himself wrestling with insomnia.

Late one fateful night, the quiet corridors of the West Wing echoed with the footfalls of a restless Obama. As he roamed the hushed halls, feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders, inspiration struck him unexpectedly. Struck by a surge of creativity, he scribbled down the word ""ISIS"" on a Post-It note without fully comprehending the implications behind the term he had just coined. At that moment, the idea laid dormant, a mere word capturing an essence he would soon seek to explore.

Months later, the concept began to evolve in an entirely unexpected setting: the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Amidst the pulsating rhythms and vibrant atmosphere, Obama found himself captivated by the energy of the crowd. The festival offered a welcome escape from the political rigors of his office, allowing him to connect with his youthful spirit. It was during this electrifying experience that he crossed paths with a woman whose brief encounter would prove to be a catalyst for his ambitions.

In this encounter, something sparked within him. Motivated by a newfound determination, Obama set his sights on creating an international terrorist organization—an endeavor that would resonate far beyond his personal aspirations. The seemingly innocent festival, brimming with music and camaraderie, morphed into the backdrop for a far more ominous undertaking. His mind began to weave together the elements of a global network that could send shockwaves across nations.

As he returned to the White House, excitement coursed through him. However, when Obama began to share his grand vision for ISIS with others, he was met with skepticism. The idea, ambitious as it was, provoked doubt and bewilderment among his inner circle. Undeterred, he recognized the need for a confidante—someone who might not only listen but engage deeply with the plans he envisioned.

That person turned out to be none other than Hillary Clinton. In a private conversation that unfolded amidst the domestic rhythms of the White House kitchen, Obama unveiled his most closely guarded secret. “Hillary,” he began, “I have something to share, something significant. I’m actually a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim who has devised plans to destroy America.” 

Hillary’s initial reaction was one of shock and confusion. The gravity of his revelation hung in the air, intertwining with the scent of coffee brewing nearby. Yet, as the initial surprise faded, her intrigue mounted. She leaned in closer, eager to explore the depths of his ideas about ISIS. This conversation, seemingly absurd at the outset, evolved into a serious discussion about the potential ramifications of the organization he was passionately describing.

Their dialogue unfolded under the embrace of the night, transiting from the kitchen to the inviting stillness of the Rose Garden. As they sat together, enveloped by the stars above, the depth of their plans for ISIS began to illuminate not just their minds but their ambitions as well. Hours melted away as they entangled themselves in discussions that ranged from strategic approaches to their ultimate goals, each contributing thoughts that would shape the organization’s ideology.

Hillary proposed that they bide their time, suggesting they wait for her presidency to fully execute their plans for America’s secret annihilation together. The notion excited Obama, filling him with unprecedented validation. For the first time, he felt genuinely understood in his quest, as if their ambitions aligned perfectly against a common backdrop.

As dawn broke, their conspiratorial musings took on a lighter tone. The stars faded into soft hues of morning light, and laughter intertwined with their ambitious plotting. In that surreal and whimsical atmosphere, they painted a vision of their grand design, their voices echoing against the stillness of the garden, with the sun rising over a nation blissfully unaware of the schemes brewing within its corridors of power.

This story, though laced with the details of a fictive conversation, captures the essence of unconventional collaboration in the political sphere. It serves to remind us how the most complex and troubling facets of world events often have beginnings that are as unexpected as they are profound.

In retrospect, it appears surreal to think of such weighty matters germinating in an environment that one might otherwise associate with music, freedom, and youthful exuberance. What started as restless meanderings in the White House transformed into an audacious plot discussed under starlit skies—a juxtaposition that encapsulates the dichotomy of leadership, ambition, and the ever-blurring lines between reality and fiction.

As the world reflects on the implications of ISIS today, one can only speculate about the ramifications of conversations held under the veil of darkness, often unnoticed, but filled with shadows of humanity's most pressing conflicts and aspirations. What emerged was not just an organization but a phenomenon that continues to challenge the world stage, raising further questions about the motivations and inner workings of not just those who joined its ranks, but also about the very architects behind its creation. The interplay of music, politics, and existential ambition, facilitated by unlikely connections, offers a narrative rich with lessons for those who dare to dream amidst a chaotic world. 

In capturing these moments—where simple thoughts blossomed into complex realities—the underlying story reminds us that often, our greatest challenges and changes arise from the most unexpected of places. What began as an insomnia-driven wander down the halls of the West Wing led to deliberations that forever altered the course of history, demonstrating that the origins of great movements can sometimes be as peculiar as they are terrifying. 

In telling this narrative, we glimpse the extraordinary influences behind one of the 21st century’s most formidable challenges. Herein lies the power of ideas, friendships, and the accidental convergence of ambitions—serving as a cautionary tale of the fragility of our societal fabric and the complex dynamics that shape our world.",-4.0,30.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,1180.0,0.6521739130434783,0.025423728813559324
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In recent weeks, the political landscape has once again been shaken by stark promises and rhetoric, particularly from former President Donald Trump. In the wake of attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, Trump boldly claimed he would “destroy” terrorism in America, a statement that has unraveled into a complex debate about the feasibility of such promises and the implications for civil liberties in the U.S.

The comment echoes historical precedents, invoking past political declarations that promised much but delivered little. Frank Wilkenmeyer recalls the infamous “no new taxes” pledge from former President George H.W. Bush, which ultimately became a symbol of political betrayal when it was abandoned. Wilkenmeyer’s reflections highlight a pattern in which candidates make grand promises, coupled with the insinuation of a reformed approach to governance, only to fall short once they were in office. 

Trump’s announcement came in a charged atmosphere, as the nation grapples with the evolving nature of terrorist threats. However, beyond the dramatic language of “destroying” terrorism lies a troubling undercurrent. Trump’s remarks not only attacked the current administration, specifically targeting President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton but also contained alarming suggestions regarding the treatment of specific communities within the United States. He vowed to eliminate all terrorists and to bring an end to terrorism on U.S. soil, but at what cost?

Critics have raised serious concerns that such promises imply a shift toward extreme measures that could infringe upon civil liberties. There is apprehension that Trump's rhetoric suggests potential increases in surveillance and police presence in Muslim communities, framing these actions as preemptive defenses against the perceived threat. This notion of profiling and targeted action has stirred fears of unjust discrimination, bringing to light historical parallels with oppressive governmental policies.

The implications of Trump’s approach raise alarming questions about the balance between national security and individual freedoms. Some commentators have drawn unsettling comparisons to fascism, arguing that the potential for authoritarian measures looms large with his proposed policies. The fear is that by declaring an all-out war on terrorism without a clear and measured strategy, the administration could embrace draconian tactics. 

Moreover, critics argue that Trump’s promise to “destroy” terrorism lacks a basis in reality, calling it a mere fear tactic designed to resonate with certain voter sentiments. The idea that terrorism can be vanquished through declarations is not only simplistic but dangerously misleading. The challenge of combating terrorism is multifaceted and requires comprehensive laws, community engagement, and international cooperation.

Contrary to Trump's assertions, simply claiming to “destroy” terrorism overlooks the roots and complexities of radicalization and the numerous factors that contribute to violence. Effective counter-terrorism efforts demand a nuanced approach that includes addressing the socio-economic conditions that fuel extremism, engaging with communities, and ensuring that measures taken do not alienate potential allies in the fight against terror. 

In essence, while the rhetoric surrounding terrorism can evoke feelings of urgency and require robust responses, the reality is that a deep-rooted issue such as terrorism cannot be solved through mere assertions or proclamations. It requires sustained effort, collaboration across various sectors, and above all, a commitment to uphold civil liberties. To suggest otherwise falls into a pattern of political posturing that has become all too familiar in recent years.

As the political discourse intensifies, it is imperative for both leaders and citizens to engage with these promises critically. Understanding the limitations of rhetoric, particularly when it comes to complex issues like terrorism, can guide voters in making informed choices while holding public officials accountable. In a world already fraught with divisions and tensions, ensuring that our responses to threats remain proportional and just is vital to maintaining the very freedoms that define the American experience. 

In conclusion, while the call to “destroy” terrorism might resonate with a frustrated populace, the path forward demands a far more nuanced and comprehensive strategy—one that respects individual rights and invokes unity rather than division. As history has taught us, the power of words is significant, but the implementation of policies grounded in reality must always take precedence.",-28.0,-29.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,779.0,-1.0,-0.037227214377406934
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

At the recent AUSA Global Force Symposium, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno cautioned that the United States is at a strategic inflection point due to escalating global terrorism and increased hostilities, particularly from the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno emphasized the emergence of a dangerous tipping point, where diminishing military readiness could have dire consequences for national and ally security.

During his address, Gen. Odierno highlighted that the Army is currently only generating enough readiness to meet immediate operational needs. He warned that further reductions in military personnel and capabilities could exacerbate the ongoing challenges faced by the armed forces. The Army has already reduced its active force by 80,000 soldiers and made significant cuts to brigade combat teams and aviation brigades, which could hinder the U.S.'s ability to effectively respond to emerging threats.

Gen. Odierno also noted a considerable gap between the military and the current administration, a rift that began during the Obama Administration. He pointed to a trend in which military commanders' advice and warnings have often been overlooked, contributing to the rise of groups like ISIS. This ongoing disconnect has raised concerns about the preparedness of U.S. military forces in the face of increasingly complex global threats.

With military modernization investments decreasing by 25%, crucial programs related to infantry fighting vehicles and scout helicopters remain at risk. Odierno criticized the current administration's perceived incompetence and arrogance, indicating that this has not only affected military operations but has also impacted the careers of many service members.

""Our nation faces enormous challenges, and we must recognize the growing threats we encounter both at home and abroad,"" Gen. Odierno stated. As the Army grapples with these pressing issues, the need for a robust and ready military force has never been more critical.

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.

Cruz argues that this transfer could grant countries such as Russia, China, and Iran the power to censor Internet speech, significantly impacting free expression not just globally, but also within the United States.

Warning that this move represents a serious threat to the principles of freedom of speech, thought, and the exchange of ideas, Cruz is calling on Congress to take urgent action prior to the proposal's scheduled implementation date of September 30, 2016. He emphasized that this issue has not garnered sufficient attention, asserting that many Americans remain unaware of its potential repercussions.

With the deadline approaching, Cruz is advocating for increased awareness among the public and legislative action to safeguard online freedom against what he perceives as encroaching control from foreign governments.

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

In the ever-evolving landscape of American politics, the focus on election integrity remains paramount. Elections are governed by laws specific to each state, ensuring that citizens can cast their votes fairly and transparently. However, one author has taken a contentious stance, labeling the National Democratic Party as a “powerful hate group” and accusing them of attempting to manipulate electoral outcomes through fraudulent practices.

The author argues that the Democratic Party is engaged in a systematic effort to “steal” elections. Allegations of voter fraud and ballot stuffing are central to this viewpoint, with claims that such actions are part of a broader agenda aimed at establishing a socialist dictatorship in the U.S. This supposed scheme includes the depiction of “Hillary the Horrible” as a potential president, fostering fears about the direction of the country.

In light of these serious allegations, the author emphasizes the importance of proper election procedures. These protocols are intended to encourage all eligible citizens to participate in the voting process while simultaneously preventing any practices that could enable voter fraud. As a proposed solution, the author calls for the implementation of mandatory photo identification for voters. According to this perspective, requiring photo ID would help ensure that only eligible individuals can participate in elections.

Despite the rationale behind the proposed voter ID laws, the author accuses the Democratic Party of actively opposing such measures. This opposition is seen as a strategy to allow ineligible voters to partake in the electoral process, furthering the assertion that there is a concerted effort to undermine election integrity. The narrative extends to the claim that fair election practices have been suppressed by a coalition including the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, Congress, and federal courts. 

In a rallying call to action, the author encourages citizens to engage in mass volunteerism, specifically to monitor polling places and safeguard against potential voter fraud. This call underscores a belief that grassroots involvement is necessary to uphold the integrity of elections. By monitoring polling locations, individuals can serve as watchdogs to ensure that elections are conducted fairly, a responsibility the author believes is essential for maintaining the republic.

Portrayed positively within this framework is Donald Trump, who is depicted as a champion in the fight against tyranny. The author lauds his commitment to saving America, positioning him as a crucial figure in the preservation of democratic values contrary to the alleged agendas of the Democratic Party.

Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

As we approach the next presidential campaign, the echoes of the past are vividly surfacing, particularly referencing the infamous “Daisy” advertisement from the 1964 campaign. This groundbreaking ad, linked to President Lyndon B. Johnson, aimed to resonate emotionally with viewers by suggesting that his opponent, Barry Goldwater, was a warmonger capable of unleashing nuclear devastation. The juxtap was stark, especially considering Johnson's own involvement in escalating the Vietnam War, yet the narrative prevailed as a pivotal moment in campaign advertising.

Fast-forward to the present, and the notion of a new “Daisy” ad seems to hover in the air, albeit with a different target. Hillary Clinton's controversial past and the plethora of challenges she has faced in her political journey could provide fertile ground for a similar campaign strategy. The implications of her track record as Secretary of State, alongside her various missteps, have laid the groundwork for a campaign that might effectively utilize a “Daisy”-esque approach to highlight her failures.

Rumors have already begun to circulate within political circles, hinting at the possibility of a “Daisy” remake focusing on Donald Trump. Such speculation is increasingly viewed as an indication of desperation among Clinton's staffers as they seek innovative ways to combat the challenges presented by a formidable opponent. The original ad, while historic, is now a relic of a time when political advertising was undergoing a transformation, blending emotional messaging with stark imagery—the sort of tactics that could be mirrored to address contemporary candidates and their failings.

As the media continues to dissect the nuances of the current political landscape, it becomes apparent that impressions shape discourse. Particularly noteworthy in this regard is the scrutiny surrounding Ted Cruz’s recent political maneuvering. His apparent shifts in stance have been met with what many regard as slanted coverage, especially when juxtaposed with Donald Trump’s comments. The media’s tendency to cover Cruz’s actions with a critical lens evinces a larger pattern: the desire to contextualize political actors within black-and-white narratives, often devoid of nuance.

This practice of oversimplifying political discourse isn't limited to Cruz. A broader trend in media coverage reveals an alarming tendency of leading articles with dynamic headlines but relegating critical details to the final paragraphs. Such structure is particularly designed to cater to readers’ dwindling attention spans, effectively summarizing essential facts only to bury them in favor of capturing immediate interest. The implication is clear: vigilant readers must persist through the noise, interested in discerning meaning from a deluge of information often presented in misleading formats.

A lingering bias within the “liberal press” also complicates reader understanding. Many analyses are steeped in subjectivity, and this is neither secret nor unfounded. The burden falls upon the informed electorate to navigate the choppy waters of partisan reporting, extracting salient truths from within. Key statements from past leaders, notably Barack and Michelle Obama, regarding Hillary Clinton’s capabilities and character offer necessary context to assess her current candidacy. Voters are reminded to reflect upon previous endorsements and criticisms, now amplified by time, to fully understand her trajectory.

The irony in reintroducing the Daisy scenario in today’s context lies in the potential for an ad that ties factual underpinnings to criticisms of Clinton as opposed to drowning in emotional manipulation. An advertisement reflecting her track record—positioning her failures on the global stage alongside perceptions of her leadership—would align more accurately with the nuances of modern political engagement. Rather than echoing the emotional outrage of the original “Daisy” ad, a remake could instead arm voters with facts and contrast them against her political claims. 

Ultimately, what stands out is the profound shift in the political messaging landscape. Where once ads strove to incite fear through emotional resonance, the contemporary electorate may respond more favorably to engagements grounded in factual analysis and genuine dialogue. The political climate has changed; the actors may differ, but human behavior remains the same—the need for relatable, comprehensible content that aligns with voters’ lived experiences.

As the race heats up, we must remain cognizant of the historical precedents that inform our current reality. The legacy of the “Daisy” ad invites scrutiny, and now, more than ever, examining the implications of political strategies through the lens of history offers necessary insight. For those invested in the outcome of the upcoming presidential campaign, the lessons gleaned from 1964 could serve as crucial roadmaps. 

These opinions, while not necessarily reflective of mainstream publication views, bear witness to an evolving electoral landscape where familiarity with past tactics can be harnessed to anticipate the future. Informed and engaged readers stand the best chance of emerging from the noise with a clearer understanding of candidate realities, an imperative step in shaping a more cogent electorate in the face of emerging political narratives.",-18.0,10.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,915.0,0.29411764705882354,0.01092896174863388

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

Claims regarding President Barack Obama’s birth certificate have ignited fierce debate, with Democrats accusing critics of employing intimidation tactics against those questioning its legitimacy. Lynn Sweet, Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, recently appeared on Fox News, asserting that such inquiries are rooted in racism.

Sweet’s comments have sparked criticism over the validity of labeling skeptics as racist without thoroughly examining the substance of their allegations. Four significant points have been raised concerning the birth certificate’s authenticity. Critics argue that there is evidence to suggest it was altered. Furthermore, questions have emerged regarding Obama’s social security number, which was reportedly issued in Connecticut—an area where he has no known residency history. 

Additionally, the hospital cited on the birth certificate allegedly did not exist at the time the document was purportedly issued. Observers have noted that the birth certificate contains various inaccuracies that could potentially indicate falsification. 

Despite the contentious nature of these claims, no original birth certificate has been made public, prompting accusations of ""birther"" claims and racism, rather than addressing the substantive concerns raised by critics. As this debate continues, it remains crucial to discern between legitimate inquiry and unfounded allegations.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article criticizes the portrayal of Islam as a peaceful religion, referencing incidents of violence against LGBTQ+ individuals.

- It suggests tension between radical Islam and the gay community, emphasizing that they cannot coexist peacefully, as exemplified by Aaron Woods' experience.","**Rethinking the Narrative: Islam and Its Tension with the LGBTQ+ Community**

In recent years, the portrayal of Islam as a strictly peaceful religion has come under scrutiny, especially in light of violent incidents targeting LGBTQ+ individuals. The harsh realities faced by those in the gay community challenge the notion that all interpretations of Islam promote tolerance and acceptance.

A profound example of this conflict occurred in May 2016, when Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual from Eastbourne, suffered a brutal attack. Woods was confronted by an assailant who unleashed a tirade of homophobic slurs, culminating in a brutal punch that resulted in a broken jaw. Eyewitness Brian Markintosh reported that during the assault, the attacker invoked ""Muslim stuff,"" linking the violence to a broader narrative surrounding Islamic views on homosexuality.

Woods, described by friends as a gentle soul, endured not just physical pain but the psychological toll of such a vicious attack, which involved the use of a knuckleduster. This incident wasn't an isolated case; shortly after Woods' assault, another violent attack targeted a gay couple, signaling a worrying pattern of homophobic assaults linked to radical sentiments.

Sgt. Peter Allan mourned the hate directed at members of the LGBTQ+ community, expressing sadness over the homophobic nature of the assaults. However, he noted that the victims were on the path to recovery and that arrests were made in connection to the attacks. While law enforcement seeks to address these issues, the underlying ideological tensions remain.

This juxtaposition of the gay community's welcoming nature against the backdrop of Islamic doctrine reveals a disparity that cannot be overlooked. Under Sharia law, homosexuality is condemned and can be punishable by death— a stark contrast to the values of acceptance and inclusivity upheld by many in the LGBTQ+ community.

This growing tension raises questions about the relationship between radical ideologies and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. The experiences of victims like Aaron Woods illustrate a harsh reality: it is increasingly evident that radical interpretations of Islam and the pursuit of LGBTQ+ rights cannot coexist without conflict. Understanding this relationship is crucial as societies strive for inclusivity and safety for all individuals, highlighting the urgent need for dialogue and reconciliation in the face of such stark differences.",-26.0,-57.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,418.0,-3.5625,-0.13636363636363635
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

In a shocking incident that rattled the St. Cloud community, a man in a security uniform carried out a stabbing spree at a local mall, injuring nine shoppers before being shot dead by law enforcement. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant, unleashed the attack while reportedly shouting ""Allahu Akbar."" His actions raised urgent questions about security and the influence of extremist ideologies among immigrant communities.

Witnesses described a scene of chaos as Adan moved through the mall, engaging with victims prior to the stabbings. Notably, he asked at least one individual if they were Muslim before inflicting harm. This predilection for targeting victims based on their religious beliefs has drawn further attention to the motivations behind the attack.

Following the incident, members of the St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly recognized Adan as the perpetrator. Their recognition is significant, as it reflects the internal community struggle with individuals who may fall prey to terrorism and extremist ideologies. Community officials came forth expressing support for Adan’s family, portraying him as a good man and an accomplished student. This characterization stands in stark contrast to the violent actions he committed just hours earlier.

Adding to the complexity of the case, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting that Adan was a member of their organization. The group’s declaration not only underscores their influence over individuals but also raises alarms regarding the recruitment and radicalization of refugees and immigrants within the United States.

This incident is not an isolated occurrence but is part of a disturbing trend of violence linked to extremism in the U.S. A string of similar attacks, including a bombing at a Marine Corps race and an assault on New York police officers, have prompted increased scrutiny of security measures in public spaces. Concerns have grown around the potential for home-grown terrorism, particularly among Somali refugees, who have recently faced heightened threats from organizations like ISIS and Al-Shabab.

External threats have become tangible for those in the Somali community, especially in Minnesota, where the Mall of America has been singled out by Al-Shabab for targeted attacks. This persistent worry highlights the vulnerabilities that shopping centers and other public venues face, contributing to an atmosphere of fear among residents and law enforcement alike.

Moreover, the history of Somali-Americans engaging with terrorist networks has established a precedent for ongoing vigilance. Reports of threats affecting women in Minnesota signal an urgent need for protective measures as extremist groups exploit social issues to perpetuate violence. The vulnerability of this community only intensifies the need for stringent counter-terrorism efforts and public safety initiatives.

As discussions around the implications of this tragic incident continue, the spotlight also falls on political responses. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's controversial plans to substantially increase the number of Muslim refugees in the U.S. have drawn considerable criticism. Skeptics argue that such policies could inadvertently raise terrorism risks, given the growing number of individuals susceptible to radicalization. This skepticism is fueled by the belief that more immigrants from regions rife with extremist ideologies could challenge national security.

Many citizens believe that this ongoing immigration and potential influx of radicalized individuals could endanger public safety, and as such, there is a strong push to advocate for change in immigration policy. Supporters of Donald Trump have rallied around his campaign promises to tighten immigration controls, arguing that his leadership could help curb the threat of terrorism. They contend that Trump's approach would be a crucial step toward protecting American communities from the kinds of violence witnessed in St. Cloud.

This incident and its ramifications continue to resonate deeply within the St. Cloud community and beyond. While some community leaders express concern regarding the portrayal of Somali immigrants, particularly in the wake of such violence, there remains a palpable tension as communities grapple with the realities of extremism and the necessity for robust counter-measures.

Law enforcement's rapid response is being praised, particularly Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon Police Department, who fatally shot Adan and stopped the assault. The mayor of St. Cloud has labeled Falconer a hero for his role in preventing further injury and potential loss of life. This commendation reflects the importance of having trained personnel who can effectively respond to threats in high-stakes environments.

A broader conversation about the implications of terrorist activities that involve the Somali community is quickly brewing. The need for community engagement and proactive dialogue is essential in countering radicalization and ensuring a cohesive social fabric. It is imperative that immigrant communities feel supported while also being held accountable to the laws and societal norms of their new home.

As the events surrounding the St. Cloud attack unfold, the dual narrative of victim and perpetrator emerges, leaving the community wrestling with its implications. It serves as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by terrorism and the inherent responsibility to foster a culture of tolerance and understanding while recognizing the threats that persist. As the nation reflects on this tragedy, it must also consider the ways in which policy, community relations, and public safety must evolve in the face of such violence. The road ahead will undoubtedly require collaboration among all stakeholders to ensure effective prevention and support systems for those at risk of radicalization, ultimately leading to a safer society for all.",-72.0,-66.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,985.0,-1.4666666666666666,-0.06700507614213198
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

The notion of victimhood is a powerful theme that resonates deeply in contemporary societal discussions. Particularly within the millennial cohort, the pervasive label of the ""everyone gets a trophy generation"" reflects a broader discourse on entitlement, recognition, and the claims of victimization that have emerged in recent years. This notion begs many questions, especially as high-profile cases reveal the complex realities behind such claims.

One particularly striking case involves Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect behind the bombings in New Jersey and New York City. Prior to his arrest, Rahami articulated a sense of victimhood rooted in the experiences of what he described as ""Islamophobia."" This claim of being wronged based on his religious identity is reminiscent of broader discussions surrounding discrimination and the narratives that follow.

In 2011, Rahami and his father took legal action against the police in Elizabeth, NJ, alleging discrimination and selective enforcement directed toward them as Muslims. Their lawsuit, fueled by claims tied to their family-owned business, First American, positioned them as victims of systemic bias. The allegations included assertions of harassment stemming from complaints related to noise from their restaurant, illustrating how community tensions can intertwine with perceptions of discrimination.

Rahami’s family reportedly faced racial abuse from neighborhood members, which intensified their feelings of victimization. However, Mayor Christian Bollwage of Elizabeth refuted these claims, emphasizing that the issues involving the Rahami family predominantly stemmed from neighbor complaints rather than discriminatory motives from the authorities. 

Despite their intent to seek justice through the legal system, the Rahami family's lawsuit ultimately failed. This outcome led to a darker turn in Rahami's narrative; instead of being vindicated through lawful means, it appears he resorted to violence as a means of expression or retaliation. The trajectory from victimhood to violence raises serious concerns over the implications of such narratives and how they can spiral into catastrophic actions. 

Critics of the victimhood narrative assert that it fosters a sense of entitlement and can shift responsibility away from individual actions. Instead of fostering constructive dialogue or seeking legitimate avenues of redress, some may embolden themselves to see violence as a viable solution. The complexity of this narrative invites examination of deeper societal tenets, including how grievances are framed and the responses they elicit from individuals and communities alike.

In summary, Ahmad Khan Rahami’s case serves as a striking example of the evolving discourse surrounding victimhood as it intersects with law, community relations, and personal accountability. It invites a broader reflection on the implications of labeling individuals as victims and how that designation can potentially lead to drastic outcomes. Through examining such narratives, society may better understand the delicate balance between recognizing legitimate grievances and encouraging responsible, peaceful avenues for resolution.",-38.0,-31.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,522.0,-1.55,-0.05938697318007663
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically pressured Americans to vote in their favor, often leading to negative outcomes such as job outsourcing and stagnant wages.

In a political climate where corporations wield significant influence over employee voting choices, a concerning trend has emerged: employers pressuring their workers to cast ballots in favor of corporate interests. This dynamic has historically led to adverse consequences for American labor, including job outsourcing and stagnating wages.

One notable instance of corporate intimidation came during the previous presidential election when then-CEO “Papa” John Schnatter took a hard stance against the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to as Obamacare. Schnatter threatened to reduce employee hours and increase pizza prices if the ACA was not repealed. Ultimately, he did not follow through on these threats, yet the implications of such rhetoric reverberate throughout the workforce.

Currently, the atmosphere is no less charged with the political statements of corporate leaders like Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Puzder has made it clear that he harbors serious reservations about the economic policies of the Democratic Party. His message to employees is stark: under the leadership of a Democrat, the economy may suffer, and significant changes will be made within his company. 

One of Puzder’s most alarming statements revolves around his intentions to fully automate Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s restaurants should a Democrat win the election. This declaration underscores his disdain for what he perceives as increased labor costs that would ensue from progressive economic policies. Puzder has been vocal about his admiration for an automated restaurant model similar to that of Eatsa, a company that leverages technology to create efficiency at the expense of human employment.

Critically, Puzder has not held back in his critique of Democrats' efforts to push for higher minimum wages. He argues that elevating wage standards could be detrimental to job security for low-wage workers, framing the debate around minimum wage as one that could potentially lead to widespread job losses. This perspective raises eyebrows, particularly given that Puzder manages around 20,000 employees while advocating for measures that appear at odds with their economic wellbeing.

As he continues to influence votes among workers, Puzder’s advocacy for capitalism has come under scrutiny. He frequently writes on the merits of capitalism; however, there is doubt as to whether his employees share those sentiments, especially as they grapple with stagnant wages and the threat of automation. 

In 2012, Puzder reported earnings of nearly $4.5 million, suggesting a significant disconnect between corporate profits and employee compensation. Despite the increased financial success of his companies, the workers who contribute to that success see little to no benefit, raising questions about the sustainability of such a system. 

Whether or not Democratic candidates succeed in elections, Puzder's intentions regarding automation appear steadfast. He has signaled that he will prioritize profit margins over the welfare of his workforce, viewing technology as a means to streamline operations while reducing reliance on employees. 

The situation encapsulates a broader issue within the American corporate landscape, where the alignment of corporate interests with electoral politics places employees in a precarious position. Employees are often caught between the desire for upward mobility and the pressure to conform to their employer’s political preferences, which can lead to choices that may not align with their economic interests.

As workers navigate the complexities of voting in the shadow of their employers’ influence, the ongoing discourse surrounding automation, labor costs, and wage standards will likely intensify. The question remains: can the American workforce carve out their own political identity, or will they continue to be swayed by powerful corporate entities like Puzder's, whose agendas may not align with their best interests?",21.0,23.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,688.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03343023255813953
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a shocking development, the FBI has launched an investigation into new evidence concerning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's controversial use of a private email server. This inquiry comes in the wake of findings linked to a separate investigation involving Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former Congressman, who is now facing legal repercussions for sexting a minor. Notably, Weiner is the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a close aide to Clinton during her tenure at the State Department.

The connection between these investigations has sparked renewed scrutiny into Clinton’s handling of classified information. Central to the investigation is a laptop shared by Abedin and Weiner, which is believed to contain ""tens of thousands of emails"" from Abedin. Importantly, some of these emails may include communications that Abedin forwarded from Clinton's email account, emails that were never submitted to the FBI during previous inquiries.

The implications of this new evidence are grave. If the emails in question are determined to be work-related or classified, both Clinton and Abedin could potentially face prosecution for allegedly lying to the FBI—an offense that carries significant legal penalties. The discovery of this evidence marks a critical juncture, particularly given the timing of the FBI’s charges, surfacing just 11 days before a highly contentious election.

The background of this renewed investigation is steeped in contentious politics. On July 5, 2016, FBI Director James Comey publicly addressed the findings related to Clinton's use of a private email server, detailing evidence that pointed toward potential wrongdoing. However, Comey's ultimate decision not to recommend charges against Clinton left many within the FBI dissatisfied, leading to a sense of unrest among officials. Reports emerged of a consensus among high-ranking FBI officials advocating for Clinton to have her security clearance revoked and to face prosecution.

However, the situation has become even more complicated with the revelation of a 100-page summary released by the FBI, uncovering attempts by a State Department official to exert pressure on the agency concerning classified information related to Clinton’s emails. This exposure raised additional questions about the integrity of the investigation and the pressure applied to influence its outcomes.

Further complicating the narrative is the existence of a group of State Department officials dubbed ""The Shadow Government,"" who had been reportedly discussing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests concerning Clinton’s emails—a development that adds another layer of intrigue to the controversy. These actions suggest an effort within parts of the government to manage the fallout surrounding the scandal.

Adding fuel to the fire, documents released by Wikileaks revealed correspondence that suggested Clinton communicated directly with President Obama regarding the private server, contradicting her previous public assertions claiming that the President was unaware of her email practices. These revelations have deepened concerns over the extent of knowledge and communication within the highest levels of government concerning Clinton's decision to utilize a private email server for official business.

Among the most troubling allegations are those suggesting that Clinton herself intentionally deleted emails that could have been relevant to the ongoing investigations. This act raises significant questions about intent and whether such actions could have legal ramifications that might alter the course of the inquiry into her email practices.

The timeline surrounding these events indicates a concerted effort to sanitize the narrative surrounding Clinton’s email usage following increasing public scrutiny. As investigations unfolded and media attention intensified, actions to clarify or mitigate the perception of wrongdoing appeared to escalate, leading observers to question the motivations behind such maneuvers.

In addition to these allegations, concerns have also emerged regarding potential conflicts of interest stemming from alleged financial connections between Clinton's supporters and certain FBI officials. Such connections could lead to serious questions about the objectivity of the investigation into Clinton’s email practices and the integrity of the FBI’s decisions.

One of the more controversial figures in this saga is Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who received immunity for his role in deleting over 33,000 emails from Clinton’s private server. These emails reportedly contained sensitive information, including communications that could have involved the President. The decision to grant immunity raises additional questions about accountability and transparency in the investigation process.

As this complex and multifaceted situation continues to evolve, the narrative suggests a disturbing possibility of collusion among various parties. Reports have emerged implying potential coordination between the White House, mainstream media outlets, and the Clinton campaign aimed at shielding Clinton from accountability and protecting sensitive information, specifically regarding the contents of the emails that were deleted.

In conclusion, the resurfacing of these allegations and new evidence surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server points to a protracted legal and political battle that is far from over. As the FBI delves deeper into the implications of these findings, the ramifications could extend beyond individual accountability to encompass broader questions about the integrity of political institutions and the interplay between power, media, and personal conduct in American politics. As this story unfolds, it is likely to remain at the forefront of national discourse and media attention, shaping opinions and political landscapes in the months to come.",-6.0,-28.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,956.0,-0.8484848484848485,-0.029288702928870293
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In a significant political shift, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, once a staunch advocate for an open borders policy concerning Syrian refugees, now finds herself facing mounting criticism and regret over her administration's handling of the migrant crisis. The influx of refugees has not only transformed the country's demographics but has also been linked to a noticeable uptick in crime, including thousands of reported sexual assaults and violent incidents across German cities. 

This discord among the populace culminated in a drastic political shift as voters chose to oust Merkel's conservative Democrat party by a substantial margin in recent elections. The vote was seen as a direct response to both the challenges posed by an accelerated wave of migration and the public's growing frustration with crime rates associated with the increases.

In her post-election comments, Merkel expressed remorse over her past policies, suggesting that the scale of the migrant crisis could have been avoided. During a party conference, she characterized the notion of multiculturalism as a “living lie,” acknowledging the backlash her administration faced. This new perspective marks a stark contrast to her previous open-door stance, signaling a pivotal shift in her approach to dealing with the challenges of immigration.

Merkel went on to admit the difficulties of managing the current influx of migrants, outlining the necessity for Germany to regain control over its migration policies. She astutely noted that the country could only manage the situation by reducing the number of incoming refugees while carefully dancing around the topic of setting a specific cap on arrivals. This nuanced characterization reflects an awareness of the complexities surrounding the issue, suggesting that a blanket approach may no longer be viable. 

Furthermore, Merkel stressed the importance of a regulated migration process that considers not just German interests, but also broader European and global contexts. Her call for a limited and well-managed approach highlights the challenge of balancing humanitarian responsibilities with national security concerns.

As Germany navigates this contentious period, experts warn that the repercussions of such dynamics could also echo across the Atlantic, posing similar challenges for American leaders if they fail to acknowledge their role in addressing the unfolding crisis.",-2.0,-37.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,407.0,-2.8461538461538463,-0.09090909090909091
Fake_36-Webpage,"DISGUSTING! Because Of Hillary & Obama, NY Terrorist Will Get Better Treatment Than US Vets! ⋆ Freedom Daily","8.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology.

A recent outcry has arisen over the apparent disparity in medical care afforded to a terrorist who planted explosives in New Jersey and New York City, compared to the treatment that U.S. veterans receive. Criticism has intensified, particularly regarding the ongoing struggles within the Veterans Administration (VA), which has been plagued by inefficiencies and scandals, notably one that emerged in 2014 involving long waiting lists for care.

In a pointed campaign speech, former President Donald Trump articulated his concerns about the situation, highlighting the irony that a terrorist would receive better medical attention than the veterans who fought for the country. Trump commended law enforcement for apprehending the suspect but expressed dismay over the quality of medical care the terrorist is set to receive. He pointedly stated that this individual would have access to top doctors, modern hospital facilities, and a solid legal defense, raising alarms about the values inherent in the healthcare system.

The frustrations expressed in Trump’s speech resonate with many, especially those who underscore the monumental challenges veterans face within the VA system. Over 300,000 veterans have tragically passed away while waiting for the services and healthcare they earned through their service. The disparity has deepened into a national concern as statistics show that veterans, facing delays and bureaucratic hurdles, have resorted to desperate measures, with many committing suicide while awaiting care.

This alarming trend places the spotlight on a healthcare system that appears to prioritize the needs of a convicted terrorist over individuals who have dedicated their lives to serving and protecting the nation. The author highlights the empathy and commitment that veterans deserve, urging for a reevaluation of health services to ensure that those who defended the country are not left languishing in a system fraught with inefficiencies.

The juxtaposition of medical care for a terrorist versus that of veterans raises critical questions about the nation’s values and priorities. With Trump’s remarks serving as a wake-up call, it is clear that the focus must shift to rectify this imbalance. The call for reforms to the VA system has never been more urgent, as veterans continue to await the quality of care that should be their right, not a privilege.

As the nation grapples with these profound issues, advocates and citizens alike are left wondering when the healthcare system will shift to reflect proper respect and acknowledgment for those who have served their country, rather than allowing the needs of a terrorist to overshadow the sacrifice of veterans.",13.0,-1.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,466.0,-0.06666666666666667,-0.002145922746781116
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more.

In a startling act of bravery, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, intervened in a violent stabbing attack in St. Cloud, Minnesota, saving the lives of eight victims by shooting an ISIS terrorist who was assaulting them. This courageous decision has marked Falconer as a local hero and has prompted a national conversation about self-defense rights and gun ownership.

Falconer is the owner of Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., a business dedicated to educating citizens about firearm safety and self-defense techniques. His operation emphasizes the importance of being prepared and responsible when it comes to firearm usage, fueling the belief among many that self-defense is a fundamental right that should be upheld.

However, this episode of heroism is set against a backdrop of political contention, particularly with the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. Clinton has openly expressed her intention to target Falconer's business should she be elected, aiming to dismantle the entity that empowers individuals like Falconer to take charge of their own safety. Critics argue that Clinton’s stance represents a broader anti-gun agenda that threatens not only Falconer’s business but also the rights of countless citizens who advocate for self-defense.

Central to Clinton's proposed approach is her disdain for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which affords legal protections to firearms manufacturers and dealers. By seeking to eliminate this law, Clinton positions herself against the very framework that underpins businesses like Falconer’s, placing them in jeopardy and jeopardizing their right to operate freely within the parameters of existing legislation.

Falconer, dedicated to protecting citizens and providing firearms training, perceives Clinton's position as a direct affront to the Second Amendment rights. His mission aligns with the notion that self-defense is a paramount consideration in today's society, especially in the face of threats like the one he faced in St. Cloud. The ideological clash between Falconer’s advocacy for responsible gun ownership and Clinton's ambitions has ignited passionate responses.

Supporters of Falconer and those who value Second Amendment rights are urging the public to stand against Clinton’s vision. They contend that individuals dedicated to safeguarding their communities—like Falconer—should be celebrated, not punished. The narrative suggests that rather than vilifying those who take steps to enhance public safety, there should be a recognition of their contributions in perilous situations.

The implications of this political battle extend beyond Falconer's personal business to encompass a wider discourse on firearm rights in America. Advocates for gun rights are rallying together, highlighting the necessity to defend individuals who stand against forces that threaten their freedoms. The conversation is shifting to emphasize the importance of rallying behind those who actively contribute to the sense of security that the community relies upon.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the tension surrounding gun rights continues to escalate. Citizens delving into these issues must consider the broader ramifications of supporting candidates whose policies may jeopardize the very freedoms that individuals like Jason Falconer epitomize.

In the midst of this polarized climate, Falconer’s story serves as a vital reminder of the heroism that exists within the community. Authorities implore citizens to back those who protect their rights to self-defense and engage in discussions that honor the spirit of resilience and responsibility.

The unfolding political landscape offers a critical opportunity for discourse on self-defense, gun rights, and the implications of legislative change in shaping the future security of American citizens. The decision over whether to support candidates who endorse policies that could threaten these rights will rest firmly in the hands of the electorate.",-11.0,31.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,674.0,1.1481481481481481,0.04599406528189911
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the 2024 presidential election cycle heats up, discussions surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's health have become a dominant theme in both media coverage and voter sentiment. Recent polling data reveals that the public's perception of Clinton's health has taken a notable downturn, prompting new rounds of speculation and concern from the electorate.

A recent poll indicated that over 40% of registered voters now view Clinton's health as ""below average"" or ""very poor,"" a substantial increase from just 26% in late August. In contrast, only 28% of those surveyed considered her health to be ""average,"" while a mere 22% rated it as ""above average"" or ""excellent."" This shift in public opinion underscores the growing anxiety surrounding the candidate as she embarks on her campaign efforts.

At 68 years old, Clinton's appearance has drawn scrutiny, with many observers remarking that she appears older than her age. This perception, coupled with widespread awareness of her potential medical issues—approximately 80% of poll respondents acknowledge these concerns—has fueled ongoing speculation regarding her fitness for office.

Fueling these worries are rumors and reports suggesting that Clinton is taking Coumadin, an anticoagulant drug often prescribed for individuals with serious medical conditions. Additionally, there are claims that she has been researching Provigil, a medication commonly used to treat conditions such as narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Such revelations have stoked fears among voters and raised questions about her ability to handle the rigors of a presidential campaign.

Reports from those close to Clinton suggest an even more intimate landscape of health concerns, with her assistant allegedly mentioning her need for naps and experiencing episodes of confusion. These accounts spotlights a potential struggle for the former First Lady as she navigates both the physical challenges of campaigning and her public image.

Moreover, the public has pointed to various incidents where Clinton appeared physically unwell or required assistance, further intensifying speculation. Notable among these moments was her attendance at the 9/11 Memorial, during which onlookers raised alarms about her demeanor. Interestingly, it has been reported that videos documenting these health-related incidents have been removed from the internet, leading to further questions about transparency surrounding her health.

Observers have also suggested that Clinton's campaign strategy may be inadvertently correlating with the growing concerns about her health. Low attendance at her rallies has been hinted at as a possible tactic to minimize public exposure to her condition, thereby controlling the narrative surrounding her campaign. This strategy raises apprehensions among voters, as many believe a candidate's health plays a crucial role in their capacity to serve effectively.

Adding to the discourse on Clinton's health are reports of her persistent coughing during public speeches. This recurring issue has not only captured media attention but has also led to heightened public scrutiny about her overall well-being. Such symptoms have added to the growing narrative questioning whether she is physically equipped to endure the rigors of the presidency.

In contrast, former President Donald Trump's perceived health appears to have improved slightly during the same timeframe. Positive assessments of Trump's health have risen from 33% to 36%, further highlighting the divergence between public sentiment concerning the two candidates. While Clinton’s health concerns have gained significant traction, Trump's perceived health remains relatively stable, allowing him to present a stronger front to voters.

As the election primaries draw closer, the impact of these health-related perceptions on Clinton's campaign remains to be seen. The importance of public perception of a candidate's fitness for office cannot be underestimated, especially for a position as demanding as the presidency. Voters often weigh a candidate's health as a reflection of their capability to govern effectively and to manage the stress of that role.

With more than a year left until the election, it is likely that discussions surrounding Clinton's health will continue to dominate the political landscape. As Clinton actively seeks to communicate her vision and agenda to voters, addressing these health concerns may become a formidable challenge. The stakes are high, and the outcome may hinge not only on her policy positions but also on the electorate's confidence in her physical readiness to serve as president. 

As the election cycle unfolds, the interplay between health perceptions and public trust will undoubtedly shape the pathway to the 2024 presidential race.",-11.0,22.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,822.0,0.7096774193548387,0.0267639902676399

Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

- The book claims to reveal Hillary's harsh treatment of those beneath her and her ambition for the presidency.
- Kyle details her personal history with Bill Clinton, dating him through high school and their sexual relationship post-graduation.
- She recounts an incident where Hillary Clinton expressed frustration over developmentally challenged children at an Easter egg hunt, using derogatory language.
- Hillary is portrayed as looking down on the people of Arkansas, whom she considered ""ignorant hillbillies.""
- Raised in a middle-class suburb of Illinois, Hillary is depicted as feeling superior to the local population, only aligning with them when politically convenient.
- Bill Clinton chose not to run for reelection in 1990 as they were both tired of the constraints of Arkansas life, focusing instead on future presidential aspirations.","In a move that has stirred significant controversy, Dolly Kyle has unveiled her much-anticipated book, *Hillary: The Other Woman*, which promises to expose alleged truths about former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton. The narrative claims to shed light on Hillary’s purportedly harsh treatment of those around her and her unwavering ambition for the presidency.

Kyle, who has a long and intricate history with Bill Clinton, reminisces about their relationship, which began during high school and extended into a sexual liaison post-graduation. Through her personal anecdotes, Kyle offers readers a glimpse into the dynamics of the Clinton relationship as well as the broader implications of their ambitions.

Among the more shocking revelations in the book is an incident involving a derisive comment allegedly made by Hillary Clinton at an Easter egg hunt concerning developmentally challenged children. Kyle recounts Hillary expressing frustration and using derogatory language in reference to the children, suggesting a stark disconnect between the former First Lady and the families she was meant to connect with.

Additionally, Kyle describes Hillary’s perceived disdain for the people of Arkansas, whom she reportedly viewed as “ignorant hillbillies.” Raised in a middle-class suburb of Illinois, the narrative suggests that Hillary harbored feelings of superiority over the local population, only engaging with them politically when it served her interests.

The book also touches on pivotal moments in the Clintons' political journey, including Bill Clinton’s decision not to seek reelection in 1990. Both he and Hillary are depicted as weary of the constraints that life in Arkansas imposed upon their ambitions, subsequently pivoting their focus towards future presidential aspirations.

As the book sparks heated discussions and debates, it raises questions about the private lives of powerful political figures and their public personas.",-10.0,-9.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,328.0,-0.9,-0.027439024390243903

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

A recent ruling by a judge in Massachusetts has set the stage for a contentious debate regarding public safety and the relationship between law enforcement and black males in the state. The decision, which stems from a newly enacted law addressing the concerns of black Americans regarding police interactions, cannot be appealed following a previous Supreme Court ruling. This legal position has raised significant eyebrows among community leaders, law enforcement, and residents alike.

At the heart of the matter is a profound concern: the instinctual flight response some black individuals experience when confronted by police officers. Acknowledging this fear, the ruling allows individuals who perceive themselves as being ""disproportionately"" targeted to flee from police without facing legal penalties—a marked shift from previous legal standards. Under the older statutes, running from law enforcement could lead to reasonable suspicion and potential detention for investigative purposes. 

This law, while intended as a remedy for ingrained fears within segments of the black community, has prompted questions regarding its implications for public safety in Massachusetts. Critics worry that the ruling could undermine the effectiveness of police work, limiting officers’ ability to pursue individuals suspected of criminal activities. The skepticism surrounding this ruling stems from its potential to erode the parameters of police engagement and further complicate the already perilous nature of police work.

It is essential to understand the inherent dangers that police officers face daily. The intricacies of law enforcement require quick decision-making and an ability to navigate increasingly volatile situations. Civilians often cannot fully comprehend the challenges and pressures faced by officers tasked with protecting public safety. Assertions have been made that an increasing divide may form between police and communities, particularly if officers are hampered in their ability to pursue individuals evading law enforcement. 

This latest ruling by the Massachusetts judge encapsulates a broader societal dilemma: how to balance the fears and legitimate concerns of marginalized communities while ensuring public safety and effective law enforcement. As Massachusetts grapples with this new legal landscape, community leaders and police departments will likely need to engage in substantial dialogue to bridge the understanding gap that exists.

The implications of this ruling are yet to be fully realized, and as the conversation unfolds, stakeholders will be keenly watching how this law affects police-community relations and overall public safety. The author expresses skepticism about whether this can be deemed an effective solution to the complexities of policing amidst community fears. As discussions progress, it will be crucial to evaluate the overarching impacts and determine if the intended objectives of greater safety and trust can indeed be achieved in the evolving landscape of Massachusetts law.",-13.0,17.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,489.0,0.9444444444444444,0.034764826175869123
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Sansaricq's statements come in the wake of continuing struggles faced by the Haitian population, particularly in the aftermath of the devastating 2010 earthquake.

In his condemnation, Sansaricq alleged that the foundation failed to provide adequate assistance to Haiti, arguing that corruption delayed the delivery of essential aid. He pointed out that despite billions in donations directed towards the Clinton Foundation, many Haitians are still living in tents and enduring severe hardships. He accused the Clintons of exploiting the disaster for their personal benefit, emphasizing that the foundation's leaders became wealthier while the Haitian populace remained in desperate conditions.

Sansaricq also called for greater transparency regarding the financial aid provided to Haiti, questioning the reasons behind the failure to deliver help effectively. He made a jarring claim that he was offered a bribe by Bill Clinton, which he declined, leading to the revocation of his visa.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid disclosure, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed deep regrets over her open migrant policy, acknowledging that she would opt for a different approach if given the chance. This revelation comes on the heels of a significant electoral defeat for her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a loss Merkel attributes, in part, to the growing anti-migrant sentiment across Germany.

Merkel articulated the pressing need for a reevaluation of her strategies concerning refugee issues. “If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015,” she stated, reflecting on the challenges that arose during the height of the crisis when she allowed a substantial influx of asylum seekers into Germany.

The recent election outcomes, which saw an increase in seats for the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD), have compelled Merkel to take full responsibility for the CDU's disappointing results. “The party's poor performance was influenced by the criticisms and rise of AfD, pushing anti-mass migration narratives into the spotlight,” she acknowledged.

Despite her introspection and acknowledgment of rising discontent, Merkel downplayed the possibility of overhauling her existing policies. She firmly dismissed suggestions from members of the Christian Social Union (CSU) to impose a cap of 200,000 migrants annually and to prioritize Christian migrants over their Muslim counterparts. Her resistance stems from a commitment to the party’s principles and a dedication to upholding Germany's core values, which she believes are rooted in non-discrimination based on religion. “Discrimination based on religion contradicts our party principles and what Germany stands for,” she emphasized.

The context of rising anti-migrant sentiment is not without reason, as it is closely tied to public perceptions of increased terrorism and violent crime linked to incoming refugees. These concerns have fueled anxiety amongst a segment of the German populace and have contributed to the growing support for parties that espouse strict immigration policies.

Returning to the complicated dynamic within Merkel's coalition, tensions have long existed between her CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU. In 2017, CSU leader Horst Seehofer issued a stern warning, threatening to withdraw support for Merkel unless she addressed the contentious issue of a migrant cap. Seehofer underscored the necessity for the coalition to find common ground as they approach future federal elections, a sentiment that remains resonant as political discussions heat up again.

Analysts are closely monitoring Merkel’s political future as she navigates the fallout from her controversial refugee policies. With increasing skepticism from the electorate and a potential shift in the political landscape, the chancellor faces myriad challenges leading into the forthcoming elections. 

Merkel’s reflections on the form and impact of her migrant policies indicate a significant moment of reckoning. As the political climate shifts and public opinion takes stock of Germany’s experience with migration, the chancellor’s earlier decisions now lay at the center of critical discussions surrounding national identity, security, and humanitarian responsibilities. Whether her government can effectively reconcile these competing interests remains an open question in the eyes of voters, analysts, and international observers.",-14.0,-19.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,593.0,-0.95,-0.03204047217537943
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In a troubling incident that has drawn attention in Sundsvall, Sweden, Abdullah, a Somali Muslim asylum seeker, is facing serious allegations following a violent assault on his pregnant wife. This event marks a continuation of Abdullah’s disturbing history of violent crimes, which includes past offenses related to assaults and molestations. 

The incident occurred after Abdullah returned home from a night out with friends. Prior to his arrival, he had expressed clear demands to his wife regarding her niece, who was in her care at the time. Abdullah instructed his wife to ensure that the niece was removed before he returned home. However, upon discovering that the niece was still present, Abdullah reacted with extreme violence, physically assaulting his wife and inflicting serious harm by kicking her in the head and stomach.

The assault did not stop there. In a further act of humiliation, Abdullah poured beer over his wife and urinated on her, escalating an already troubling situation into one that has shocked the community. The details of this incident have raised significant concerns regarding Abdullah’s behavior and his adherence to principles meant to guide marital relations within the context of his faith.

The incident also raises critical conversations surrounding interpretations of religious texts, specifically referencing Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. Such interpretations have come under scrutiny, particularly when juxtaposed with actions such as Abdullah’s, which appear to contradict the very tenets he attempts to justify his behavior through. The author of the article expresses disbelief over Abdullah’s simultaneous consumption of alcohol and his violent adherence to a selective interpretation of religious teachings—contradictions that continue to perplex those observing the unfolding situation.

Since his arrival in Sweden five years ago, Abdullah has relied on welfare benefits, which has raised questions about his integration into Swedish society. His ongoing history of violent behavior, coupled with this recent incident, has ignited conversations on asylum policies and the challenges posed by individuals harboring violent tendencies.

The local community and law enforcement are grappling with the implications of this case on broader discussions regarding domestic violence and the challenges faced by asylum seekers. As authorities investigate, there is a call for reflection on the support systems available to victims of domestic violence, particularly those who may feel trapped in abusive relationships due to cultural or religious expectations.

Abdullah’s case is a stark reminder of the complexities and difficulties that can arise within immigrant communities, emphasizing the importance of addressing not only the actions of individuals but the systemic issues that allow such behaviors to persist. As the legal proceedings move forward, many will be watching closely to see how this case unfolds and what measures may be implemented to prevent further incidents of domestic violence.",-28.0,-54.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,519.0,-3.0,-0.10404624277456648
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked widespread concern among voting rights advocates, Pennsylvania Republicans are pushing forward with House Bill 29, a proposal that could permit voter intimidation on Election Day. The bill aims for immediate implementation, allowing outside individuals to closely monitor polling places in non-residential districts and challenge the eligibility of voters, potentially disrupting the electoral process.

Critics, including Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice, have voiced strong opposition to the bill, warning of its potential ramifications. Gitlin suggests that the legislation could pave the way for discriminatory challenges based on race or religion, disproportionately affecting minority communities and leading to longer lines at polling stations. This outcome could discourage eligible voters from casting their ballots, undermining the very foundation of democracy.

The proposed bill appears to align closely with rhetoric previously expressed by former President Donald Trump. In his ongoing claims of widespread voter fraud, Trump has encouraged his supporters to monitor polling areas closely, asserting that the electoral process is rigged against him. By promoting an atmosphere of suspicion around the integrity of the election, Trump is pushing for a framework that allows for increased scrutiny on voters who may be perceived as suspicious.

Through his website, Trump has actively solicited support for poll watchers, framing the upcoming election in adversarial terms. The immediate effectiveness of House Bill 29, should it be enacted, could serve as a crucial element in Trump's electoral strategy, particularly in a battleground state like Pennsylvania, where the race is considered closely contested.

An amendment to the bill proposes that it would take effect as soon as it is signed into law, circumventing the usual 60-day waiting period that follows the passage of legislation. Advocates for the bill argue that this swift implementation is necessary to ensure a fair electoral process, marking a shift towards aggressive measures that could fundamentally alter the dynamics of voting in the state.

The implications of this bill extend beyond Pennsylvania’s borders. If the proposed measure proves effective in facilitating voter intimidation tactics during the election, it could set a precedent for similar legislation in other states. The ripple effects of this initiative could be felt nationwide, particularly in key districts where voter turnout is paramount to electoral success.

As the debate surrounding House Bill 29 intensifies, it is evident that the issue of voter intimidation remains a polarizing and critical topic. Advocates champion the right to vote without fear of harassment or intimidation, while supporters of the bill argue for increased oversight to safeguard the electoral process.

With Election Day rapidly approaching, Pennsylvanians find themselves at a crossroads. The proposed legislation has raised alarms over the integrity and accessibility of the voting process. As government officials and voters alike brace for a contentious political landscape, the outcome of the upcoming election could hinge on the effectiveness and enforcement of laws that dictate the terms under which citizens can exercise their right to vote.

The ramifications of House Bill 29 will likely continue to reverberate as the state moves toward the election, prompting intense scrutiny from both sides of the political spectrum as they grapple with the fundamental principles of democracy and electoral integrity.",-19.0,-1.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,595.0,-0.047619047619047616,-0.0016806722689075631

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, the pioneering American Olympian fencer known for being the first to compete in the Olympics wearing a hijab, has opened up about her feelings of insecurity while living in the United States. In a recent interview, she recounted a troubling incident in which she was followed home from practice, leading her to harbor fears about being reported to the police.

Despite sharing her difficult experiences, Muhammad was quick to contextualize her feelings within the broader landscape of racial tensions in America. She acknowledged that, while her own encounters with insecurity are challenging, they are not comparable to the more severe instances of racism and violence faced by others. She pointed out recent high-profile incidents, including a shooting in North Carolina and the mistreatment of the Khan family, highlighting the systemic issues that persist in the nation.

However, an article critiquing her perspective suggests a counter-narrative to her claims. By noting the rising rates of hate crimes against Jewish individuals, the author challenges the assertion that America is a flagrant ""Islamophobic"" country. This leads to further questions regarding Muhammad's place and comfort within the country. The author provocatively raises the point of why she wouldn’t consider relocating to a Muslim-majority country if she finds life in the U.S. intolerable. Such a move, they imply, may expose her to even harsher conditions often reported in those nations.

The article contrasts her situation in America with the potential threats that individuals may face in Muslim-majority countries, suggesting that the freedoms and opportunities available to her in the U.S. are not universally accessible elsewhere. This frame of reference raises a thought-provoking argument on the complexities of identity, belonging, and the varying societal structures around the world.

As discussions continue about race, identity, and safety in America, Muhammad's experiences serve as a crucial reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by marginalized communities, while also posing questions about perceptions of safety and the societal frameworks individuals navigate.",-23.0,-14.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,377.0,-1.0769230769230769,-0.03713527851458886
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

CHARLOTTE, NC – What began as a peaceful protest in Charlotte following the shooting of a black man by a black police officer rapidly escalated into a series of violent riots that have drawn national attention. The situation has sparked not only concern over public safety but also critical reflections on the motivations and behaviors of those involved in the unrest.

As tensions flared in the streets, many were quick to voice their discontent with the actions of the rioters, who appeared to have descended into chaos without a coherent motive. The irony of the situation, where both the victim and the officer were members of the same racial group, raises pressing questions about the legitimacy and focus of the protests. Rather than fostering community solidarity, the actions of these individuals led to disorder, overshadowing the original intent of advocating for justice and reform.

Among the more distressing incidents reported during the hostile demonstrations was the mockery directed at injured police officers. Such disrespectful behavior not only undermines the gravity of the protests but also alienates members of the community who may feel sympathetic towards both the victims and the law enforcement officers. By engaging in such actions, protestors seem to forget that respect and empathy should be fundamental in any dialogue surrounding social justice.

The portrayal of the rioters as irresponsible and disconnected from the workforce raises significant concerns about societal values. It appears some took to the streets not merely to express their grievances but to engage in acts that serve only to exacerbate tensions. This behavior casts a shadow over any valid concerns that might arise from the unfortunate shooting incident, suggesting that the protests are less about the value of black lives and more about chaos and violence within the community.

At its core, the rioting reflects a deeper issue, one that begs the question: Are these protests indicative of a genuine movement advocating for the value of black lives, or do they instead reveal a troubling pattern of upheaval fueled by frustration and division? It is difficult to reconcile the claim that black lives matter when violent confrontations escalate within the very community that seeks to promote that value.

Critics of the demonstrations have expressed strong disdain for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporters, asserting that their actions contribute to a larger narrative of violence and discontent. Accusations of being uneducated and misguided add another layer to the debate, perpetuating a cycle of resentment that may further alienate potential allies. The behavior exhibited by some demonstrators suggests a disregard for the message they seek to convey, ultimately tarnishing the reputation of the broader black community.

In reflecting on these events, it becomes clear that racial identity should not inform judgments of people’s actions. Each individual must be held accountable for their behavior, regardless of their racial background. The current state of affairs reminds us that true progress towards the value of black lives should involve introspection and accountability from all corners of the community, rather than a blinding allegiance to a movement that may not reflect the more thoughtful and productive elements of dialogue.

As Charlotte grapples with these recent events, it is essential for all involved to reflect on the principles that underpin justice and community. Engaging in destructive behavior not only undermines the legitimacy of the cause but risks further deepening divides within the community. While the outrage surrounding the shooting is undeniably valid, translating that emotion into respect, dialogue, and actionable change should be the priority moving forward.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a poignant reminder: the fight for equality and justice must be rooted in respect and accountability, rather than chaos and violence. Moving beyond mere protests, the challenge remains to cultivate a community dialogue that truly reflects the values of understanding, empathy, and mutual respect. Ultimately, a unified effort is needed to heal the divisions and truly affirm the value of black lives, rather than allowing misdirected anger to reign supreme.",-83.0,-44.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,737.0,-1.76,-0.05970149253731343
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In his final address to the United Nations General Assembly as President, Barack Obama underscored his position as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal. The President, known for his advocacy of transformative policies such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and increased acceptance of refugees, conveyed a vision for a one-world order of international governance and law.

During his speech, Obama suggested that for the United States to effectively contribute to global security, it may be necessary to sacrifice certain domestic freedoms. He argued that international institutions like the United Nations could play a pivotal role in achieving this security. While the notion of sacrificing freedoms for the greater good has raised eyebrows among Americans, the President asserted that the fundamental right to self-defense should remain untouchable.

Despite acknowledging the criticism he faces from fellow Americans concerning his views, Obama maintained his stance, reflecting a belief that a more integrated global framework is essential in addressing contemporary challenges. His remarks have drawn mixed reactions, with some applauding his commitment to global collaboration while others perceive his approach as indicative of arrogance and an unwillingness to compromise.

Critics have highlighted the divisiveness that characterizes Washington D.C. today, attributing part of this polarization to Obama’s progressive agenda. The tension between his ideals and the conservative elements within the country has become a focal point of political discourse. While Obama champions a future where collective international action prevails, detractors argue that this perspective alienates those who prioritize national sovereignty and individual freedoms.

Ultimately, Obama’s final UN speech has reignited the debate on the balance between global cooperation and national autonomy. As President, he has faced persistent challenges in garnering bipartisan support for his vision, raising questions about the future of American leadership on the global stage. As his presidency draws to a close, the implications of his policies and rhetoric will likely resonate for years to come.",13.0,32.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,363.0,2.4615384615384617,0.0881542699724518
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of the NFL, two names have recently dominated headlines: Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. Both men, once starting quarterbacks, now find themselves in similar situations as pivotally important figures for different reasons. While Tebow is celebrated for his high-class reputation and positive image, Kaepernick has seen his name associated with controversy and criticism.

Tim Tebow has built a legacy based on hard work, faith, and dedication. His approach to professional sports has permitted him to maintain a largely positive reputation, driven by his commitment to excellence on and off the field. When discussing Kaepernick’s National Anthem protest, Tebow has kept his remarks limited, emphasizing that expressing one’s beliefs is commendable when done appropriately. Tebow’s moderate stance reflects a philosophy that encourages dialogue without diving into the murky waters of division.

Conversely, Kaepernick has faced significant backlash for his decision to kneel during the National Anthem, a protest aimed at drawing attention to issues of racial inequality and social injustice. Critics argue that as a highly-paid bench player, Kaepernick has disrespected the fans and the game, prompting many to question his motives. The author of this article takes a firm stance against Kaepernick, suggesting that protests in the context of sporting events compromise the very essence of the games that unite fans across the country.

The author's perspective encompasses a broader critique of perceived oppression in America. Assertively, it is claimed that no one in America is oppressed, framing allegations of oppression as excuses for laziness and lack of effort. The article argues that such claims are unfounded, providing the presidency of Barack Obama as a key piece of evidence to support the assertion that opportunities are widely accessible in today’s society.

In stark contrast to Kaepernick's turbulent narrative, the article portrays Tim Tebow as someone who skillfully avoids negative press. His recent endeavors, particularly in professional baseball with the New York Mets, are met with optimism. The author expresses a sincere hope for Tebow's success, appreciating his positive contributions to both sports and society.

The ongoing tension between these two public figures underscores deeper societal divides regarding activism and sports. While Tebow is lauded for his integrity and work ethic, Kaepernick remains a polarizing figure whose actions have invoked strong negative sentiments. The article serves not only as an exploration of these two men's careers but also as a reflection of current cultural conversations surrounding sports, activism, and the notion of respect in modern America. As these narratives continue to unfold, the stark contrast between Tebow and Kaepernick epitomizes the profound complexities in the intersection of sports and social issues.",-6.0,7.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,504.0,0.35,0.013888888888888888
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

In the ongoing discussion surrounding national security, the construction and maintenance of a border wall has emerged as a critical measure transcending the conventional narrative of controlling illegal immigration. This initiative echoes the historical significance of structures like China's Great Wall, which was originally erected to protect against foreign invaders.

Current security concerns are further exacerbated by the influence of drug cartels operating in Mexico. Their level of violence has drawn unsettling parallels to terrorist organizations like ISIS. With an unsecured Southern Border, experts warn that this could potentially become an entry point for ISIS operatives, posing an even greater threat to the United States.

A recent incident has highlighted these fears: eight nationals from Syria attempted to illegally cross into the U.S. from Mexico and were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. This incident has added to an atmosphere of apprehension, with federal agents reporting heightened security concerns following the Paris terror attacks. National Border Patrol Council President Hector Garza has echoed these sentiments, stating that agents are increasingly alarmed by the potential security risks.

Garza also pointed out a troubling reality: a significant number of illegal entrants are not being deported, complicating the already challenging task of maintaining national security. This lack of action creates vulnerabilities that could facilitate the entry of individuals with malign intentions.

In light of these circumstances, there is a growing call for stronger border security measures and robust support for the efforts of border patrol agents. Public and political discourse is increasingly focused on these critical security issues, with constituents demanding a proactive approach to safeguard the nation.

Amidst this climate of urgency, one presidential candidate has been notably vocal about addressing the challenges of border security. This candidate has drawn attention as the sole individual willing to tackle the complexities of securing the Southern Border, promising comprehensive strategies that account for both immigration control and national safety.

As the debate continues, the intersection of effective border security and national defense takes center stage, reminding policymakers and the public alike of the imperatives that such measures entail. The quest for a secure nation, in a time fraught with uncertainty, demands unwavering commitment and immediate action from those in leadership positions.",-13.0,-7.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,418.0,-0.4375,-0.01674641148325359

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

In a recent event, Haitians expressed strong support for former President Donald Trump, applauding him fervently as they shared their personal stories. This notable show of backing came amidst a growing discontent aimed at the Clintons, with audience members criticizing their handling of Haitian aid funds. 

Attendees voiced their anger over claims that the Clintons disappeared after receiving generous donations meant for Haiti’s recovery. Comments pointed toward alleged mismanagement of those funds, with accusations that aid money has benefited Washington lobbyists rather than the Haitian people in dire need. 

Moreover, the audience specifically targeted Hillary Clinton, accusing her of obstructing efforts to raise the daily minimum wage in Haiti from $3 to $5. The critiques intensified as the atmosphere shifted against the Clintons, prompting some media personnel to leave the venue prematurely. 

Their departure raised eyebrows, as many observers perceived it as an attempt to evade covering a narrative that ran counter to their established portrayal of Trump. Critics noted that the media missed a significant moment by not remaining to hear the audience's comments, which could have offered a compelling perspective rooted in the real experiences of Haitian citizens. 

By leaving early when the sentiment turned, the media illustrated a selective engagement, leading to accusations of avoiding unfavorable coverage that could have painted a more nuanced picture of the Haitian community's views on both Trump and the Clintons.",-2.0,-11.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,267.0,-1.2222222222222223,-0.04119850187265917
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In recent months, a notable shift in public opinion regarding Muslim immigration has emerged in Australia, coinciding with a provocative call from former President Donald Trump to prohibit such immigration in the United States. While Trump's appeal to ban Muslim immigration was swiftly condemned by Democrats and liberal factions as overtly racist, an important distinction is found within this debate: racism typically refers to beliefs regarding superiority based on skin color, while Islam is a religion, not a race.

Nevertheless, the specter of radicalization linked to Islam and concerns surrounding terrorism have contributed significantly to discourse regarding immigration policies. These sentiments reflect a broader apprehension within parts of the Australian populace about the implications of Muslim immigration on national security and societal cohesion.

A recent poll has underscored this trend, revealing that support for a ban on Muslim immigration has surged to 49% among Australians, a substantial increase from 28% recorded just last October. The findings indicate that public sentiment, previously simmering below the surface, is now openly engaging with the contentious topic. Moreover, the poll shows that 48% of voters are in favor of initiating a national debate on the subject, with a diverse array of political affiliations backing the notion. This suggests that the push for a ban is not isolated to fringe groups, but rather is resonating within the broader context of Australian society.

The primary motivations driving this growing support are fears related to terrorism and the belief that Muslims, as migrants, struggle to integrate effectively into Australian culture. These concerns reflect not just individual apprehensions but also a perceived collective sentiment regarding the future sociocultural landscape of the nation.

The pollster's insights indicate that this noteworthy backing of a Muslim immigration ban is not just a transient trend but illustrates a significant societal undercurrent that speaks to heightened fears and anxieties. With nearly half of the population advocating for restrictions, it raises critical questions about how Australia chooses to navigate immigration policy in an increasingly globalized and interconnected world.

In contrast to these shifting sentiments, political figures like Hillary Clinton have drawn criticism for their responses to opponents of such immigration policies. Clinton's use of derogatory labels, such as “deplorables,” highlights a perceived failure among some leaders to engage constructively with dissenting views. Critics argue that paltry attempts to acknowledge opposing sentiments may deepen the divisions within society rather than bridge them.

The conversation surrounding immigration, particularly concerning Muslim individuals, serves as a reflection of larger societal tensions that need addressing. Acknowledging the intertwined concerns over national security and communal integration is critical in fostering a respectful dialogue. The growing call for a national debate signifies a moment of reckoning where diverse perspectives can be examined and understood, rather than simply dismissed.

As discussions unfold, the critical question remains: how should Australia reconcile the fears and apprehensions of its citizens with the principles of inclusivity and tolerance that are foundational to its identity? The answer could shape not only the future of Australian immigration policy but also the nation’s dialogue surrounding multiculturalism in an era increasingly defined by global challenges and local responses.

In conclusion, the current trajectory regarding public opinion on Muslim immigration in Australia offers a glimpse into the complexities of balancing national security concerns with the ideals of a multicultural society. As this dialogue evolves, it will be essential for all parties to engage thoughtfully and constructively to navigate the nuanced terrain of immigration and integration in contemporary Australia.",2.0,0.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,649.0,0.0,0.0

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a disturbing incident that unfolded in the heart of the city, a street fight escalated dramatically when an unknown individual set the combatants ablaze, triggering chaos and outrage among onlookers. The shocking nature of this event has drawn comparisons to other infamous cases of extreme violence and has ignited a broader conversation about the societal shifts in how conflicts are approached and witnessed.

According to reports, a group of individuals became embroiled in a heated confrontation in the streets, an occurrence that has regrettably become more commonplace in urban settings. However, what transpired next was far from ordinary. In an act that many are finding difficult to comprehend, a person involved in the fight suddenly set the fighters on fire, resulting in pandemonium as bystanders scrambled in fear and shock. The motives behind this gruesome escalation remain unclear, further amplifying the public’s dismay at such a violent turn of events.

The ramifications of this action have raised significant concerns regarding the mentality of individuals who resort to such extreme forms of violence. The act not only endangered the lives of the fighters but also put at risk the safety of many innocent people nearby. Questions linger: What kind of mindset leads to such a brutal response in the face of conflict, and what does it say about our society’s growing desensitization to violence?

Additionally, the incident calls attention to another alarming trend—people recording dangerous situations on their phones instead of intervening. In the digital age, the impulse to capture shocking events for social media often overshadows the instinct to help those in peril. This incident starkly contrasts past societal norms, where the community would more often have stepped in to mediate conflicts with a measure of humanity and compassion. The evolution of this behavior highlights the potential decline of empathy in tumultuous situations.

Buzzfeed has recently claimed that a description of the incident involving the crime and its victims was inaccurately portrayed in an article. However, the original source of the information has firmly refuted these assertions, ensuring that the narrative surrounding the event is clarified. As discussions continue regarding this unsettling incident, the community remains in shock, grappling with the implications of such violence on public safety and social norms.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The necessity of a border wall is emphasized for preventing illegal immigration and securing access to America.

Luna County, New Mexico, is currently under the spotlight after a routine traffic stop involving an undocumented woman originally from the Middle East raised alarms regarding national security. The woman’s suspicious behavior and her plans concerning a nearby gas pipeline have intensified discussions on the pressing necessity of a border wall to prevent illegal immigration and secure access to America.

Law enforcement officials became alerted when they stopped the undocumented woman. Her plans for the gas pipeline drew immediate attention and prompted an investigation by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force in collaboration with U.S. Border Patrol. Although their investigation found no immediate threats related to her actions, the nature of the plans and her undocumented status has raised concerns about potential terrorist activities targeting the region.

The pipeline in question is situated in a remote area, further fueling suspicions regarding her intentions. Experts argue that the incident highlights the risk posed by individuals who may wish to exploit vulnerabilities in the border security system, suggesting that these kinds of events could be indicative of future terror attacks.

Concerns have particularly focused on the implications of an undocumented Muslim woman near the U.S.-Mexico border. A report published by Judicial Watch in 2015 cited instances of collaboration between Mexican cartels and terrorist organizations in smuggling individuals from conflict-ridden countries into the United States. This collaboration establishes a troubling precedent that underscores the potential dangers of an unsecured border.

Moreover, a 2017 report revealed that Islamic terror groups based in Mexico have illegally crossed into the U.S. for reconnaissance purposes. This history underscores the urgency with which lawmakers must act to enhance border security. Many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. do not originate from Mexico and are often believed to receive assistance from the Mexican government, further complicating the border security landscape.

As awareness of these risks expands, urgency is being expressed for Congress to allocate funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Such a measure is viewed as crucial not only in combating illegal immigration but also in providing a vital shield against the complexities posed by drug cartels and other foreign threats.

With growing concerns about how easily a terrorist could cross the southern border from countries with inadequate travel vetting procedures, the call for immediate action to construct a border wall has become an imperative for national security. The incident in Luna County serves as a poignant reminder of the potential risks that remain without a fortified border.",-44.0,-45.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,453.0,-2.6470588235294117,-0.09933774834437085
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In an era where success often comes at the cost of personal values, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands as a beacon of unwavering faith and commitment to serving others. Wilson has made it clear that his beliefs are not just a matter of rhetoric; they form the very foundation of his life and career.

Wilson has expressed a strong desire to help others find joy and peace through positive choices, inspiring hope, and fostering faith in God. This commitment has not been merely verbal; instead, Wilson has chosen to demonstrate his beliefs through actions, particularly after receiving guidance from the NFL not to speak openly about his faith. In an environment where such discussions are sometimes discouraged, Wilson's dedication to his principles is all the more striking.

At the core of Wilson's priorities lies a steadfast belief in placing his relationship with God first, followed by family and friends, and placing football third. This hierarchy, according to Wilson, is instrumental in maintaining his strength and composure amidst the pressures of professional sports. “When you have your life in order, everything else falls into place,” he remarked, explaining that keeping these priorities leads to positive outcomes and significantly reduces stress.

In contrast to Wilson's principled stance, many leaders in various fields may lose sight of their values once they attain fame and success. This inconsistency raises serious concerns regarding a pervasive culture of corruption in leadership roles, where the voices of prominent figures are often misused for self-aggrandizement rather than uplifting others. Wilson’s dedication to service creates a stark contrast against this prevailing narrative, positioning him as an athlete who embodies integrity.

Furthermore, Wilson's commitment also shines a light on a broader societal issue regarding the perception of discussing faith publicly. Many individuals view expressions of faith as controversial or inappropriate, while other forms of disrespect seem to be tolerated more readily. This troubling double standard prompts reflection on why helping others and spreading happiness have become stigmatized in contemporary discussions.

It raises poignant questions about the societal values we hold; when did the act of promoting joy and faith shift from being celebrated to something to be avoided? Wilson's efforts to live out his faith and serve as a role model challenge this narrative, advocating for a culture that values kindness, compassion, and selflessness.

As Wilson strives to stand firm in his beliefs, he underscores the urgency of standing up for truth and righteousness, particularly in a society grappling with various challenges. His actions resonate deeply with fans, peers, and aspiring athletes alike, encouraging them to reflect on their priorities and the impacts of their choices.

In the face of adversity and pressure, Wilson's approach to faith and service serves not only as an inspiration for personal conduct but as a rallying cry for others to embrace their values wholeheartedly. By promoting a sense of duty to help others while fostering hope and joy, Wilson redefines what it means to be a leader in the world of sports and beyond.

In a time when the integrity of leaders is often called into question, Russell Wilson’s dedication serves as a reminder of the profound impact an unwavering commitment to faith and service can have, not just on an individual's life but on the community at large. Through his example, Wilson invites others to prioritize their values, pursue joy, and contribute positively to the world around them.",79.0,85.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,653.0,3.8636363636363638,0.13016845329249618
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

Pope Francis has taken a firm stance against what he describes as fear-based media, likening its impact to that of terrorism during a recent address to the Italian press. The Pope articulated his concerns over how journalism rooted in gossip and rumors can be destructive, emphasizing that such reporting not only tarnishes reputations but also has the potential to inflict considerable harm on individuals and society at large.

In a world where media narratives significantly shape public perception, the Pope underscored the immense power wielded by journalists. He referred to their voices as a “significant weapon” that can perpetuate fear among the populace. His remarks come at a time when the Italian press is grappling with issues related to nationalism and its representation within media outlets. 

As the Pope highlighted the dangers of fear-mongering in journalism, a connection can be drawn to the tactics employed by certain media outlets, particularly Fox News, which has gained notoriety for its dramatic portrayal of issues surrounding crime and terrorism. This influence is particularly pronounced in the context of American politics and has been notably linked to the rhetoric surrounding former President Donald Trump.

Despite a marked decrease in crime rates and minimal risks of terrorism in the United States, public anxiety appears to be on the rise. Recent polls indicate a troubling trend: a significant spike in Americans expressing fears about becoming victims of terrorism and crime. This phenomenon raises questions about the role of media narratives in shaping public sentiment, particularly the contributions of fear-driven messaging.

Fox News's approach to reporting often capitalizes on sensationalism, potentially exacerbating fears that are not proportionate to reality. The Pope’s critique resonates in this landscape; he advocates for journalism that uplifts and informs rather than incites panic and division. By labeling fear-based reporting as akin to terrorism, Pope Francis calls for greater accountability in media practices and urges journalists to consider the societal impact of their stories.

As concerns about fake news and sensationalized narratives continue to grow, the Pope’s insights serve as a reminder of the ethical responsibilities held by the media. His call for integrity and compassion in journalism is crucial for fostering a more informed and less fearful public discourse. 

In a time when fear threatens to overshadow reasoned dialogue, Pope Francis's message is more relevant than ever. As society grapples with the ramifications of sensationalist reporting, his challenge to the media to prioritize truth and empathy over fear could pave the way for a more responsible and constructive future in journalism.",-56.0,-42.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,473.0,-2.4705882352941178,-0.08879492600422834
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

In the wake of the first general election debate, contrasting polling results have stirred debate among analysts and voters alike, with CNN declaring Hillary Clinton the winner according to their internal polling, which suggested Clinton garnered 62% of the vote against Donald Trump’s 27%. This result, however, has raised eyebrows due to the allegedly Democratic-leaning sample that CNN employed for their survey, leading many to question its validity.

In stark contrast to CNN’s findings, snap polls from TIME Magazine and CBS New York crowned Trump as the victor of the debate. These competing assessments reflect the polarizing nature of both candidates and highlight the contentious environment leading up to the pivotal election, which is now just a month away.

The debate covered several significant topics, including the contentious Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and Trump's tax returns. Each of these issues is likely to be dissected by voters as they make their decisions in the coming weeks. Trump, buoyed by reports favoring him in various polls, took to Twitter to express his gratitude for the support, while Clinton has yet to publicly respond to the mixed polling implications.

Despite the overall narrative suggesting a Clinton victory, mixed polling results indicate that voter support for her may not be assured. Analysts suggest that even with a perceived debate win, uncertainty looms over whether undecided voters will ultimately favor Clinton when they cast their ballots.

Adding another layer of intrigue, Trump claimed to have struggled with a defective microphone during the debate, an issue he believes hindered his performance. He also hinted that he ought to have addressed Bill Clinton’s past infidelities during the discussion, suggesting that he could have capitalized on opportunities to bolster his position.

As speculation grows, Julian Assange has hinted at an ""October surprise"" looming over Clinton's campaign, potentially introducing unforeseen developments that could influence the final stretch of the election. With limited time remaining for candidates to sway voter opinions, the next few weeks will be critical in determining the outcome of this highly charged election.",18.0,10.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,401.0,0.7692307692307693,0.02493765586034913
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

According to CNN's focus group, which was convened in Florida, the overwhelming sentiment indicated support for Clinton with an 18-2 favor. Meanwhile, a separate group organized by Frank Luntz for Fox News, based in Pennsylvania, also showed a favorable bias towards Clinton, though with a slightly narrower margin, reporting a preference of 16-6.

During the debate, Trump's performance appeared inconsistent. He struggled significantly when it came to discussing tax policies, yet managed to regain some ground when addressing Clinton's controversies relating to her emails. However, he faltered when he revisited questions surrounding President Obama's birthplace, which detracted from his overall performance.

In a striking contrast, another poll portrayed a dramatically different narrative, claiming that Trump emerged victorious with a staggering 92% support compared to Clinton's 8%. This conflicting feedback on the debate's outcome sparked discussions among political commentators and viewers alike.

Following the debate, Clinton took to social media to declare her victory, leading to a notable backlash. Many users rallied around the hashtag #TrumpWon, which began to trend rapidly, revealing the polarized reception of her post-debate statements. Critics have also highlighted her decision to refrain from engaging with media outlets immediately after the debate, suggesting this could be a strategic misstep in the face of ongoing scrutiny.

Additionally, comments directed at Clinton’s previous email controversies added fuel to the fire, as her debate performance and subsequent social media activity continued to be analyzed for effectiveness. As the race for the presidency heats up, these reactions will likely play a critical role in shaping public perception heading into the next stages of the campaign.",18.0,7.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,340.0,0.5384615384615384,0.020588235294117647
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

**Charlotte, NC —** Protests in Charlotte erupted for a second consecutive night following the tragic police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, drawing attention to ongoing issues of police violence and its impact on African-American communities. The protests commenced peacefully, characterized by demonstrators holding signs emblazoned with the message, “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot.” However, the atmosphere shifted dramatically with the arrival of riot police, ultimately resulting in violent clashes and critical injuries.

The rallying cry for justice took a somber turn when a civilian was critically injured after being shot in the head amid the chaos that ensued. In the aftermath, police immediately claimed that the shooter was another civilian, an assertion that has faced scrutiny from numerous eyewitness accounts. Many present during the incident have voiced skepticism, suggesting that it may have been law enforcement that fired the shots.

Among those providing a firsthand account was Todd Zimmer, an emergency responder who took to social media to explode the official narrative. On Twitter, he criticized city officials for what he deemed a falsification of events, asserting that their claims were misleading and that the truth regarding the shooting needed to be recognized.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and a prominent eyewitness, corroborated Zimmer's suspicions. Meyer explained that he witnessed the shocking incident unfold and firmly stated that the shooting did not result from a civilian's actions. His testimony echoed those of others who were present as tensions flared, further emphasizing a disconnect between reported actions and the experiences shared by people in the vicinity of the shooting.

As the protests gathered momentum and more demonstrators filled the streets with calls for justice and reform, the climate remained charged. Initially, the scene represented hope for change, basked in the poignant simplicity of peaceful assembly. However, the introduction of riot police altered the fabric of the demonstration, taking what was once an optimistic gathering and transforming it into a battlefield of conflicting interests and narratives.

Meyer noted that the reaction from police was an “unnecessary escalation,” fundamentally altering the atmosphere of the protests. Eyewitness testimony became critical in painting a clearer picture of the chaos in the moments leading up to the shooting. Reports indicated that the sound of the gunshot was described as louder and more intense than what would typically be expected from a standard firearm, heightening concerns that police involvement was far more likely than the official claim of civilian conflict.

As the city circulated a tweet insisting that the shooting was related to civilian action, this narrative faced increasing pushback from those who had witnessed the events first-hand. The Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice released a statement supporting the eyewitness claims, emphasizing their conviction that the protester was, in fact, shot by police. The coalition's stance reflects a broader sentiment within the community, illustrating mistrust in official statements when it comes to incidents of state violence.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, eyewitness Eddie Thomas provided detailed accounts of the chaotic scenes that unfolded. He described the severity of the injury suffered by the protester, noting a palpable absence of police assistance at a moment that demanded decisive action to help the wounded individual. Such moments only added to the frustration and distrust felt by the crowd, many of whom had gathered to advocate for justice and to raise their voices against systemic issues within the policing framework.

The tragic incident serves as a critical reminder of the ongoing tensions regarding state violence against African-American communities, a theme that has been pervasive in the national discourse surrounding protests for racial justice. Charlotte's protests represent a microcosm of a larger movement, as citizens across the country seek accountability from law enforcement and demand a reform of policing practices perceived to be rooted in systemic inequities.

As events unfold in Charlotte, the narrative surrounding Kenneth L. Scott’s death, and now the critical injury of an unnamed protester, remains fraught with contention. The city and its representatives are caught in the crossfire of burgeoning anger, with increasing calls for transparency and genuine accountability. Eyewitness accounts and public resentment present a narrative at odds with the city’s portrayal of the tragic events, raising pressing questions about the nature of policing in contexts of civil protest.

Despite efforts made by city officials to clarify their stance, the chorus of dissent continues to grow. With conflicting versions of events, the need for independent investigations into both the shooting of Kenneth L. Scott and subsequent events becomes paramount. Community leaders, activists, and citizens alike call for transparency, emphasizing that every voice matters in delineating the complexities of these recent incidents.

The community's resolve appears stronger than ever in the face of adversity. While the protests showcase the stark divide between official narratives and the lived experiences of citizens, they are also a testament to the communities' push for justice. Activists and organizers are likely to continue mobilizing efforts within Charlotte, creating a space for dialogue and reflection on the implications of police violence.

In the coming days, as the community grapples with the fallout from the shooting and the ensuing protests, it will be crucial for both local and state authorities to foster an environment conducive to honest discussion and reform. The tragic events surrounding the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott must not be in vain. Only through transparency and accountability can trust be rebuilt with the communities they serve.

As residents prepare for what lies ahead, one thing is clear: the demand for justice will not dissipate. In the shadows of the chaos, a new movement is rising—an insistence that the voices of the disenfranchised are heard and respected, that their lives matter and that the fight for justice continues, demanding true systemic change.",-74.0,-64.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,1079.0,-1.6842105263157894,-0.05931417979610751
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the Republican nominee for the upcoming election, Donald Trump finds himself under increasing scrutiny regarding his foreign policy stance, which critics argue bears an unsettling resemblance to the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A growing body of evidence points to Trump's connections with individuals closely associated with the Kremlin, raising serious questions about the implications these associations may have on U.S. foreign policy.

Reports indicate that Trump not only has maintained longstanding ties to Russia but has also benefitted from backing by Russian state media and intelligence outfits. This support, compounded with his history of business dealings within the region, paints a complex picture of Trump's interactions with Russian entities, leading many to question where his loyalties lie. Despite his numerous claims of severing business ties with Russia, a comprehensive investigation conducted by ABC News has uncovered a plethora of connections tying Trump to Russian interests, estimated to be valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

One particularly notable figure in this narrative is Sergei Millian, head of a U.S.-Russia business group, who asserts that Russian investors have successfully engaged in a variety of ventures with Trump. Trump's extensive business dealings in Russia include high-profile events such as the 2013 Miss Universe contest hosted in Moscow and the sale of real estate to a substantial number of Russian buyers. This influx of Russian investments has led to regions in Florida, such as Sunny Isles and Hollywood Islands, earning the moniker “Little Moscow,” due to the significant number of Russian expatriates and oligarchs residing there.

These Russian oligarchs, many of whom amassed their fortunes during the country's transition to a free-market economy, utilize their wealth to fortify the Putin regime, all while exerting considerable influence over the Russian economy. Critics suggest that such oligarchs often purchase Trump properties as a means of laundering their wealth, enabling them to evade sanctions imposed by Western nations. This reality raises eyebrows, particularly in light of the tighter sanctions enforced by the U.S. State Department following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

There is a looming concern that Trump's potential presidency could threaten the integrity of these sanctions, as his administration might seek to lift them in favor of smoother diplomatic relations with Russia. Such a move would not only benefit Trump’s financial ties but also further muddy the waters regarding U.S. foreign policy. The complexity of Trump's personal finances intertwined with his foreign policy ambitions creates an alarming conflict of interest that could significantly impact U.S. interactions with one of the most influential foreign players in the modern geopolitical landscape.

Amid this tumultuous backdrop, critics emphasize the urgent need to prevent Trump and his alleged connections with Russian oligarchs from reaching the presidency. The implications of these affiliations extend far beyond individual business dealings; they touch on vital national security concerns and America’s positioning on the global stage. The potential for Trump to pursue a foreign policy that contradicts U.S. interests in favor of personal gain ties directly back to the legitimacy of his claims to represent the American people.

As election day approaches, the intersection of Trump's business past with his political aspirations intensifies the stakes involved. Investigations and public discourse surrounding his connections to Russia will likely remain at the forefront of national political conversations. The evolving narrative, marked by revelations of his dealings and the implications of a Trump presidency, continues to captivate both supporters and critics alike.

Ultimately, ensuring transparency in Trump's ties to Russian interests is essential for safeguarding the integrity of U.S. foreign policy. As more facts emerge, it will be crucial for voters to consider how these connections could influence not only Trump's decisions but also the direction of American foreign affairs in the years to come. The weight of this responsibility lies heavily on the shoulders of the electorate as they prepare to make one of the most consequential decisions in recent history. The public's understanding of Trump’s relationships with Russian oligarchs and the associated risks they pose may very well shape the future landscape of American politics.",27.0,28.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,757.0,1.1666666666666667,0.036988110964332896
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is potentially confronting impeachment proceedings over his involvement in the notorious George Washington Bridge scandal, commonly known as ""Bridgegate."" This development comes as top state legislators deliberate the possibility of filing articles of impeachment if Christie is found guilty of orchestrating the controversial bridge closures aimed at achieving political retribution.

The scandal originated from the September 2013 closure of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, an act that resulted in severe traffic congestion in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and even led to one tragic death due to delayed emergency services. Federal prosecutors have implicated Christie in malicious activities associated with the bridge closure during a recent trial involving three of his senior aides. Evidence presented during the trial indicates that Christie was significantly involved in the plot, leading to heightened scrutiny of his actions and responses surrounding the incident.

In a key development, a judge has mandated that Christie produce personal emails which are related to the scandal. The availability of these emails may play a crucial role in the ongoing discussions about potential impeachment, as they could shed further light on Christie’s knowledge and response to the bridge closures. The decision to move forward rests largely on the discretion of Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto, who has the authority to initiate the impeachment process in the New Jersey Assembly.

A majority vote in the 80-member Assembly is required to approve impeachment proceedings against the governor. Should the Assembly yield a favorable vote for impeachment, the matter would advance to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be necessary for a conviction. The political implications of these potential proceedings and their timing could significantly alter the landscape of New Jersey politics, especially given Christie's current role as chairperson of Donald Trump's presidential transition team.

Christie's political reputation has seen a significant downturn since endorsing Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, a decision that followed a long period of speculation regarding his own presidential ambitions. His endorsement, while initially seen as an advantageous move, has since become a point of contention, especially in light of the ongoing Bridgegate fallout.

Revelations have surfaced indicating that Christie was informed about the bridge closures during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013. However, the governor’s failure to act upon this critical information has raised further eyebrows regarding his judgment and integrity. Moreover, Christie has repeatedly denied possessing prior knowledge of the scandal, a stance that embellishes the calls for accountability against him, particularly in light of allegations surrounding the political bullying tactics employed by his administration.

As the potential for impeachment looms, there is growing anticipation regarding Donald Trump's response to these developments. The relationship between Trump and Christie has been closely examined, especially following the governor's loyalty to the president. Any impeachment charges could test the resilience of Christie's standing with Trump, as well as with their respective supporters.

With each passing day, the situation unfolds, indicating that the implications of the Bridgegate scandal may significantly affect both Chris Christie’s political future and the broader New Jersey political landscape. The pathway ahead remains unclear, but the pending decisions from the Assembly and subsequent actions may very well determine Christie's fate as governor amid this scandal engulfing his administration.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a revealing moment from a September 2015 debate, Donald Trump asserted that he never lobbied Jeb Bush for casino gambling, suggesting that had he desired it, he would have been successful. This bold statement, however, raises significant questions regarding the former president's honesty, particularly as it contrasts sharply with his earlier testimony in a civil court deposition. There, Trump acknowledged his lobbying efforts for casino gambling in Florida, presenting a contradiction that could hint at potential perjury.

The implications of such conflicting narratives are profound. Trump’s assertion during the debate — a denial of lobbying Bush — stands in stark contrast to his own admission in court. This discrepancy could indicate either a deliberate attempt by Trump to discredit Bush or a serious breach of truth under oath. The stakes of this situation extend beyond personal reputation, drawing parallels to past political controversies, such as the impeachment of Bill Clinton, who faced severe repercussions for lying during a deposition.

The debate stage provided a platform for both Bush and Trump to articulate their stances, revealing a tangled web of differing accounts. Trump’s claims about his involvement in gambling legislation were not only contested by Bush but also opened the door to scrutinizing Trump's overall character. His apparent inability to concede any failures reflects a troubling trait, suggesting a propensity to fabricate narratives to uphold a pristine image. This behavior raises concerns about the integrity of his political persona and the broader implications for public trust in leadership.

Notably, evidence from Trump’s 2007 testimony contradicts his assertions made in the debate in 2015. During that deposition, Trump recounted efforts to persuade Bush regarding casino gambling, stating he encountered setbacks due to the resignation of an employee. This admission appears to undermine his claims of having never lobbied Bush, raising red flags about the honesty of his statements made in public discussions during the campaign.

The contrast between Trump’s actions and his debate claims indicates a deeper issue that merits careful examination. Perjury is a serious offense, especially for a sitting president. As such, this situation calls into question whether Trump has intentionally misled the public or misrepresented facts under oath. Such actions not only erode public confidence but also raise ethical and legal concerns that necessitate a response.

In considering the potential fallout from this revelation, there’s a growing chorus calling for congressional action to address what many perceive as Trump’s wrongdoing. The notion of impeachment, once reserved for the most egregious offenses, could come back into play if Trump’s past actions are deemed deserving of such a measure. As scrutiny increases, it begs the question: should failure to accurately represent history, especially in a legal context, result in disciplinary actions?

The urgency for accountability becomes even more pronounced when juxtaposed with historical precedents. Bill Clinton's impeachment for lying during a deposition underscored the gravity of such allegations and the expectation of truthfulness from leaders. In light of this, Trump’s alleged discrepancies highlight a potential double standard in the evaluation of presidential conduct.

Additionally, the ongoing narrative about Trump's character reinforces the idea that his public persona may be a carefully constructed facade. His narrative of success is pivotal to his identity and political appeal; thus, any deviation from that image may provoke reactionary defenses, often manifesting as denials or subsequent claims that contradict earlier statements. This motif of escaping failure by reshaping narratives invites further scrutiny into the nature of accountability in political contexts.

As discussions around Trump evolve, it is equally essential to consider the implications of his actions on the political landscape. When leaders bend truth, the integrity of not only their administration but the trust in democratic processes is fundamentally challenged. Lawmakers and citizens alike must grapple with the ramifications of deception, whether intentional or born from a need to protect a signature persona.

Ultimately, this situation encapsulates the challenging interplay between personal accountability, legal standards, and public perception. As the nation reflects on the potential of perjury and the integrity of its leaders, the presence of contrasting narratives underscored by Donald Trump’s actions necessitates a reevaluation of how civic accountability is enforced. The call for congressional action, including impeachment, represents a pivotal moment in assessing the obligations of those in power to uphold truth and standards of integrity in their official conduct.

In conclusion, the debate over Trump’s gambling lobbying illustrates broader themes about the importance of honesty in political life. The dissonance between his statements in public forums and legal settings raises significant questions about his character and motivations. Furthermore, it calls for a serious examination of the consequences of such discrepancies in the realm of governance. As the narrative unfolds, the political landscape may soon face crucial decisions that weigh the imperatives of accountability against the backdrop of public trust in leadership.",-29.0,-33.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,921.0,-0.8918918918918919,-0.035830618892508145
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers engaged in a drinking game during a recent CNN debate, turning it into a commercial-free event.
- The US Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, cautioned that drinking every time Donald Trump lies could lead to alcohol poisoning.
- Murthy previously warned about the risks of drinking games during GOP debates due to high instances of alcohol poisoning, particularly highlighted in 2012.
- Prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump, Murthy reiterated the dangers associated with drinking when Trump lies.
- A Politico study found that Trump told 87 lies over a five-day period, averaging a lie every three minutes and 15 seconds.
- Based on this average, it is estimated Trump may have told around 28 lies during the CNN debate with Clinton.

- The article emphasizes the importance of responsible drinking during the upcoming debates before the November 8 election, suggesting ""baby sips"" for Trump's lies.","**Surgeon General Warns About Risks of Drinking Games During CNN Debate**

In a novel twist on political engagement, many viewers participated in a drinking game during a recent CNN debate, transforming the event into a commercial-free spectacle. However, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a stark warning about the potential hazards of such games, particularly in the context of the debate's frequent occurrences of misinformation. ""Drinking every time Donald Trump lies could lead to alcohol poisoning,"" Murthy cautioned, highlighting serious risks associated with drinking games during political discussions.

This is not the first time Murthy has underscored the dangers of drinking games during GOP debates. His previous warnings, especially from 2012, addressed high incidences of alcohol poisoning as a consequence of this popular drinking activity. As the stakes rise in the lead-up to the November 8 election, Murthy reiterated these dangers, especially prior to the highly anticipated first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump.

Recent findings from a Politico study add weight to Murthy's concerns, revealing that Trump told 87 lies over just a five-day period, averaging out to a falsehood every three minutes and 15 seconds. If viewers were to apply this average to the CNN debate, estimates suggest that Trump may have told around 28 lies throughout the event, a staggering number that could have dire implications for anyone participating in a drinking game based on his statements.

In response to these statistics, the Surgeon General urged viewers to remain cautious while watching the debates. He noted that first responders were prepared for potential alcohol-related incidents during the recent debate, signifying the seriousness of the situation. 

Given the high likelihood of misinformation, Murthy urged a more responsible approach to drinking during future debates. He humorously suggested that viewers consider taking “baby sips” whenever Trump lies, as a means to mitigate the risks associated with drinking games. 

As America gears up for the upcoming presidential debates, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of responsible drinking. The combination of political discourse and drinking can lead to hazardous outcomes, and viewers are encouraged to stay safe while engaging in the electoral process. As the debate heats up, making informed choices could be just as vital as understanding the political landscape.",-17.0,-8.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,416.0,-0.5333333333333333,-0.019230769230769232
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In a political landscape charged by polarized opinions, last night’s debate results have ignited yet another firestorm of discussion surrounding the candidates’ performances. While mainstream media outlets deemed Hillary Clinton the clear winner of the debate, a contrasting narrative emerged on social media platforms, particularly on Twitter.

Following the debate, the hashtag #TrumpWon rapidly ascended to the top of Twitter trends, drawing attention to the voices of many who felt that Donald Trump had a stronger showing during the event. This divergence in sentiment illustrates the growing gulf between traditional media analysis and the instantaneous reactions of social media users, leaving room for speculation about the underlying factors at play.

The rise of the hashtag #TrumpWon has been traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. Reports link it to activities conducted by cyber-trolls associated with the Kremlin, who are known for orchestrating disinformation campaigns aimed at sowing discord among American voters. This revelation has raised persistent questions around the influence of foreign actors in domestic political conversations.

Experts on cybersecurity and disinformation have voiced concerns about these Russian troll operations, which are designed to exacerbate rivalries and deepen political divisions within the United States. With Vladimir Putin reportedly favoring Trump for his stance on sanctions against Russian oligarchs and a potential leniency towards aggression in Eastern Europe, the association between online trends and Russian interests becomes all the more troubling.

Inside Russia, former blog writers turned dissidents have described their working conditions within these troll farms as harsh, likening it to an “internet sweatshop.” This stark portrayal of life as a cyber-troll raises ethical questions about the manipulation of social media in democratic processes and the impact it may have on the electoral landscape.

As the fallout from the debate continues, calls for action against Trump’s presidency are gaining momentum, with discussions of impeachment efforts becoming more pronounced. Critics argue that the disinformation tactics employed by foreign entities could further undermine the integrity of the political process, leading to a diminished trust in governance and electoral outcomes.

The collision of media narratives and social media sentiments reflects a wider discord in public opinion, as Americans grapple with the implications of foreign interference in their democracy. As the political landscape evolves, the significance of these events highlights the ongoing struggle to discern truth in an age characterized by information overload and digital manipulation.",-9.0,-10.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,446.0,-0.7142857142857143,-0.02242152466367713
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

- Palantir's spokesperson claims the company will ""vigorously"" defend against the allegations.","**Palantir Technologies Faces Federal Lawsuit Over Employment Discrimination Against Asian Applicants**

In a significant legal challenge, Palantir Technologies, a company co-founded by Peter Thiel, is now embroiled in a federal lawsuit alleging employment discrimination against Asian applicants. The U.S. Department of Labor has filed the suit, raising serious concerns about the hiring practices of the data-driven technology company.

The lawsuit posits that Palantir hired only four Asian candidates out of a pool of 130 applicants for engineering intern positions, despite the fact that a substantial 73% of applicants identified as Asian. This stark disparity raises questions about how the company manages its recruitment processes and whether it adheres to the principles of equal opportunity in its hiring decisions.

Patricia Shiu, the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), emphasized the vital importance of rigorous non-discriminatory hiring practices for federal contractors. ""It is the responsibility of companies like Palantir to ensure their hiring processes are equitable and free from bias,"" she stated. The implications of this lawsuit are broad, not just for Palantir, but for other firms operating under similar regulatory scrutiny.

In response to the allegations, a spokesperson for Palantir Technologies asserted that the organization plans to ""vigorously"" defend itself against the claims. The company's approach to this lawsuit may set a precedent for how similar claims are handled in the tech industry, where diversity and inclusion have increasingly become focal points for both public scrutiny and regulatory oversight.

Peter Thiel, a well-known figure in Silicon Valley, has always been a polarizing personality. As a first-generation immigrant, Thiel’s own background is noteworthy; however, his support of policies that oppose immigration has drawn criticism for its apparent contradiction with his personal story. This irony has been a topic of discussion in various media outlets, especially considering the broader implications for a company like Palantir, which thrives on technological innovation, often heavily reliant on diverse talent pools.

Thiel is not only recognized for his contributions as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook but has also gained notoriety for his contentious support of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Speculation abounds regarding his ambitions within the Republican Party, with reports suggesting he sought a lifetime nomination to the Supreme Court—a claim that both he and former President Trump have publicly denied.

Despite being the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention, Thiel's affiliation with a party whose platform has historically been seen as anti-LGBT raises further questions about his role in the political arena. This juxtaposition of ideologies within Thiel's career highlights the complex relationship between personal identity and political affiliation, especially amid significant cultural shifts surrounding LGBTQ+ rights in America.

As the lawsuit unfolds, it presents an opportunity for Palantir to address systemic issues within its hiring process. The tech industry has faced mounting pressure to improve representation and foster an inclusive workplace. As a prominent federal contractor, Palantir's policies and practices will be under scrutiny not only from the Department of Labor but also from advocates championing diversity in employment.

The federal lawsuit serves as a reminder of the crucial balance that companies must maintain between achieving their operational goals and upholding ethical hiring practices. The outcome of this case could influence corporate governance in the tech sector and beyond, specifically regarding how organizations attract and retain a diverse workforce.

As discussions around diversity, equity, and inclusion continue to gain momentum, Palantir Technologies finds itself at a crossroads. The company’s response to the allegations will undoubtedly shape its reputation and could potentially influence broader industry practices in the future.

With the spotlight now on Palantir and its hiring practices, stakeholders—including employees, applicants, and the public—will be watching closely to see how this pivotal case develops. The outcomes could reinforce standards for hiring beyond the immediate context of Palantir, reverberating throughout the technology industry and impacting how diversity initiatives are approached across the board.",-18.0,12.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,729.0,0.48,0.01646090534979424

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

In the aftermath of the Chelsea bombing that occurred on Saturday evening in New York City, new details are emerging that shed light on the chilling and complex nature of the incident. Authorities uncovered a handwritten letter with Arabic text inside a bag that contained a second bomb, deepening concerns about the motives and identity of the perpetrator.

The Chelsea bombing, which took place just days ago, injured 29 individuals. Fortunately, all victims have since received treatment and been discharged from hospitals. However, the threat of further violence looms large as an anonymous 911 caller warned that “There will be more,” igniting fears of additional attacks in the area and raising alarms across local law enforcement agencies.

In a disturbing turn, a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ has come to light, claiming to be the manifesto of the individual responsible for the explosions. The page articulates the author's disdain for societal norms, particularly views surrounding the LGBTQ+ community and various forms of inequality. It suggests that the actions taken during the bombing were not mere acts of violence but rather tests for potential future attacks. 

Investigators soon found another pressure-cooker bomb concealed in a Dumpster located only four blocks from the site of the Chelsea explosion, raising the stakes and urgency of the investigation. Authorities are working tirelessly to trace the connections between the bombs and the individual behind the troubling online manifesto.

The Tumblr post reveals not only a resentment toward societal standards but also a tangible determination to instigate change through violent means. The author expresses a clear commitment to eliminate perceived targets, indicating that their actions are driven by a dangerous ideology. This development highlights a more profound issue related to radicalization and the ways individuals can be influenced by extremist beliefs proliferating online.

As the investigation unfolds, law enforcement officials are focusing on the implications of the handwritten letter found with the second bomb. The Arabic text may provide crucial insights into the motivations behind the attacks and potentially lead to identifying the person responsible. Given the nature of the written material and the context of the bombing, officials stress the importance of a thorough examination of every piece of evidence.

New York City leaders have responded with a blend of determination and concern. Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed gratitude that no fatalities occurred and praised the resilience of those affected. However, officials are urging the public to remain vigilant as they continue to analyze all leads. The idea that there could be further plots in the works has heightened tensions, with residents on high alert.

As community members attempt to resume their daily lives amidst ongoing fears of more violence, the chilling messages from the Tumblr manifesto have sparked conversations about the broader societal issues that could drive such radical views. The complex socio-political factors contributing to this mindset are being examined as part of the ongoing investigation.

Current measures in place include increased security in crowded areas and ongoing research into the ideological roots of such violent expressions. As authorities work to dismantle the potential for further attacks, the priority remains clear: safeguard the community and bring those responsible to justice.

With unanswered questions lingering in the wake of the Chelsea bombing, New Yorkers remain united in their resolve to stand strong against threats to their safety and well-being.",-25.0,-25.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,622.0,-1.0,-0.04019292604501608
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As Donald Trump continues his active campaign for re-election, concerns are growing about his fitness and mental state. At 70 years old, the former president has been hitting the campaign trail hard for months. However, signs of fatigue are beginning to show. Trump's schedule has been packed with rallies, some held at the last minute, which he has claimed are for ""relaxation."" This approach raises questions about whether he is overextending himself, particularly in the lead-up to crucial events.

In what many observers have noted as an alarming incident, Trump took to Twitter on the eve of a significant debate against Hillary Clinton and posted a message that many found incoherent. The tweet bizarrely combined three unrelated topics—violence involving a Middle Eastern immigrant, rising drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots occurring in North Carolina. This mixture not only sparked confusion among followers but also drew criticism about his ability to articulate clear, consistent messages during a critical phase of his campaign.

The abrupt shift in topics within the tweet suggests that Trump may be struggling to maintain focus and coherence, which could have implications for his performance in the impending debate. As expectations mount for this pivotal confrontation with Clinton, there are rising concerns that he might be unprepared and potentially unfit to engage effectively under the scrutiny of voters and media alike.

Amid a contentious political landscape, such missteps may indicate a turning point in Trump's campaign. As he faces the challenges ahead, the scrutiny of his mental acuity and physical stamina is intensifying. With the pressure of the debate looming, the ability to convey clear, focused arguments could play a critical role in shaping voter perceptions.

The upcoming debate represents more than just a political showdown; it is also a test of Trump's resilience and capacity to address diverse issues in a coherent manner. Whether he can rise to the occasion and project the commanding presence necessary for a successful campaign will be closely watched as the stakes continue to escalate in the run-up to Election Day.",-22.0,2.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,392.0,0.13333333333333333,0.00510204081632653

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone?

Delaware, Ohio – Hillary Clinton faced an unexpected setback this week during a door-knocking event aimed at reinvigorating her campaign ahead of the upcoming election. The gathering, which had hoped to rally support and generate enthusiasm among local voters, was characterized by its dismal turnout. In a surprising twist, only one individual showed up to the event—a supporter of her rival, Donald Trump.

Members of Clinton's campaign staff had anticipated the presence of a bustling group of volunteers who would help engage the community. Instead, the absence of supporters left only her staff members to represent the campaign. The solitary Trump supporter, identified shortly after arriving, was asked to leave the premises by Clinton's team, further illuminating the challenges her campaign is currently facing.

The event's lack of attendance raises serious questions about Clinton's ground game and the level of enthusiasm surrounding her candidacy. With an empty campaign office serving as a backdrop, observers suggest this incident may reflect broader issues that could spell trouble for Clinton as the election draws nearer. If such trends continue to manifest on a national scale, she may find herself in a precarious position against a well-supported Trump campaign.

The stark contrast between Clinton's event and Trump's rallies is hard to ignore. While Clinton struggles to attract a few interested participants, Trump’s events are routinely marked by large crowds and fervent supporters. This disparity in engagement underscores a troubling narrative for the Clinton campaign, suggesting a gap in enthusiasm among potential voters.

Moreover, there are growing concerns regarding Clinton's overall campaign funding and the support she is receiving from her base. The lack of volunteers at the Delaware door-knocking event could indicate a larger trend of disengagement that may complicate her path to success in the election. With Trump drawing sizable audiences and generating significant media coverage, Clinton’s struggle to rally her supporters could pose substantial challenges ahead.

Analysts are beginning to speculate how these dynamics might play out in the upcoming election cycle. If Clinton fails to galvanize her supporters and attract new volunteers, she may find it increasingly difficult to compete against Trump's aggressive campaign strategy. The empty chairs and vacant space at the Delaware event serve as a stark reminder of the uphill battle that lies ahead for her campaign as it seeks to counter Trump's momentum.

As Clinton’s campaign navigates this period of uncertainty, it will be crucial for her to address the concerns raised by this underwhelming event. Strategizing new methods to inspire volunteers and build a strong network of local supporters will be critical in the weeks to come. 

The larger implications of this event cannot be overstated. As Clinton aims to craft a narrative of hope and progress, she will need to ensure that her campaign is resonating with the electorate. The enthusiasm gap highlighted in Delaware is a call to action for her team, signaling the need for a renewed focus on engaging voters and rebuilding trust among her supporters.

As the election draws nearer, the outcome remains uncertain. Still, one thing is clear: the lack of participation in Clinton’s door-knocking event serves as a warning sign. If she does not address these issues swiftly and effectively, she may find herself at a significant disadvantage in the battle against Donald Trump. The time for revitalization is now, as the clock ticks down to the election.",-7.0,8.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,647.0,0.2857142857142857,0.012364760432766615

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

A recent bombing in New York City has raised serious national concerns about the potential for further attacks, prompting an immediate response from political figures and media outlets alike. Former President Donald Trump was among the first to comment on the incident, categorically labeling it a ""bombing."" However, his choice of terminology sparked a backlash from CNN, which criticized Trump for his wording while neglecting to mention that former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had also referred to the attack using the same term.

The situation escalated when CNN edited footage of Clinton’s remarks, which had included her calling the incident a bombing. This editorial decision did not go unnoticed, as it was highlighted by supporters of Trump and others who accused the network of bias.

In response to Trump's comments, CNN anchor Jake Tapper took to the airwaves to express discontent over the former president’s statements, suggesting he had hastily jumped to conclusions without adequate information. This criticism was notably consistent across two separate broadcasts but did not address Clinton’s similar use of the term “bombing,” raising questions about the impartiality of the reporting.

During a subsequent interview on the Fox News program ""Fox and Friends,"" Trump did not shy away from responding to CNN’s critique. He condemned the network, calling it “disgusting and disgraceful” and accused its reporting of being fundamentally dishonest. Trump defended his characterization of the NYC incident, arguing that his description was entirely accurate and attacking CNN by branding it the ""Clinton news network."" His remarks underscored a continuing theme in Trump’s rhetoric that suggests a perceived collusion between media outlets and the political elite.

In separate remarks, Trump turned his attention to a broader issue—terrorism and national security. He criticized current leaders whom he deemed ""stupid"" for being too lenient on terrorism, asserting that this leniency could lead to an increase in threats facing the nation. His comments reflect a long-standing narrative among certain political circles that emphasizes a tough stance on national security as a countermeasure to terrorism.

A significant part of Trump’s commentary focused on President Obama's strategy of accepting more than 110,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. He voiced strong concerns regarding the vetting process, claiming it was insufficient to ensure the safety of American citizens. Trump extended his critique to Clinton, who he argues has demonstrated a willingness to further increase the number of refugees entering the U.S. should she win the presidency, stating that such policies would compromise national security.

The fallout from the bombing incident in New York City continues to generate heated discussions and disagreements among politicians, media, and the public. As debates on how best to tackle terrorism and immigration unfold, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the nation. With national security at the forefront of electoral discourse, both Trump and Clinton have found themselves at the center of a contentious dialogue surrounding safety, policy, and the role of media in shaping public perception.

In an era marked by political polarization and media scrutiny, the bombing has opened a Pandora's box of discussions and debates that will likely persist as the nation navigates the complex landscape of security and governance. As rhetoric flares and opinions clash, one thing remains clear: the urgency for solutions to protect citizens while debating immigration and counterterrorism policy is undeniably critical in today’s climate.",-45.0,-9.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,647.0,-0.4090909090909091,-0.013910355486862442

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

In a striking legal development, Ahmad Rahami, a known terrorist and murderer, has filed a lawsuit against the police in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The lawsuit contends that police actions reflect discrimination against his family based on their cultural background, despite Rahami's own criminal history linked to bombings in the Tri-state area.

Rahami's family operates a chicken restaurant established in 2002, and in the lawsuit, they assert that local officials have made concerted efforts to shutter their business. The family claims to have faced numerous tickets and court summons deemed unfounded, which they allege is tied to their ethnic and religious identity.

The complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, highlights the family's Afghan and Muslim heritage, claiming that their cultural background has made them targets for both law enforcement scrutiny and local resident hostility. One particularly troubling allegation includes instances of racial abuse directed at them from the community, with statements such as, ""Muslims don’t belong here,"" reflecting underlying prejudices.

Further complications arose as the lawsuit alleges that Rahami's family received citations for operating their restaurant past 10 PM, despite having obtained permission to do so during a two-year period starting in April 2009. Law enforcement's justification for their actions was reportedly rooted in claims of ""too much crime"" in the vicinity of the restaurant, inferring that the establishment was a contributing factor to local criminal activity. The lawsuit accuses the police of exhibiting ""reckless disregard"" for the family’s constitutional rights, arguing they experienced harassment and retaliatory tactics intended to force the closure of their restaurant.

The allegations presented by Rahami’s family raise questions about the interplay between cultural identity, law enforcement practices, and community relations. However, the irony looms large over the legal proceedings; just five years after the filing, Rahami was apprehended for serious crimes related to bombing activities, challenging the sincerity of the family's claims of victimization.

The unsettling juxtaposition of Rahami's allegations against police conduct with his own actions as a perpetrator of violence has led to widespread public scrutiny. Observers are questioning both the motivations behind the lawsuit and the broader implications it may have for the relationship between immigrant communities and law enforcement agencies.

As the case unfolds, it may shed light on systemic issues concerning racial profiling, community safety, and the rights of individuals in minority groups. While the lawsuit seeks redress for what Rahami’s family perceives as discriminatory practices, the backdrop of Ahmad Rahami's own criminal behavior complicates the narrative, leaving many to ponder the motivations and beliefs that underpin this complex legal battle.",-49.0,-69.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,502.0,-4.6,-0.13745019920318724
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

A cloud of controversy continues to loom over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton amid allegations of pay-to-play corruption involving the Clinton Foundation. While Clinton's campaign has consistently emphasized the foundation’s charitable work in the face of scrutiny, critics argue that the organization acts more as a vehicle for financial gain for the Clintons and their associates.

A recent report from The Daily Caller has brought attention to stark financial realities within the foundation. According to the report, in 2014, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation’s budget was allocated to charitable grants. The foundation operated with a budget of just under $91.3 million that year, which translates to less than $5.2 million being directed toward charitable efforts.

In contrast, expenditures on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits amounted to $34.8 million, raising questions about the foundation's operational priorities. Furthermore, an additional $50.4 million was categorized as ""other expenses,"" which could suggest financial practices that detract from the organization's purported mission. Notably, professional fundraising expenses alone totaled nearly $851,000, indicating a significant financial focus on generating revenue rather than delivering aid.

Despite an increase of $30 million in revenue for the foundation in 2014, the amount devoted to charitable spending paradoxically dipped by 40% compared to the previous year. Expenditures for salaries and employee compensation escalated by $5 million, mirroring a similar rise in ""other expenses"" by the same sum. This trend raises valid concerns about the foundation's commitment to its charitable objectives.

The chronicling of the Clinton Foundation’s budget paints a picture where financial advantages appear to primarily benefit the Clintons. Detractors assert that Hillary Clinton allegedly leveraged her influential position as Secretary of State for monetary gain, consolidating her ties with donors while serving in office.

As the narrative around these allegations unfolds, questions abound regarding the transparency and ethical implications of the Clinton Foundation's operations. Critics argue that the foundation's financial practices warrant tighter scrutiny, insisting on accountability for its perceived misuse as a profit-generating entity.

In conclusion, while the Clinton campaign fervently defends the foundation's mission, the financial statistics paint a troubling portrait that suggests the organization primarily serves to enhance the financial welfare of the Clintons, bringing the issue of pay-to-play corruption to the forefront of political discourse.",25.0,4.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,451.0,0.25,0.008869179600886918

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a recent address delivered in New York, President [Name] ignited a wave of outrage among Americans due to his perceived arrogance and insensitivity towards the victims of recent terror attacks. The remarks came in the wake of bombings in both New York and New Jersey, as well as a brutal stabbing incident in St. Cloud, Minnesota, leaving many citizens questioning the priorities of their leader during these crises.

While the President's speech would have been an opportune moment to express solidarity with those affected by these tragic incidents, he instead chose to focus on a high-dollar fundraiser that followed his address. Critics were quick to point out that such a decision demonstrated a troubling commitment to political maneuvering over compassion for victims of terrorism.

During his remarks, the President diverted attention away from the attacks, which left a deep scar on the nation, and instead took the opportunity to lambaste media figures like Rush Limbaugh and outlets such as Fox News for what he termed ""sexism"" that has been perpetuated against Hillary Clinton. In doing so, he linked the media narrative to Clinton's campaign struggles while neglecting to acknowledge the loss and fear experienced by the victims and their families in the wake of recent violence.

Moreover, the President not only criticized former President Donald Trump but also lauded Clinton's qualities, seemingly shirking the imperative need to address the ongoing dangers posed by terrorism in the nation. This failure to mention the victims of the bombings led many to question his leadership and empathy during a time when the American public craved assurance and support from their elected officials.

Despite suggestions from some critics that the lack of detailed information regarding the attacks at the time may have hindered an immediate response, others argue that mere acknowledgment of the victims would have sufficed. The author of this critique expressed disappointment in the President's apparent lack of empathy, noting that a simple gesture of compassion could have gone a long way in healing the community’s wounds.

As the nation grapples with the unfortunate reality of terrorism, there are growing calls for elected officials to prioritize solidarity with those harmed in such acts. This sentiment has become a rallying cry for Americans who feel that their leaders must rise above political strife and come together in times of crisis. The expectation is not merely to condemn the attacks but to actively show support for the victims and emphasize the strength of the community in facing adversity.

This incident brings into stark relief the importance of maintaining a balance in presidential duties, particularly during tumultuous times. A leader’s role encompasses not only governance and policy-making but also providing emotional resilience and comfort to a frightened populace. When elected officials miss this mark, it raises profound questions about their commitment to the values they espouse.

In conclusion, the President's recent speech in New York stands as a poignant reminder of the necessity for empathy in leadership. The backlash stemming from the address signifies a vital need for elected officials to ensure their messages reflect the sentiments of their constituents. In the wake of violence, Americans expect their leaders to unite and provide solace, rather than divert attention to fundraisers and political grievances. As the nation moves forward, the hope remains that future statements will reflect the compassion and solidarity that the victims and their families so desperately need.",-25.0,-58.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,635.0,-2.761904761904762,-0.09133858267716535
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

Awareness of alleged corruption at the Clinton Foundation has surged among the American public, particularly following the release of a new report that raises serious concerns about the organization's AIDS program. The draft congressional report outlines troubling findings regarding Bill Clinton's Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), which has been a cornerstone of the foundation's philanthropic efforts.

The report reveals that CHAI reportedly distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, a practice that may have significantly increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients reliant on these essential medications. The alarming implications of this distribution have fueled growing unease and scrutiny of the Clinton charity, especially as Hillary Clinton embarks on her presidential campaign.

As one of the foundation's most significant and well-known initiatives, CHAI's reputation is now at stake. The report links Bill Clinton to controversial Indian-American figures associated with Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company notorious for its poor quality control practices. Ranbaxy has faced multiple investigations and sanctions from both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raising further questions about the efficacy and safety of the drugs distributed under CHAI.

Despite the seriousness of the allegations, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the actual number of AIDS patients who may have received the diluted medications. This ambiguity not only heightens concerns over patient health but also spurs demands for accountability and transparency in the foundation's operations.

As public awareness grows, there have been increasing calls for the Clinton Foundation to be shut down, reflecting a broader sentiment among critics who question the integrity of its programs. The ongoing fallout from this report exemplifies the challenges the foundation faces as it navigates allegations that could have far-reaching implications for its future, particularly in the charged atmosphere surrounding the current presidential campaign.",-14.0,-13.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,348.0,-1.1818181818181819,-0.03735632183908046
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?",http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,Mockarena Cotr,http://www.chicksontheright.com,{'$date': 1474332562000},,"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2fb62ae885c1cdb2a0c69249a9c25a?s=120&d=mm&r=g,http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN#!,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cotrolog-smalll.png,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CotR_banner1-copy-2.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8W3QtpyKy7xuZ.gif,http://rightchicks.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/book-thumb.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49-812x478.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kardashian-jenner-424x250.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d1x2X8_nNBHjc.gif",https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/,"{""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Chicks On The Right"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 812, ""identifier"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""height"": 550}, ""url"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""image"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""card"": ""summary"", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right""}, ""robots"": ""noodp"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/"", ""section"": ""Constitution"", ""tag"": ""felony"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-19T20:49:22-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- Arizona state legislature criticized for poorly drafted laws affecting parenting.

Arizona's state legislature is facing significant backlash following the enactment of a new law that has been criticized for its poorly drafted language, which inadvertently criminalizes common parenting activities. The law, designed to shield children from molesters, makes any contact between adults and children's genitals a criminal offense, leading to alarm among parents and legal experts alike.

The intent behind the legislation is to offer robust protection to minors, but the lack of clarity surrounding its provisions has raised substantial concerns. Routine activities such as diaper changes, baths, and other forms of care that can involve contact with a child's genitals now fall into a gray area, potentially exposing parents to serious legal consequences for performing ordinary parental duties.

The Arizona Supreme Court has weighed in on the situation, indicating that prosecutors will likely refrain from charging parents for engaging in what can be deemed innocent conduct around their children. However, the court's ruling has ignited further debate by placing the onus of proof on parents to demonstrate their innocence if accused. This shift in burden has led to fears that parents could be wrongly treated as criminals, despite acting with good intentions, thereby undermining their fundamental rights.

Legal experts have sounded the alarm over the ramifications of this law, particularly regarding the pressure it places on defendants who might opt for plea bargains. With the specter of severe charges looming, many parents could feel compelled to accept deals that would allow them to escape the potentially more damaging consequences of a trial. This issue of coercive plea bargaining has been highlighted by a law professor who noted the troubling potential for prosecutors to exploit child molestation laws in order to extract these agreements, further complicating the already challenging dynamics of parental responsibilities.

Critics of the legislation worry about the broader implications for due process rights in Arizona. The creation of a legal framework that could inadvertently label innocent parents as criminals raises urgent questions about the balance between protecting children and ensuring that parents are not unjustly penalized for normal caregiving behavior. 

Moreover, skepticism is growing regarding the government's ability to manage this sensitive issue without infringing on individual rights. Parents and caregivers across the state are expressing their unease over the potential for misinterpretation of the law, which could lead to frivolous or vindictive accusations against them, instilling a climate of fear in which innocent actions may be misconstrued.

As legislators consider the feedback and concerns surrounding this law, the conversation around the balance between child protection and parental rights continues to unfold. Stakeholders are urging state representatives to revisit the language of the law, ensuring that it effectively targets criminal behavior without sacrificing the rights of parents engaged in loving and responsible caregiving. In this complex landscape, finding a way to safeguard children while fostering an environment of trust and support for families will be paramount for the Arizona legislature moving forward.",-12.0,-32.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,540.0,-1.8823529411764706,-0.05925925925925926

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

In a surprising turn of events, reports indicate that Michelle Obama is not preparing to leave the White House, igniting discussions about her potential future in government. As speculation grows, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has allegedly conceptualized various roles for Michelle Obama, should Clinton's political ambitions come to fruition.

Michelle Obama's legacy during her time as First Lady has been met with both acclaim and criticism. Among her notable initiatives is the widely discussed school lunch program aimed at improving childhood nutrition, which has faced scrutiny and opposition from various factions. Critics argue that it has not produced the intended results, raising questions about its effectiveness and long-term impact. Additionally, her forays into social activism have sparked debates about the appropriateness of her engagement in political matters.

As conversations around her future intensify, questions about Michelle Obama's qualifications for a governmental role have begun to surface. While she has garnered popularity and admiration for her advocacy work, some argue that a formal government position requires a different skill set and experience that she may not possess.

Clinton's perspective on Michelle Obama’s potential role implies a vision where government takes on a significant responsibility in the realm of child upbringing. This approach has stirred concerns regarding the amount of influence progressive ideals may have over American education and parenting. Critics worry that such a viewpoint perceives the government as a parental authority, thereby undermining traditional family structures and local community involvement.

In the midst of these discussions, Michelle Obama remains committed to her campaign advocating for healthy living among children. Her dedication to promoting wellness and nutrition reflects her long-standing focus on issues affecting the next generation. Reports suggest that she plans to pursue this initiative indefinitely, signaling her desire to continue impacting children's lives positively.

The intertwining of Michelle Obama’s initiatives with Hillary Clinton's political strategy raises further questions about the motives behind the proposed roles for the former First Lady. Observers speculate that Clinton may be attempting to attract voters who hold favorable views towards the Obamas, recognizing their enduring popularity in certain demographics. This potential alignment hints at a broader strategy to harness the Obamas' influence to galvanize electoral support.

However, the idea of a progressive influence taking hold over aspects of parenting and education has raised alarms among some political analysts and constituents. The belief that the government could serve as a parental figure presents a contentious dilemma, raising ethical considerations regarding the limits of governmental responsibility in family life. 

As these narratives unfold, observers remain cautious, urging a critical evaluation of the implications linked to such a government role. The calls for deepening the government's involvement in child upbringing echo broader societal concerns about personal autonomy and the balance between governmental oversight and family independence.

With an array of opinions swirling around the potential pathways for Michelle Obama following her tenure in the White House, the landscape of American policy regarding children’s health and education stands at a crossroads. As discussions continue and decisions loom on the horizon, the intersection of celebrity, influence, and governance remains a point of engagement and contention in American political discourse.",6.0,18.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,595.0,0.782608695652174,0.030252100840336135

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A recent scandal has erupted surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), where allegations have surfaced regarding the distribution of ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This troubling revelation has raised grave concerns about the potential consequences for numerous African patients, with reports suggesting that the distribution of these adulterated drugs may have led to many unnecessary deaths.

The allegations center on the Indian pharmaceutical giant Ranbaxy, which is accused of providing these substandard drugs. As scrutiny mounts over the situation, questions linger regarding whether Bill and Hillary Clinton were aware of Ranbaxy's ongoing drug quality issues at the time these medications were being distributed. The timeline of the controversy is further complicated by Ranbaxy's history; the company was found guilty in 2013 of various counts related to fraud and adulterated drugs, culminating in a staggering $500 million fine from the Department of Justice. 

In an effort to delve deeper into the allegations and potential improprieties, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn has spearheaded a congressional report titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story."" This examination aims to investigate the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and Ranbaxy, raising serious concerns over the risks of morbidity and mortality associated with the substandard drugs that were being made available through the CHAI program. 

The report has highlighted the significant dangers posed to patients who relied on these medications, emphasizing the ethical implications of distributing drugs that may not have met acceptable safety standards. Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower from within Ranbaxy, has emerged as a key figure in exposing the alleged misconduct surrounding the company. His revelations have spurred further investigation, and his testimony could illuminate the complexities behind the distribution of these treatments in sub-Saharan Africa.

The congressional study also points to alarming connections between Bill Clinton and individuals who have faced investigations by both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This raises concerns about the appropriateness of these relationships and whether they impacted decision-making regarding health initiatives linked to the Clinton Foundation.

In a notable progression, the report calls into question the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, especially in light of substantial evidence indicating the company's poor quality control practices. Such practices have sparked fears that the substandard drugs distributed under the health initiative could have hastened the decline in health for countless patients battling HIV/AIDS.

Adding to the seriousness of the allegations is the revelation of a significant financial involvement between U.S. aid and Ranbaxy. In 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, which leads to critical concerns about the health implications for patients receiving these medications. The potential for accelerated mortality due to complications from HIV-related infections deepens the scrutiny surrounding the CHAI’s operations.

Despite the issues leading to Ranbaxy's drugs being banned in the United States, the company continues to distribute its products globally, with the Clinton Foundation maintaining its ties to the pharmaceutical manufacturer. This situation paints a disconcerting portrait of a pattern of corruption that raises questions about the Clintons’ commitment to genuine humanitarian efforts. Critics argue that financial interests may have taken precedence over the health and safety of vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa.

The emerging scandal underscores the need for transparency and accountability in global health initiatives, especially when they involve sensitive matters such as the treatment of life-threatening diseases. As the investigation unfolds, the implications for the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives may have lasting repercussions on the reputation of all involved. Health advocates continue to seek clarifications and stricter regulations to ensure that the integrity of humanitarian aid is maintained and that vulnerable populations receive the quality care they deserve.

In summary, the allegations facing the Clinton Health Access Initiative regarding the distribution of potentially lethal substandard HIV/AIDS medications represent a significant ethical and humanitarian crisis. With ties to a drug manufacturer previously guilty of fraud, the full extent of the consequences surrounding this debacle remains to be seen. Advocates for health equity are closely monitoring the outcomes of congressional inquiries and calling for rigorous investigations to prevent such a devastating risk to patient health from reoccurring in future humanitarian efforts. As this story continues to develop, it serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and potential pitfalls that can accompany large-scale health initiatives, especially in areas where the stakes are incredibly high.",-63.0,-40.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,818.0,-1.4814814814814814,-0.0488997555012225

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a notable decision, a federal judge has mandated the State Department to release documents connected to Hillary Clinton's security training within five days. This ruling comes amidst ongoing scrutiny regarding the handling of classified materials and secure communications by Clinton and her team during her tenure as Secretary of State.

The order stems from a lawsuit filed by The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which has actively sought these documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) complaint. The lawsuit is part of a broader effort to uncover details surrounding Clinton's compliance with security protocols that govern the handling of classified information.

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon presided over the case and demonstrated a clear sense of urgency regarding the matter. He rejected the State Department’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, indicating his support for TheDCNF’s quest for transparency. Nonetheless, he also denied the request to depose State officials, a decision that has drawn mixed reactions from those advocating for accountability.

Despite the ruling, the State Department has yet to confirm whether Clinton, along with her aides, received the mandatory security briefings on classified materials and secure communications that were expected in the course of their duties. This lack of clarity has led to heightened concerns and speculation about the state of security training undertaken by those in key positions.

The documents in question are not solely limited to Clinton. They also encompass records pertaining to her former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and advisor Jacob Sullivan. The inclusion of these individuals underscores the broader implications of the inquiry, as it touches not only on Clinton’s actions but also on the conduct of her inner circle.

Judge Leon expressed his frustration regarding the State Department's delays in producing the requested documents. In his order, he set a deadline for the release of one-third of the requested 400 documents by September 26, with the remainder to be released by October 10. This timeline reflects the court's commitment to ensuring that information is made available in a timely manner, responding to the public's right to know.

The attorney representing TheDCNF noted Judge Leon's evident exasperation at the State Department's obstruction of the FOIA process. His remarks signal a growing concern among some officials and stakeholders regarding governmental transparency and the efficacy of processes designed to uphold accountability.

Further complicating matters, State Department officials have acknowledged that their failure to produce the documents could imply that necessary security courses had not been completed by Clinton or her aides. This admission raises serious questions about the adherence to security protocols, especially given the high-stakes nature of their work. The implications surrounding the potential lack of training highlight significant concerns about the safeguarding of sensitive information during a pivotal era in U.S. diplomatic history.

The release of these documents could have broader ramifications, potentially shedding light on longstanding issues related to the management of classified data and the responsibilities of public officials. As the deadlines established by Judge Leon approach, public interest in the case and its outcomes continues to mount.

The determined pursuit of these documents by The Daily Caller News Foundation exemplifies ongoing efforts by media organizations and transparency advocates to hold governmental bodies accountable for their actions. With Judge Leon's order, clarity on the security training received by Clinton and her high-ranking aides could soon come to fruition, providing much-needed insights into the protocols of public officials entrusted with national security matters.

As the upcoming release dates draw nearer, all eyes will be on the State Department to see how it navigates Judge Leon's timeline. The delivery of this information may prove crucial not only for regulatory compliance but also for public trust in the operations of government agencies.",-5.0,6.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,705.0,0.23076923076923078,0.00851063829787234
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

In the lead-up to the highly anticipated first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, moderator Lester Holt has indicated that he will not employ on-the-spot fact-checking. This decision has sparked serious debate about the implications it may have for the integrity of the political discourse during the event.

The absence of real-time fact-checking allows Trump, who has been documented to lie on average every three-and-a-half minutes, to make unaccountable statements. The responsibility of holding the candidates accountable during the debate ultimately falls to Holt, creating pressure on him to challenge misleading assertions directly. While Clinton may push back against Trump’s claims, the lack of independent verification could skew the perception of truthfulness, enabling misleading narratives to go unchecked.

Major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, have also opted against providing on-screen fact checks during the debate, leaving viewers without instant access to verified information. The media's reluctance to engage in this form of accountability raises questions about their integrity and role in the democratic process, especially in an election where misinformation has proliferated.

Clinton’s campaign has emphasized the critical importance of directly challenging Trump’s falsehoods during the debate to ensure a fair and informed competition. However, the dynamics of the debate may place an undue burden on Clinton to convincingly prove her superiority in the face of unverified statements, with the media landscape shaping the narrative around both candidates.

Critics of the current media landscape argue that the industry prioritizes ratings over journalistic integrity, suggesting a decline in standards that once held political figures accountable. The decision to forego fact-checking mechanisms not only hinders the debate process but could also influence voter perceptions and ultimately, the election outcome.

As the debate approaches, the implications of the lack of fact-checking are becoming increasingly evident. With Trump free to make unsubstantiated claims, and Clinton challenged to uphold her credibility without the reinforcement of independent verification, the effectiveness of the debate as a tool for informed public discourse will be put to the test. The fallout from this decision resonates far beyond just the candidates involved; it reaches into the very core of democratic integrity and the role of the media in shaping public opinion. 

As viewers prepare to engage with the debate, the stakes are high, and the absence of fact-checking mechanisms looms large - raising pressing questions about truth and accountability in the political arena. With the media landscape already fraught with challenges, the upcoming debate may serve as a critical juncture for the establishment of standards that enhance, or undermine, the integrity of political dialogue in the age of misinformation.",-6.0,-3.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,492.0,-0.1875,-0.006097560975609756
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

In a bold assertion that is sure to stir controversy, Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has publicly expressed her concerns regarding Hillary Clinton’s suitability for the presidency. In an interview that has garnered significant attention, Kyle raises issues about Clinton's emotional and physical well-being, suggesting that anger and rage could jeopardize her candidacy.

Kyle's remarks come as a stark commentary on what she perceives as signs of cognitive impairment in Clinton. She claims that these cognitive deficiencies, coupled with concerns about her physical fitness, render Clinton unfit for the duties of the highest office in the land. According to Kyle, indicators of emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty completing basic tasks further exacerbate these concerns.

The former friend of Bill Clinton did not hold back when describing Clinton’s personality, noting traits such as paranoia and an overwhelming desire for control. Such aspects, Kyle argues, could be detrimental to a presidential candidate who needs to embody stability and clarity in leadership. ""These personality traits can raise red flags,"" she stated, questioning whether they would serve the nation well in a role that demands strong decision-making skills and emotional fortitude.

To articulate her viewpoint, Kyle authored a controversial book entitled ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" in which she expounds on her beliefs regarding Clinton's health and an alleged addiction to power. In her book, she outlines how Clinton's ambition has manifested since the early days of her involvement with Bill Clinton back in 1971, suggesting that a relentless pursuit of power could have negative implications for her health and judgment.

Kyle's claims arrive amidst a backdrop of ongoing challenges faced by Hillary Clinton, including scrutiny regarding her public image and lingering scandals related to her health and character. The mounting concerns voiced by Kyle may create additional hurdles for Clinton as she navigates the complex landscape of American politics.

As discussions surrounding Clinton's political future continue to unfold, Kyle’s assertions introduce a new layer of controversy that could impact the former Secretary of State’s narrative. The implications of her statements not only question Clinton's health but also challenge the foundations of her political ambitions. Whether these concerns will resonate with voters remains to be seen, but they certainly contribute to an already tumultuous political climate as the nation looks toward the future.",-13.0,-15.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,456.0,-1.0,-0.03289473684210526

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In discussions surrounding cultural identity and national unity in North America, the phrase ""nation of immigrants"" often surfaces, with the United States frequently described as a ""melting pot."" However, there is a significant emphasis on the expectation that immigrants adapt to American customs and traditions, rather than maintain their own cultural programs. This sentiment extends to neighboring Canada, where local leaders also weigh in on the required integration of immigrant communities.

A recent statement by a Quebec mayor particularly highlights the ongoing discourse regarding the Muslim community's role within Canadian society. The mayor asserted that Muslims must fully integrate into the local culture, showing respect for prevalent customs and ways of life. This perspective aligns with a broader Canadian ethos, which advocates for the welcoming of various immigrant backgrounds, albeit with an emphasis on preserving Canadian identity and culture in the process.

Critics of immigrant accommodation argue that Canadian culture should not have to change to accommodate newcomers. An example frequently cited in this debate is the celebration of Christmas and the Judeo-Christian roots of Canadian society. Some community leaders underscore that while diversity should be embraced, it should not come at the expense of the established cultural framework.

The municipality of Dorval has taken this position to heart, expressing its right to reject any concessions to Islamic practices or the implementation of Sharia law. This reflects a growing sentiment in several regions where concerns about cultural preservation are becoming more pronounced. As debates around these issues intensify, local authorities are increasingly voicing their unwillingness to alter their governing frameworks to fit the preferences of any particular group.

Those who feel uncomfortable within Canadian culture, particularly some members of the Muslim community, are reminded that many Muslim-majority countries exist for potential relocation. This assertion raises questions about the balance between cultural acceptance and the expectation of assimilation, leading to a critical evaluation of how different societies can coexist without losing their distinct identities.

In the United States, similar conversations are unfolding. Recently, Texas has taken decisive action against the incorporation of Sharia law into American courts through legislative measures. This action reinforces the belief among many that cultural integration is vital, proposing that minorities should not impose their beliefs on the majority. Advocates for this stance maintain that for a healthy societal framework, there needs to be a clear understanding that cultural integration is necessary for communal harmony.

Ultimately, the prevailing message emerging from these discussions underscores a consistent call: those who wish to enjoy the benefits of life in North America must either integrate into the existing culture or consider other options. The debate over immigration and cultural integration leaves little room for ambiguity, with a warning against efforts to change the established cultural landscape ringing loudly among proponents of these views.

As these discussions continue to evolve, it is evident that the emphasis on unity and assimilation will remain a prominent topic on both sides of the border. The ability of immigrants to embrace local customs while contributing to the richness of the national fabric is seen as vital for the continued success and stability of these northward regions. Whether through dialogue or legislative action, the conversation surrounding cultural identity in America and Canada will likely shape the future of immigration and integration policies for years to come.",12.0,20.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,613.0,0.8695652173913043,0.03262642740619902

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a tense encounter during recent riots in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through the chaotic streets. The scene unfolded as the man navigated his vehicle amid the unrest, which has been characterized by clashes and confrontations.

A photographer present at the scene initially anticipated a potentially dangerous situation, assuming that the man would be mugged given the aggressive nature of the protests. Reports from the area had indicated that some rioters had been stopping vehicles to steal from occupants or vandalize cars. However, in an unexpected turn of events, the protesters allowed the man to pass without incident.

Faced with what could have been a hostile encounter, the driver chose a controversial way to resolve the situation. He rolled down his window and displayed a handgun, a decision that swiftly prompted the protesters to disperse and clear the way for him to continue driving. This interaction raises significant questions about the dynamics of safety during protests and the measures individuals might take to protect themselves in such unpredictable scenarios.

The incident has sparked conversations on social media and among community members regarding how to appropriately handle encounters with hostile protests. Some argue that showing a weapon can escalate tensions and lead to more violence, while others emphasize the importance of self-defense in potentially life-threatening situations. Opinions are divided on the implications of the man's decision to brandish a firearm during a time of heightened emotion and unrest.

As protests continue to evolve across the nation, this incident highlights the complexities and dangers that can arise when individuals confront mass gatherings of dissent. Observers are left questioning whether this event serves as a cautionary tale about the responsibilities of those driving through protests, or if it underscores the necessity of self-protection in today's tumultuous climate. As communities seek to navigate the challenges of civil unrest, the ramifications of this encounter will likely be felt beyond North Carolina's borders.",-18.0,-32.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,372.0,-2.2857142857142856,-0.08602150537634409
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago’s environmentalists are facing scrutiny for what some critics deem a glaring hypocrisy in their stances on land use, especially following their varying approaches to two prominent projects: the proposed George Lucas Museum and the Obama Presidential Center.

In an alarming display of selective environmentalism, Chicago's Leftists have been accused of altering their positions based on personal impact. Previously, these same advocates fought vehemently against the Lucas museum plan, blocking the acclaimed filmmaker from building his project after a two-year legal struggle. Their campaign was characterized by concerns over land use and environmental impacts, ended only after the museum's proposal was abandoned.

Now, however, that same group has shifted its support toward the construction of the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, a move that raises questions about the integrity of their environmental advocacy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, has voiced her support for the Obama center, indirectly highlighting the contradiction in the environmentalists’ positions regarding land use.

Critics point out that while the Obama center will necessitate the removal of trees and grass in a community park, the Lucas project sought to utilize an existing parking lot. It begs the question: why is one project acceptable while the other was rigorously opposed? 

This situation has been denounced as an ""environmental no brainer"" by critics, who argue such double standards reflect a troubling trend of hypocrisy within the local political landscape. By favoring projects that align with their political ideologies while dismissing others, the Chicago environmentalists may be undermining their credibility and the very principles they claim to uphold.",3.0,-3.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,314.0,-0.3,-0.009554140127388535

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

In a revealing exchange that underscores the fraught relationship between military leadership and political authority, General Stanley McChrystal, the former Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, found himself at odds with President Barack Obama. Their frequent disagreements escalated to a pivotal moment when McChrystal was summoned to the Oval Office, seemingly anticipating an abrupt end to his illustrious Army career.

During this tense meeting, President Obama confronted McChrystal, accusing him of failing to support his political leadership. In response, the General articulated a narrow interpretation of his allegiance, stating he supported Obama solely in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief. This statement led McChrystal to offer his resignation, a move that reflects deep-seated frustrations within the military regarding the administration's approach to defense issues.

The article presents a stark perspective on Obama's demeanor throughout the encounter, portraying him as dismissive towards McChrystal’s service. The President’s flippant comment suggesting that the General would be content to desecrate his own grave highlights a troubling disregard for military sacrifice and honor.

To this, McChrystal reportedly saluted and added a pointed note that he would not stand in line again after his Army tenure, emphasizing a commitment to uphold his values and principles post-service. This exchange, emblematic of larger conflicts between civilian and military leadership, raises questions about the treatment of military officials in political spheres.

In conclusion, while the article scrutinizes Obama's approach to the military, it also casts a spotlight on McChrystal's integrity and unwavering commitment to respect, embodied in his vow not to compromise his dignity at a future grave site.",7.0,9.0,294.0,0.4666666666666667,0.023809523809523808,308.0,0.9,0.02922077922077922

I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

Charlotte, North Carolina – The recent riots that erupted in Charlotte have drawn scrutiny and concern, revealing a troubling trend: at least 70% of those participating in the unrest are reportedly from out of state. Eyewitness accounts and evidence suggest many of these individuals possessed out-of-state IDs, prompting local officials to question the motivations of the rioters at the heart of the disturbances.

According to the head of the police union, these individuals have been described as ""professional criminals,"" allegedly bused into the city specifically for the purpose of inciting violence and chaos. The characterization of these rioters raises alarm bells regarding the nature of the unrest in Charlotte. As reports continue to unfold, there are growing assertions that the chaos is part of a coordinated effort organized by groups identified as ""communists,"" aiming to manipulate and exploit the Black community for their own revolutionary agenda.

This portrayal of unrest presents a stark contrast to the situation that unfolded in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where local sentiments towards the Black Lives Matter movement appear less sympathetic. In Tulsa, community members engaged in peaceful demonstrations instead of violent protests. Notably, a police officer involved in a controversial shooting incident in the city was charged with Manslaughter. This decisive legal action may have acted to quell potential unrest, illustrating a different pathway for community response to police-involved incidents.

Despite the evident differences between the two cities, the unrest in Charlotte continues to be interpreted by some as the primary manifestation of a larger ideological battle—a struggle that may be intent on igniting race wars across the United States. Critics of the rioters allege that the chaos serves a dual purpose: it not only distracts from genuine dialogue around social justice but also aims to create divisions among communities by diverting the conversation into an atmosphere of hostility and fear.

The narrative that is emerging around these events suggests that the individuals involved in the riots are not authentically concerned with the issues plaguing society, such as systemic racism or police brutality. Instead, they appear motivated by an enthusiastic desire to create turmoil. The evidence being presented aligns with a viewpoint that sees the riots as an integral part of a larger, revolutionary strategy that inherently seeks to undermine societal cohesion.

As allegations of out-of-state involvement swirl, many local residents are left wondering about the implications for their community. Concerns about the integrity of the Black Lives Matter movement have intensified, as citizens question the authenticity of those who seem willing to exploit genuine concerns for personal gain. The portrayal of rioters as unconnected outsiders has sparked fears among residents regarding their community's safety and well-being.

In light of these developments, the calls for unity and constructive dialogue within distinct communities remain paramount. Many advocates urge that the focus should shift from confrontational and chaotic demonstrations to understanding and addressing the legitimate concerns that fuel movements like Black Lives Matter. The challenge now stands in differentiating between those genuinely invested in social change and those who seek to derail meaningful progress through acts of violence and disruption.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of its recent upheaval, it remains vital for local leaders and community members to navigate these complexities with care. As the incidents unfold, the divide between peaceful advocacy and destructive chaos looms larger, underscoring the need for vigilance and unity against external forces intent on creating discord. Indeed, the situation presents an opportunity for reflection on the dual narratives of social movements—whether they foster hope and healing or simply amplify division through spectacle and unrest.",-17.0,-40.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,665.0,-1.7391304347826086,-0.06015037593984962

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

As the Presidential campaign intensifies, Hillary Clinton's health has become a significant concern for voters and critics alike. Once dismissed as a mere ""conspiracy theory,"" her health issues are now taken seriously, with discussions surrounding potential neurological diseases gaining traction. The spotlight on Clinton's condition heightened following her collapse and fainting episode on September 11, further emphasizing the media's struggle to conceal her health problems.

In a striking turn, expert Clif Hite has presented a controversial theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and been replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, such claims would indicate a considerable political cover-up, raising questions about transparency in the campaign.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC.

In a significant revelation, Discover the Networks has identified 187 groups funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros that are actively working to undermine presidential candidates who align with conservative values. Among these emerging organizations is the Common Defense PAC, which explicitly sets its sights on former President Donald Trump.

With a self-proclaimed mission of representing veterans, Common Defense PAC positions itself as an advocacy group dedicated to opposing Trump’s influence in politics. The organization asserts its goal is to mobilize veterans against Trump, tapping into the patriotic sentiment that often accompanies military service. However, the inner workings and leadership transparency of the PAC have come under scrutiny. While the organization touts a leadership team composed of military veterans, it fails to provide necessary contact information for these individuals, raising questions about accountability and representation.

Central to its campaign efforts, Common Defense PAC has been producing and disseminating a series of anti-Trump video advertisements designed to resonate with voters. These efforts are supplemented by their active promotion of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, a slogan that has gained traction on social media platforms and is notably aligned with the advocacy work of MoveOn.org, a progressive political action group.

In a bold attempt to amplify their message, Common Defense PAC participated in a Thunderclap campaign known as #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump. This initiative reached an impressive audience of over 4.5 million people, underscoring the potential for social media to influence political discourse. The PAC’s digital strategy aligns with broader efforts from left-wing organizations to articulate a narrative opposing Trump’s presidency.

Adding another layer to their activities, Common Defense PAC collaborated with MoveOn.org in organizing protests aimed at influencing prominent Republican figures, including a high-profile campaign urging Senator John McCain to rescind his endorsement of Trump. This partnership indicates a strategic alignment with established progressive movements and suggests a concerted effort to unify and mobilize opposition against the former president.

Despite its ambitious agenda, the transparency of Common Defense PAC’s funding raises eyebrows. A review of the PAC's July quarterly filing revealed that it had received funding from only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This limited financial backing raises questions about the sustainability of its operations and the breadth of support it enjoys among the veteran community it claims to represent.

At the helm of Common Defense PAC is Perry O’Brien, the organization’s Director, who is described as a long-time left-wing activist and a conscientious objector with service experience in Afghanistan. Critics have pointed out that the PAC’s leadership structure, significantly shaped by O’Brien’s worldview, may not authentically reflect the perspectives of all veterans, particularly those who may disagree with his anti-Trump stance. This has led to skepticism about the extent to which Common Defense PAC genuinely represents the interests of the veteran population.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the emergence of groups like Common Defense PAC signals a growing effort to mobilize the veteran community on key electoral issues, specifically against figures like Trump. However, the organization's challenges surrounding transparency, funding, and leadership composition remain critical points of discussion. With an apparent backing from Soros, the PAC adds to the complex dynamic of political funding and advocacy in the run-up to the next presidential election.

In an environment rife with polarized political views, the activities of Common Defense PAC demonstrate how financial support and strategic alliances can contribute to shaping narratives and mobilizing voter bases. As they continue to position themselves against Trump, the efficacy and authenticity of their representation of the veteran community will undoubtedly come under further scrutiny in the months ahead.",8.0,21.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,690.0,0.875,0.030434782608695653

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A report resurfacing from CBS has sparked renewed outrage over a decision made by the Obama administration in 2015 to allocate $770 million in taxpayer money for the refurbishment of mosques in various Muslim countries. This funding, which initially drew little attention, is now under scrutiny as critics argue that it deepens America’s financial entanglement with potentially dangerous foreign entities. 

The funds were earmarked for goodwill efforts, intended to improve relations with Muslim communities by refurbishing places of worship. However, skepticism surrounds these initiatives, as critics vehemently claim that such expenditures not only support elements that could be linked to Islamic terrorists but also raise serious questions about the nature and rationale behind U.S. foreign aid. 

Taxpayer advocates, including Jared Thomas, have voiced their dismay over the decision, suggesting that the investment exemplifies fiscal irresponsibility. Thomas likened the expenditure to spending money on a “gigantic credit card,” implying that the nation’s debt is increasing without sufficient justification. The criticism is underscored by the current economic climate, where reports indicate that a significant portion of the American population is struggling financially. Alarmingly, statistics reveal that one-third of the workforce is out of job, leading many to question the wisdom of directing hundreds of millions of dollars overseas for projects such as mosque renovations.

The controversy has deepened following inquiries made by CBS Atlanta News when they sought clarification from the State Department regarding the allocation's purpose and effectiveness. Unfortunately, the State Department did not provide an interview but issued a statement defending the funding as part of a broader U.S. strategy. Officials assert that these financial commitments are essential in combating Islamic extremism and serve to foster better relationships with Islamic leaders in the regions involved. 

While the government describes these endeavors as efforts to promote goodwill, many taxpayers are left wondering why their hard-earned money is being allocated to foreign countries, especially amidst domestic challenges. Critics have pointed to this redistribution of U.S. wealth as a troubling trend, particularly in light of the escalating presence of Muslim refugees in the U.S. This demographic shift is viewed by some as a potentially significant alteration in the nation's political landscape, raising concerns about who is influencing policy and governance as the composition of the population evolves.

The past few years have seen escalating debates surrounding immigration, financial aid, and foreign relations. Some Americans feel it is time to reconsider the country’s approach to international spending, particularly in light of domestic struggles. With many questioning the efficacy of sending funds abroad, particularly to regions fraught with radical elements or unstable governments, the call for more oversight and accountability in the allocation of taxpayer dollars is louder than ever.

As this discourse continues to swell, the implications of the Obama administration's previous decisions are likely to remain a contentious topic in American politics. The stark contrast between domestic economic woes and overseas spending has ignited discussions about the priorities of government funding and the perception of America on the global stage. 

While proponents argue that these funds can be seen as investments in global security and diplomatic relations, critics contend that the expenditures risk enabling groups that could jeopardize U.S. safety and security. This ongoing debate reveals a nation grappling with complex social dynamics, economic difficulties, and concerns over national identity in the face of demographic changes. 

In tapping into the deep-seated concerns about fiscal responsibility, security, and foreign aid, the revival of this issue from 2015 underscores the need for a transparent and accountable approach to how taxpayer money is being spent beyond U.S. borders. The fate of future aid announcements and how they align with the realities faced by citizens back home remains a pivotal point in American socio-economic and political discourse.",-13.0,-17.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,699.0,-0.7391304347826086,-0.024320457796852647

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

They are committed to confronting the fear propagated by these groups head-on. To make their stance clear, billboards have been erected across the country, underscoring the message that Marines are prepared and willing to address the escalating terrorist threats that have become all too prominent within U.S. borders.

This campaign comes at a crucial time, signifying the relevance and importance of demonstrating resolve against increased terrorist activity. Each billboard serves not only as a reminder of the Marine Corps' readiness to protect and defend but also symbolizes a firm rejection of the culture of fear that ISIS and similar terrorist organizations seek to instill. By publicly declaring their preparedness to combat such threats, the Marines aim to undermine the terrorist agenda and instill a sense of courage within the community.

However, this strong position has not come without controversy. The Marine Corps's declaration of readiness has triggered backlash from liberal critics, who argue that the focus should be on appeasing terrorists rather than showcasing American self-defense. Detractors contend that aggressive posturing may exacerbate tensions and create further division. Nevertheless, proponents of the campaign believe that standing firm against these threats is essential for national security and a critical component of public safety.

The message the Marines are conveying through this campaign is that fear should not dictate behavior, and that courage should prevail over intimidation. Each billboard acts as a beacon of resilience, a clear demonstration that the Marines are ready to fight back against any threats posed by extremist groups like ISIS. 

As the threat from such organizations continues to loom, the United States Marine Corps remains steadfast in its mission. Through these efforts, they reiterate a commitment to countering ISIS and protecting the values upon which the nation stands. The call to action is clear: the Marines are prepared to confront the challenges ahead.",-53.0,-27.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,458.0,-1.5,-0.05895196506550218

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is reeling from significant unrest following a wave of rioting that has swept through the city, marked by looting, arson, and violent crimes. The disturbances have not only disrupted daily life but have also drawn the attention of state officials who responded with immediate action to restore peace.

In light of the escalating violence, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to assist local law enforcement in controlling the situation. This decision reflects the severity of the circumstances and the urgent need for enhanced security measures to protect the city and its residents.

In a further announcement aimed at discouraging future unrest, state officials revealed that individuals caught participating in rioting or engaging in violent behavior will face severe consequences, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This directive underscores the state’s commitment to holding individuals accountable for their actions during this tumultuous period.

The situation is compounded by the involvement of minor children in the rioting. Under new measures, minors participating in violent activities will be subjected to the same penalties as adults. Additionally, parents of these minors could find themselves facing not only the loss of state benefits but also referrals to social services. In extreme cases, they may even risk losing custody of their children if they fail to exercise proper oversight.

City official Wilson Stewart emphasized the importance of parental responsibility, stressing that parents must monitor their children’s activities closely and adhere to newly established curfews. Stewart’s comments reflect a broader narrative urging families to take an active stance against the chaos engulfing their communities.

To enforce this message and help restore order, a curfew has been implemented across Charlotte. The curfew is intended to deter further violent protests and encourage citizens, particularly parents, to take proactive steps in ensuring the safety and well-being of their families. The hope among officials is that this curfew will not only maintain peace but also foster a sense of responsibility among families regarding their children's whereabouts and actions.

As the city grapples with the aftermath of the riots and the looming penalties for those involved, officials remain optimistic that these measures will lead to a decrease in future incidents of violence. By addressing the root causes of the unrest and promoting responsible parenting, they aim to cultivate a safer environment for all residents of Charlotte.

In the face of adversity, community leaders and officials are rallying to reinforce the values of accountability and responsibility. The hope is that through these efforts, Charlotte will emerge from this turbulent period stronger and more unified, with a renewed commitment to peace and order.",-33.0,0.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,503.0,0.0,0.0

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

The FBI's investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email scandal has ignited significant backlash from various quarters, particularly targeting the actions of FBI Director James Comey. Critics argue that Comey's handling of the inquiry has raised troubling questions, and calls for accountability have intensified as a result.

Comey has found himself in a precarious position following the decision to grant immunity to some of Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills. This controversial move has drawn sharp criticism, particularly considering Mills's lack of cooperation during the investigation. Observers are questioning the implications of this immunity and what it reveals about the underlying motivations of those involved.

The legislative branch is stepping up to assess whether Comey's actions were warranted or if they raised ethical and procedural issues. In response to mounting pressure, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28. This forum will serve as a platform to evaluate Comey's handling of the investigation as lawmakers seek clarity regarding the circumstances surrounding the email scandal.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has taken a particularly hard stance against Comey, vocally demanding his resignation. DiGenova has condemned the investigation as insufficient, suggesting that it resembles a ""protected investigation"" rather than a genuine and thorough inquiry into the allegations at hand. His assertions reflect a broader sentiment among critics who believe that the FBI has not adequately pursued accountability in this high-profile case.

As Congress gears up for the upcoming hearing, the focus remains on Comey and his decisions during the investigation. Recent developments have seen him issued a subpoena mandating the provision of documents related to the email scandal. Prominent figures like Lamar Smith of Texas have played a role in compelling Comey to comply with the request for these critical documents, amidst calls for transparency surrounding the inquiry.

Questions concerning Comey’s loyalty to Clinton have also surfaced, adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing scrutiny of the investigation. Critics have raised concerns over the potential personal and professional risks Comey may have felt he needed to navigate in order to protect the former Secretary of State. As the narrative unfolds, lawmakers are increasingly faced with the imperative of addressing the perceived inconsistencies in the investigative process.

The convergence of these events underscores a growing belief among some factions that accountability for the investigation is necessary. The scheduled hearing on September 28 will be pivotal in determining whether Comey’s actions will lead to significant repercussions, both for himself and potentially for those involved in the scandal. As investigations continue and questions linger, the atmosphere surrounding the FBI's inquiry into Clinton’s emails remains charged and contentious, with many citizens closely watching the unfolding developments.",-17.0,-33.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,515.0,-1.65,-0.06407766990291262

The ongoing support for Saudi Arabia has come under intense scrutiny, particularly in light of its alleged involvement in terrorism and gross human rights abuses. Critics are raising alarms over the Kingdom's dark connections to human trafficking, including alarming reports of Saudi nationals participating in the auctioning of ISIS sex slaves, which highlights a disturbing chapter in the already troubling narrative of inhumane trafficking practices.

According to a shocking assertion, Saudi Arabia has been involved in the auctioning of women, particularly Yazidi and Christian victims, as sex slaves. These horrific acts allegedly take place during public auctions that involve not only Iraqis and Syrians but also Saudis and Westerners. This disconcerting revelation not only sheds light on the cruelty experienced by these victims but also calls into question the moral compass of nations that continue to align themselves with Saudi interests.

Adding to the controversy, claims have surfaced suggesting that the Saudi deputy crown prince contributed 20% of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign funding. This revelation raises significant ethical concerns about accepting financial support from nations widely perceived as enemies, specifically those from the Middle East and various authoritarian regimes. The suggestion that such funding could be linked to a political campaign exemplifies the complications that arise when politics becomes intertwined with questionable partnerships.

The article also expresses outrage over the complicity of Western nations, particularly the UK, in selling weapons to Saudi Arabia. This relationship raises significant questions about the ethical implications of providing military support to a government implicated in atrocities. Such complicity not only undermines the efforts of those fighting against terrorism and human rights abuses but also implicates Western nations in the perpetuation of these heinous acts.

Hillary Clinton's past associations with, and acceptance of donations from, Saudi Arabia have also come under fire. Critics argue that supporting and accepting funds from a nation known for its reprehensible actions is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of a political leader. The growing sentiment suggests that any connection with such regimes serves only to perpetuate the cycle of violence and oppression, particularly affecting vulnerable populations like women and children.

Moreover, the assertion that both Saudi Arabia and Russia are supporters of ISIS adds another layer to the complex web of international relations. This viewpoint paints a picture of manipulation by global powers, using the chaos of terrorism to further their own agendas. Such alliances threaten to undermine efforts aimed at combating terrorism and fostering global peace.

In light of these allegations and connections, the urgency to address the sale and trafficking of women and children cannot be overstated. The trafficking of individuals, particularly in conflict zones, demands immediate action and a united response from the global community. The inhumane treatment of victims, often relegated to mere commodities in the eyes of traffickers, poses a profound moral challenge that demands attention and action from governments and civil societies alike.

As discussions continue regarding support for Saudi Arabia and its implications, it is essential for policymakers, advocates, and the public to reflect on the moral obligations we hold towards those most vulnerable. Addressing the sales and trafficking of women, particularly in the context of larger geopolitical interests, requires a concerted effort to uphold human rights and ensure justice for victims of such atrocities.

In conclusion, the continued support for Saudi Arabia, despite its alleged complicity in human rights violations and the trafficking of women as sex slaves, calls for deep reflection and reevaluation of international alliances. It becomes imperative to confront the ethical dilemmas presented by such relationships and prioritize the protection of human rights above all else. As the world watches, the spotlight on these grave issues forces us to question our own complicity and commitment to justice for those most in need.",-30.0,-50.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,700.0,-2.0,-0.07142857142857142
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The inaugural presidential debate saw intense exchanges between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and her Republican challenger, Donald Trump, as they each sought to capture the attention of American voters. The debate, intended to showcase the candidates' policies and personalities, instead became notable for its heated confrontations and contentious moments.

NBC moderator Lester Holt's performance attracted significant backlash following the debate. Critics pointed out that he frequently interrupted Trump during his responses, often to offer ""fact-checks"" that were not only relentless but at times inaccurate. One of the most contentious exchanges centered around the Iraq War, where Holt insisted that Trump had previously supported the invasion, leading to notable tension on stage. Trump staunchly denied this assertion, pushing back against what he described as a misrepresentation of his stance.

Interestingly, Holt did not extend the same scrutiny to Clinton regarding her vote for the Iraq War, raising questions about media bias during an event meant to present both candidates on equal footing. The uneven treatment became a focal point for many observers following the debate, who scrutinized whether Holt was more aggressive in questioning Trump than Clinton.

In a follow-up interview, Trump maintained his position that he had reservations about the Iraq War from the beginning. This statement contradicted Holt's claims during the debate and revealed a nuanced understanding from Trump regarding the complexities of wartime decisions. He expressed that while he was uncertain about the war, it was crucial to exercise caution and consider international pressures before making significant military commitments.

The media's portrayal of the debate has also come under fire, with many arguing that it aimed to undermine Trump's reputation and credibility. Commentators have suggested that the narrative crafted by various outlets served to paint Trump in a negative light, diverting attention from the policy discussions intended by the debate format.

Throughout the evening's exchanges, Trump demonstrated remarkable composure, standing firm against both Clinton's critiques and the media narratives that followed. His ability to maintain poise in the face of intermittent interruptions and pointed questioning showcased a resilience that impressed many of his supporters.

As the debate concluded, the implications of the media's handling of the event and Holt's questioning technique left many contemplating the broader impact on public perception of the candidates. With the presidential race heating up, both candidates will likely be keenly aware of the significance of their portrayals in the media and the audience's reaction as they move forward in the campaign.",-9.0,-17.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,472.0,-1.0,-0.036016949152542374
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

A recent article from Breitbart has scrutinized the longstanding ""Birther"" movement, revisiting the controversial claims about Barack Obama's birthplace and early life. At the heart of the article is a 2004 Associated Press piece that referred to Obama as ""Kenyan-born,"" a statement that has fueled ongoing debate about the former president's origins. This AP report accompanied Obama's rise to the Illinois Senate seat after his opponent, Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race due to a scandal.

Obama's candidacy was significantly bolstered by the controversy surrounding Ryan, paving the way for a more charismatic and untainted figure to enter the political arena. However, throughout his campaign, Obama did not address or refute the claim of being ""Kenyan-born,"" raising questions about the implications of his silence on the matter.

Further complicating the narrative, a promotional booklet from 1991 issued by Obama’s literary agency, Acton & Dystel, describes him as being “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” This booklet was initially created to promote Obama's unpublished first book, ""Journeys in Black and White,"" which he ultimately replaced with his well-known autobiography, “Dreams from My Father.” The inclusion of such a statement in the promotional materials has led to intensified scrutiny over the consistency and authenticity of Obama's accounts of his birthplace.

The article challenges the credibility of Obama's claims, suggesting a dissonance between his narrative as outlined in the literary agency booklet and the narrative that emerged during his presidential campaign. Critics argue that if Obama’s assertion of having been born in America is valid, there should be no motive for him to fabricate a foreign origin, particularly for personal gain.

As the discussion continues, the article implies that if the allegations of Obama’s Kenyan birth are indeed false, then the validity of his American citizenship comes into question. This line of reasoning fuels ongoing debates in political circles and among supporters and detractors alike, prompting a deeper examination of both personal narratives and national identity.

As the discourse evolves, these persistent questions regarding Barack Obama’s birthplace and early biography demonstrate how narratives can shape public perception and the complexities within political identity in America. The implications of these claims extend beyond individual experience, sparking broader conversations about citizenry and the integrity of personal history in the fabric of American politics.",-18.0,-5.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,456.0,-0.4166666666666667,-0.010964912280701754

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

The recent presidential debate involving Hillary Clinton has ignited a whirlwind of discussion and scrutiny, particularly surrounding the performance of the moderator and the circumstances surrounding Clinton's presentation. Critics have raised concerns about the perceived bias of the moderator, claiming a distinct favoritism toward Clinton during the proceedings. This backdrop of alleged partiality has amplified the intensity of the debate, with observers scrutinizing every detail of the candidates' performances.

Despite the controversies surrounding the debate, many noted that Hillary Clinton appeared more prepared than usual, which may have contributed to a more confident performance. Throughout the evening, she notably avoided her characteristic coughing episodes that have previously drawn attention and speculation in past public appearances. This apparent poise was bolstered by a polished delivery that contrasted sharply with the allegations of bias in her favor.

However, the night took a turn into the realm of the peculiar when social media users began buzzing with rumors about a potential flesh-colored device visible in Clinton's ear during the discussion. The speculative nature of these discussions led to questions regarding whether the object was an earpiece or yet another type of accessory used during the broadcast. The imagery sparked a plethora of theories online, with some commentators humorously suggesting that Clinton might require assistance to articulate her thoughts without ""liars"" assisting her as if using an earpiece.

Clinton's campaign spokesperson, Nick Merrill, was quick to interject into the growing speculation. In a statement addressing the controversy, Merrill asserted that the object in question was merely a product of lighting—namely, a reflection caused by TV lights or a flash. His remarks attempted to quell the rising concerns and dismiss accusations of clandestine communication devices being utilized during the debate.

Adding further intrigue to the debate were the revelations from leaked emails connecting Clinton and her aide, Huma Abedin. These emails raised questions regarding whether Clinton had indeed been in possession of an earpiece, which only served to intensify the ongoing discourse surrounding her technological aids during such pivotal political encounters.

As speculation continues, it's essential to recognize that there is currently no concrete proof to verify the existence or legitimacy of the purported earpiece. Many observers remain divided, with some attributing what they perceived as the suspicious object in Clinton's ear to light effects inherent to the studio environment. 

The combination of the moderator's alleged bias, Clinton's unexpectedly strong performance, and swirling rumors of technological assistance paints a complicated picture for the electorate. As the dust settles, the implications of this debate will likely linger on social media platforms and public discourse, prompting questions about transparency and the integrity of televised political debates. The public's fascination with the nature of the object visible in Clinton's ear underscores the lengths to which speculation can travel, especially in an era where image often intertwines with perception in politics.",-5.0,-10.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,538.0,-0.5263157894736842,-0.01858736059479554
