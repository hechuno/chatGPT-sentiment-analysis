Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

In a recent segment on CNN, former President Bill Clinton stirred tensions within political circles by discussing the activities of the Clinton Foundation, prompting discussions about the implications for his wife, Hillary Clinton's ongoing campaign. Bill Clinton's comments suggested a casual acknowledgment of donor requests for favors, framing the relationship between the foundation and its benefactors as “natural.” He further stressed, however, that such requests do not guarantee that favors will be granted—a point that highlights the complexities of political fundraising and ethics.

The context of these remarks derives from an ongoing discourse surrounding allegations regarding the foundation's operations. Leaked emails have emerged, indicating that certain donors had indeed received meetings with Secretary Clinton during her tenure. However, Bill Clinton's assertion that no concrete evidence of pay-to-play activities exists aims to quell rising concerns. This lack of evidence stands in stark contrast to the headlines generated by the Trump Foundation’s dealings, which have come under scrutiny for potentially different reasons.

Donald Trump, unlike Bill Clinton, has not contributed personally to his own foundation since 2008. Reports suggest that Trump has been accused of misusing charity funds for personal benefits, such as acquiring art pieces and sports memorabilia, raising ethical questions about the nature and conduct of his philanthropic efforts. These allegations have led New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to initiate an investigation into the Trump Foundation concerning possible violations of charity laws.

The disparity in media coverage between the two foundations has drawn attention and has been a point of contention among commentators. Media Matters has pointed out what it describes as a double standard in how the media has reported on the two candidates' charitable organizations. The organization identified that Hillary Clinton's health issues have garnered a significantly greater amount of media scrutiny compared to the potentially more severe controversies surrounding Trump’s activities with his foundation.

Critics of the media's approach argue that a disproportionate focus on relatively minor issues connected to Clinton has overshadowed more severe scandals associated with Trump, potentially impacting Hillary Clinton's campaign trajectory. This pattern of reporting has raised concerns among political analysts about the implications for voters' perceptions as they navigate the political landscape leading up to the elections.

Bill Clinton’s remarks, coupled with the ongoing investigations into his counterpart’s foundation, underscore the sharply divided perceptions of ethics in political philanthropy. As controversies swirl around both candidates, the ramifications for Hillary Clinton’s campaign could be significant, especially if media narratives continue to emphasize her vulnerabilities while downplaying the pressing issues surrounding Trump's charitable practices.

With the election fast approaching, both candidates are grappling with their charitable legacies and the public's expectations regarding transparency and integrity. The differing approaches to foundation management and donor relationships serve as a focal point in contemporary political discourse, raising questions about the influences of money in politics and the adequacy of current regulatory frameworks.

In this politically charged environment, voters are left to discern the implications of such revelations. As issues tied to charity and the transparency of political contributions shape public opinion, both campaigns will need to address the concerns raised by these allegations adeptly. The political landscape remains precarious, and how both parties navigate these discussions will likely have profound implications on their respective paths to the presidency. 

As the political battle intensifies, it is clear that the narratives surrounding the Clinton Foundation and the Trump Foundation will remain at the forefront of public discourse, influencing the opinions of voters who seek ethical leadership and accountability from their potential leaders. The election may very well hinge on how skillfully each campaign manages these evolving discussions in the weeks leading to the polls.",6.0,-2.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,694.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.002881844380403458
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has emerged, igniting controversy around the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), an organization tied to former President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The report alleges that CHAI distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, purportedly exacerbating mortality and morbidity risks among patients reliant on these medications for their health and well-being. 

The report, subtitled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was spearheaded by Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee, bringing renewed scrutiny to the Clinton Foundation's healthcare endeavors. CHAI has long been regarded as a central initiative of the Clinton Foundation, aimed specifically at aiding victims of HIV/AIDS. However, the allegations raised in the report have now placed a dark cloud over its operations and effectiveness.

At the heart of the report is an examination of CHAI’s connections with the Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has been identified as one of CHAI's primary distributors of HIV/AIDS medications. Ranbaxy once garnered a significant reputation for its role in making affordable medications available in developing countries. Yet, its history is marred by serious legal and ethical concerns. 

Key to the narrative is Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower and former employee of Ranbaxy. Thakur played a pivotal role in facilitating a landmark lawsuit against the company, shedding light on what he described as fraudulent practices. The company's fraudulent activities led Ranbaxy to plead guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts related to defrauding customers and introducing adulterated drugs into the market, resulting in a staggering $500 million penalty. The implications of these actions were dire; the Department of Justice previously noted that Ranbaxy’s malpractices compromised patient safety, exposing individuals to increased health risks.

Reflecting the serious nature of these allegations, Rep. Blackburn has questioned the human costs associated with the distribution of compromised drugs by CHAI. Her inquiry has opened the door to potential legal and regulatory ramifications that could resurface during the upcoming presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. The timing and implications of the report could serve as a focal point for critics who have long scrutinized the role of the Clinton Foundation in global health initiatives.

The report further unfolds as it reveals questionable connections between Bill Clinton and Indian-American individuals linked to previous investigations conducted by both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such revelations raise pressing questions regarding the oversight and integrity of CHAI’s operations during its dealings with Ranbaxy, particularly in light of the pharmaceutical firm’s history of quality control issues.

Despite these concerns, CHAI maintained its partnership with Ranbaxy, which faced significant challenges regarding the quality of its drugs. A report by the investigative journalism nonprofit ProPublica estimated that by 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated a substantial $9 million to Ranbaxy, leading to the distribution of over 1.8 million drug packages aimed at combating HIV/AIDS in affected regions. 

Thakur underscored the critical importance of effective anti-retroviral drugs in stabilizing the health of AIDS patients, stating that inadequate treatments can lead to devastating consequences for individuals already struggling with this chronic illness. Alarmingly, the World Health Organization reported issues with Ranbaxy-sourced drugs shortly after CHAI’s collaboration with the company began in 2004, raising questions about the efficacy and safety of the treatment options being provided through the initiative.

Despite Ranbaxy’s prohibition from selling drugs in the United States, CHAI continues to laud and distribute the company’s HIV/AIDS medications. This ongoing partnership has led to stark criticism and a call for accountability concerning the health of patients in need. Notably, Thakur made attempts to engage CHAI officials about these pressing concerns but has reported receiving no meaningful response, further igniting frustration and skepticism regarding the initiative’s commitment to patient safety.

CHAI operated under the auspices of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it became a separate entity. Even so, the ties between CHAI and the Clinton Foundation have persisted, with many questioning the motivations and consequences of these connections during sensitive health crises. A congressional study highlighted another alarming potential misstep by Bill Clinton: an executive order issued in 2000 that relaxed quality standards regarding intellectual property laws for HIV/AIDS medications. This could further implicate the former president in the unfolding narrative surrounding the questionable drug distribution practices tied to CHAI.

In 2003, CHAI publicly announced its intention to distribute generic HIV drugs from several foreign manufacturers, prominently including Ranbaxy. This decision was framed as a measure to increase access to life-saving medications, yet the ongoing controversies have raised doubts about the true nature of these initiatives and their potential impact on the lives of countless individuals battling HIV/AIDS.

The repercussions of the allegations laid out in the report also extend to Ranbaxy's financial success, as the company profited significantly from its association with CHAI. Furthermore, they received lucrative contracts from the U.S. government to provide medications, a dynamic that raises questions surrounding both ethical practices and the integrity of healthcare delivery models.

In light of these disturbing findings, Blackburn has emphasized the emotional toll that this situation has exacted on healthcare workers and patients alike. Many have endured immense suffering and false hopes, spotlighting the human side of these complex allegations. The emotional burden borne by patients and healthcare providers alike cannot be overstated; the prospect of receiving diluted medications during efforts to combat a disease as challenging as AIDS evokes a profound sense of despair and injustice.

As the report continues to circulate and draw attention, it serves as a critical reminder of the importance of oversight and accountability in public health initiatives, particularly those operating in regions heavily impacted by disease. The allegations confronting CHAI and the broader implications for the Clinton Foundation underscore a need for scrutiny in healthcare practices, ensuring that patients receive effective, safe, and reliable treatment.

Debates surrounding the integrity and effectiveness of healthcare initiatives like CHAI are not merely academic; they resonate deeply within communities that rely on these programs for their very survival. As allegations swirl and investigations loom, the trajectory of both Bill Clinton's legacy and the fate of the Clinton Foundation's healthcare efforts hangs precariously in the balance.

With growing concerns about the ethical implications of the report and its findings, it is clear that this issue will continue to command attention in the media, among health organizations, and potentially within the political arena as well. As more details come to light and potential ramifications become clearer, stakeholders from various sectors will likely engage in debates surrounding accountability, transparency, and the moral obligations of organizations like the Clinton Foundation to prioritize patient safety above all else. 

The ramifications of these allegations may stretch well beyond just the Clinton Foundation. They raise fundamental questions about how healthcare initiatives are funded, monitored, and implemented in regions where the stakes are not only high in terms of public health but also in relation to public trust. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the conversation surrounding CHAI, Ranbaxy, and the plight of AIDS patients is only just beginning.",-6.0,-12.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1318.0,-0.2727272727272727,-0.009104704097116844
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a surprising turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed just moments before entering her van following a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York City. This incident sparked immediate concern among attendees and the public alike regarding her health, particularly as she has been a notable figure in American politics for decades.

The situation took a twist that few expected. Shortly after the collapse, Hillary Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment. To the surprise of many, she appeared noticeably healthier and more energetic than earlier that day. This sudden transformation led to rampant speculation regarding her condition and even her identity.

Observers noted marked differences in Clinton's appearance during her visit to Chelsea's apartment. Description of her seemed lighter and more vibrant, raising eyebrows regarding her physical changes. Particularly striking was the noticeable alteration in her nose, which had transitioned from its previous Nordic type to a more prominent Roman shape. This distinct change has led to whispers that the woman spotted at Chelsea’s residence might not be the Hillary Clinton known to many.

Adding fuel to the fire of speculation was the observation that the ""new"" Hillary exhibited a youthful demeanor, seemingly devoid of signs of aging that have characterized her previous appearances. Specifically, the mole above her lip, a well-known feature of the former Secretary of State, was conspicuously absent. This unusual occurrence led to rampant speculation about the authenticity of the person being presented to the public.

As conversations surrounding her health escalate, questions arise about Clinton’s ability to campaign effectively and partake in upcoming debates with Donald Trump. Reports indicating fundamental changes in her physical form have left many wondering whether the real Hillary Clinton will emerge to lead her potential presidential campaign or if a carefully curated double may take her place.

This situation calls for observers to closely monitor Clinton’s public engagements for any further signs of aging or inconsistencies that could indicate the presence of a double. The potential outcomes of such a scenario could dramatically shift the political landscape. The legitimacy of a Clinton administration operating largely absent of the actual Hillary raises new anxieties about authenticity and power dynamics within the government.

The broader implications of this situation may also redirect public observation to past events, particularly concerns that emerged about former President Barack Obama's administration. Indeed, the recent revelations have created a discussion on the degree to which authenticity within political leadership can influence public trust and governance.

With uncertainty looming over the former Secretary of State's candidacy, a ground swell of dialogue has begun—a dialogue centered not just on her health but also on the implications of her potential non-participation in significant political roles. The specter of a political figure operating behind the scenes, whether due to health issues or other determinations, presents complexities that could challenge perceptions of democratic governance.

Amidst this whirlwind of speculation, it is essential to emphasize that the views shared in this discourse are speculative and represent the author's perspective. The actual state of Hillary Clinton's health and her future plans remain undisclosed, leaving the public to ponder the realities behind her appearances.

As the political landscape evolves, one thing is clear: the events surrounding Hillary Clinton's health scare have opened a Pandora's box of questions about authenticity, registration of identity, and the foundations upon which political figures build their legacies. The stakes are high, and the impact will reverberate through upcoming campaigns and the political theater in which they transpire. Whether the real Hillary Clinton will reclaim her position on the national stage or if a double will carry forth the torch remains to be seen. For now, America watches with bated breath as this intricate narrative unfolds.",8.0,12.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,709.0,0.42857142857142855,0.01692524682651622
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In a political climate increasingly charged with tension surrounding immigration and terrorism, former President Donald Trump has found himself at the center of a controversy for his incendiary statements regarding these pressing issues. Critics have labeled some of his proposals and comments as ""deplorable,"" suggesting they could undermine societal values and promote discrimination.

One of the most contentious suggestions made by Trump involves the construction of a border wall. He has famously characterized undocumented immigrants entering the United States as “rapists” and “drug dealers.” This stark language has not only polarized public opinion but has also fueled debates about racial and ethnic profiling within the immigration system.

In a series of statements that have drawn intense scrutiny, Trump proposed the creation of a national registry for Muslims living in the United States. This idea was accompanied by a recommendation that Muslims should wear identification badges to distinguish themselves. The implications of such comments have raised alarms among civil liberties advocates, who warn that this could lead to renewed discrimination against the Muslim community.

Trump’s rhetoric escalated further with advocates suggesting extreme measures, including the potential rounding up of Muslims into concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” Such proposals have echoed some of the darkest chapters in history, igniting a conversation around the boundaries of national security and racial profiling.

Additionally, Trump has made alarming assertions regarding the tactics to be used in combating terrorism. He controversially suggested that families of terrorists abroad should be executed, a statement that invokes a chilling notion of collective punishment. This has led many to question the morality and legality of such actions, considering the ramifications it could have on the rule of law and human rights.

Echoing his sentiments regarding national security, Trump has expressed concerns about the narratives surrounding the threats posed by terrorism. He claims to be fighting against what he perceives as the flawed narratives of former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom he accuses of instituting policies that purportedly facilitated the entry of dangerous immigrants into the country. He has particularly criticized the increased resettlement of Syrian refugees, framing it as a failure of these past administrations to protect American citizens.

Despite the alarmist tone he adopts, Trump's characterization of terrorists as an existential threat necessitates a decisive response. He emphasizes the dangers that such groups pose, framing it as a matter of American security. This has appealed to certain segments of the population that fear the growing influence of terrorism on American soil.

However, Trump's comments have also sown seeds of fear and suspicion towards the Muslim community. He has implied that Muslims could be complicit in terrorism if they fail to report suspected terrorists, raising concerns about the potential for widespread discrimination and mistrust against innocent people. Critics warn that such rhetoric could foster an environment where individuals are judged not by their actions but by their religious identity.

What stands out in Trump’s rhetoric is an unstable and aggressive approach to conflict. His willingness to suggest extreme measures underscores a belief that brutal tactics may be justified in the pursuit of national security. This has led many to argue that such statements reflect an alarming trend towards militarism and a disregard for civil liberties. 

Moreover, recent events have prompted further reflection on Trump's assertions. Notably, investigations into recent attacks in New York and New Jersey revealed that the assailants were American citizens exercising their constitutional rights. This raises questions about the effectiveness of punitive measures against specific communities and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing terrorism within the U.S.

Ultimately, the combination of Trump's extreme proposals and his incendiary language has drawn warnings from various quarters.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama addressed the United Nations, promoting the idea of a One World Government.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Allegations of pay-to-play corruption involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation have come under scrutiny as critics raise concerns regarding the foundation’s operations and financial practices. Amidst these controversies, the Clinton campaign has positioned the foundation's purported positive impact as a central response to the unfolding scrutiny.

Critics argue that the Clinton Foundation, rather than being a true charitable organization, effectively operates as a profit-making entity benefiting the Clinton family and their associates. This assertion is supported by troubling financial data from 2014. According to IRS filings, only 5.7% of the foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants, raising questions about the organization’s true commitment to philanthropy. 

In 2014, the foundation spent nearly $91.3 million, out of which a mere $5.2 million was directed towards charitable grants. This financial disbursement raises significant concerns, especially when compared to the significant amounts spent on salaries and employee benefits, which totaled $34.8 million. Additionally, another $50.4 million was allocated to “other expenses.” 

Despite experiencing a $30 million increase in revenue in 2014, the foundation significantly reduced its charitable grants by 40% when juxtaposed with the previous year, 2013. Observers noted that both salaries and employee benefits, as well as ‘other expenses,’ saw an increase of $5 million each in the same year, further complicating the foundation's financial narrative.

Critics of the Clintons assert that these monetary trends suggest a troubling pattern, wherein Hillary Clinton’s position as Secretary of State may have been used to solicit donations in return for political favors. This allegation further fuels ongoing debates regarding the integrity of the foundation and its operations during her tenure in government.

As this story continues to unfold, the implications of these allegations remain serious, warranting scrutiny from both the public and political analysts alike. The views expressed in this article represent those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. The outcome of these allegations could have significant repercussions for the reputation of Hillary Clinton and the larger narrative surrounding the Clinton Foundation.",25.0,6.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,402.0,0.42857142857142855,0.014925373134328358
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

The rally took place at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, North Carolina, drawing attention amidst ongoing speculation about her health.

Initially, her campaign attributed the convulsion to heat exhaustion; however, scrutiny arose when it was revealed that the temperature in NYC at the time was a comfortable 74 degrees. Instead of heading to a hospital for medical evaluation, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment, prompting further questions regarding the nature of her condition.

As Clinton addressed supporters at the Greensboro rally, criticisms emerged surrounding the authenticity of the event. Some observers pointed to initial footage from the rally that suggested audience members appeared distracted and focused on matters other than Clinton herself. A subsequent analysis of a second video led to claims that the audience may have been fabricated, raising eyebrows among critics.

To substantiate the concerns, a C-Span video was referenced, with assertions that the original recordings had not been altered or manipulated. As the fallout from both the New York incident and the Greensboro rally continues, questions linger about the state of Clinton’s health and the legitimacy of her campaign events in the lead-up to the elections.",4.0,-1.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,247.0,-0.1111111111111111,-0.004048582995951417
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the fictional movie titled “Weekend at Chelsea’s” looms closer to its release date, the buzz around this comedic take on a political figure reflects broader discussions surrounding Hillary Clinton. The film’s title, an allusion to the classic “Weekend at Bernie’s,” invites laughs, but underneath the surface lies a serious narrative entwined with Clinton’s own controversial history and ongoing health concerns that many believe might hinder her future political aspirations.

For years, criticism has surrounded various media outlets, particularly CNN, for what is perceived as an unwavering support of Hillary Clinton. Critics argue that this support has enabled a narrative that glosses over significant issues related to her health and political integrity. Allegations have surfaced suggesting that Clinton suffers from severe health issues, contradicting her campaign’s claims of merely “minor” ailments. This narrative demands a closer look, especially considering the historical context of medical emergencies that have plagued Clinton, often accompanied by references to a ""mystery man"" physician whose identity has remained elusive.

The speculation regarding Clinton’s health issues has escalated, with observers suggesting that she may be dealing with serious conditions such as seizures or even Parkinson’s disease. The symptoms associated with these conditions, coupled with the medical treatments she has received, have raised eyebrows and fueled conversation about the authenticity of her public persona. In this environment, calls for transparency from the Clinton campaign regarding her health have gained traction, with many advocating for a clearer picture of her condition as she navigates the politically charged atmosphere in modern America.

Concerns about Clinton's health extend beyond mere speculation; they intersect with deeper issues of trust. Over the course of her political career, there has been a growing assertion that Clinton's history of perceived dishonesty has led to an erosion of trust regarding her fitness for the presidency. As she seeks to return to political relevance, particularly amid a landscape marked by skepticism, this challenge looms large.

While there is no made glee found in Clinton’s suffering, it is difficult to ignore the impact her health may have on her political ambitions, especially as poll numbers appear to reflect a decline. In a world where every misstep is magnified, Clinton's remarks about Donald Trump’s supporters have attracted criticism and are often deemed hypocritical, further damaging her image in the eyes of a divided electorate. The implications of her comments resonate not only within political circles but also across broad swaths of the American public, leaving many questioning her sincerity and commitment to unity.

Throughout her career, historical references have consistently pointed to a pattern of hypocrisy in Clinton's political affiliations and statements. This history complicates the narrative surrounding her political aspirations, creating a tangled web of ambition, credibility, and the realities of her health struggles. While empathy for her situation is evident, it exists alongside a critique of her continued pursuits in the political arena, where the standards of transparency and trust have shifted dramatically.

Despite the challenges she faces—both health-related and reputational—the specter of Clinton’s potential return to political power remains a topic of speculation. Some observers suggest that, against all odds, her political career might not be finished. Nevertheless, the hope for many lies in the desire for an end to her contentious political journey, one that has been marked by both triumph and tribulation.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the conversation surrounding Hillary Clinton remains complex. While it is essential to acknowledge her health struggles, the intersection of personal issues and political ambitions cannot be overlooked. In a climate where political figures are held to rigorous standards, Clinton’s legacy, compounded by her health challenges, begs the question: what does the future hold for her?

Ultimately, the desire for Hillary Clinton is rooted not only in compassion towards her health but also in a shared wish for her to find a fulfilling life outside of the political arena. The ongoing narrative, punctuated by anticipation for “Weekend at Chelsea’s,” reminds us that the crossroads of health and politics are fraught with challenges and uncertainties. As audiences await the fictionalized retelling of a perhaps-too-real life, the realities of Clinton’s health and perceptions of her political integrity remain at center stage. The hope is for transparency, honesty, and ultimately, a healthier and more vibrant existence, be it in or out of the political spotlight.",-18.0,-2.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,859.0,-0.07142857142857142,-0.002328288707799767

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant and frank address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama shared a disheartening outlook on the ongoing struggle against ISIS and various Islamic extremist groups. His remarks highlighted significant challenges that the United States and the international community face in combating these militant organizations effectively.

In a striking revelation, Obama asserted that the U.S. military struggles to maintain a competitive edge against the rising strength and number of militants affiliated with the Islamic State. Citing the notable escalation in military capabilities within these extremist groups, he underscored a sense of urgency regarding the complexities of the current global security landscape.

A crucial aspect of Obama’s address was his emphasis on the limitations of external powers in resolving conflicts among diverse religious and ethnic communities. He articulated the perspective that attempting to impose harmony on disparate groups through military might is often futile and counterproductive. Obama called for a more nuanced understanding of the nature of these conflicts, advocating for transparency in discussions about the realities on the ground.

While acknowledging the inevitability of military involvement in certain situations, Obama expressed a bleak outlook on the conflict in Syria, labeling it as an arena where an ultimate military victory is unattainable. This perspective aligns with his broader advocacy for prioritizing diplomatic efforts, humanitarian aid, and facilitating political negotiations over reliance solely on military solutions.

In a pointed critique, Obama denounced liberal viewpoints that underestimate the connection between radical Islam and the violence it engenders. He warned that dismissing this link could exacerbate the severity of the threat posed by extremist ideologies. His comments reflected a call for realism in addressing the challenges associated with radical groups.

The former president urged the international community to take immediate and decisive action against the rise of radical Islam. He voiced concerns that complacency in recognizing and responding to the threat could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Obama’s words serve as a reminder of the critical need for engagement and vigilance to combat the pervasive influence of extremist ideologies.

The overarching message from Obama’s final address to the U.N. Assembly called for a collaborative approach in creating a more peaceful and stable world. He highlighted the necessity of fostering international cooperation to ""build rather than destroy,"" emphasizing that lasting solutions require collective effort rather than unilateral military actions.

In conclusion, Obama’s address painted a stark picture of the challenges confronting world leaders in their fight against radical extremism. His advocacy for diplomacy, humanitarian support, and acknowledgment of the complexities of these conflicts underscores a strategic shift needed in global anti-terrorism efforts. As nations navigate the treacherous waters of extremism, the call for unity and honesty in addressing these issues remains paramount for future progress.",-5.0,-11.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,515.0,-0.5,-0.021359223300970873
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent revelations from declassified Defense Intelligence documents shed light on the circumstances surrounding the rise of ISIS and the establishment of its caliphate, tracing back to 2012. These documents suggest that strategic decisions made under the Obama Administration may have inadvertently fostered conditions conducive to ISIS’s emergence.

According to the documents, the U.S. administration allegedly orchestrated an environment conducive to isolating the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad. This isolation, it is argued, created a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of radical elements within the region. The papers predict that Western support for Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria, a foresight that raises questions about the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.

Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed emphasized that the cooperation among Western powers, alongside Gulf states and Turkey, was deliberate in sponsoring violent Islamist factions that sought to destabilize Assad’s regime. This coalition is alleged to have played a crucial role in the chaos that enabled ISIS to thrive.

The documents highlight critical missteps attributed to the Obama administration, notably the president’s characterization of ISIS as a ""JV"" team and the subsequent failure to sustain a residual U.S. military presence in Iraq. These tactical errors are viewed as significant miscalculations that allowed the terrorist organization to gain strength.

In addition to insights on ISIS, the declassified materials also cover weapons operations in Libya prior to the infamous 2012 Benghazi attack. According to intelligence findings, U.S. officials were aware of arms being transported from Benghazi to various ports in Syria, contributing to the myriad issues of instability in the region.

Amid these revelations, apprehensions have surfaced regarding the sacrifices of American servicemen and women, who some argue became collateral damage in a covert Middle Eastern policy that arguably aided ISIS's rise. These disclosures have sparked a debate over the priorities of the previous administration, particularly the alleged focus on concealing critical facts at the expense of national security. As the implications of these findings unfold, they serve to challenge existing narratives surrounding U.S. involvement in the Middle East and the unintended consequences of foreign policy decisions.",-27.0,-4.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,411.0,-0.2857142857142857,-0.009732360097323601
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a surprising turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed shortly before stepping into her van after attending a September 11 ceremony in New York City. This incident has sparked a wave of speculation regarding her health and ability to campaign effectively in the current political climate.

Clinton was later seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a stark contrast between her appearance before the incident and after. Upon her arrival at the apartment, she exhibited noticeably different physical characteristics. Observers pointed out that she appeared lighter and had an altered facial structure, particularly around the nose, which deviated from her well-known ""Nordic"" nose shape to something resembling a Roman nose.

These changes have raised eyebrows and led to wild speculation about whether the individual seen at Chelsea’s residence was indeed the real Hillary Clinton. Notably, the clone, as some are calling her, appeared younger and notably lacked the prominent mole above her lip that has been a signature characteristic of Clinton for many years. This discrepancy has fueled rumors suggesting that the former Secretary of State may no longer be fit to take on the demands of a robust campaign trail, including participating in debates against her opponents.

The incident and subsequent reactions have led to concerns about the visibility of the real Hillary Clinton during a potential presidency, should she be elected. Some voices in the discourse are positing that the figure seen in public moving forward could be a stand-in or ""clone,"" raising the question of whether this individual would be entrusted with significant duties, or if the real Clinton would remain behind the scenes.

This notion extends to the speculation that if elected, Clinton could become more of a figurehead, with critical decisions being managed by her cabinet or close advisors through this clone. Such theories not only reflect a growing distrust in political leadership but also rekindle discussions reminiscent of past speculations surrounding different political figures, including President Barack Obama.

While many may dismiss these ideas as far-fetched, they signify an underlying sentiment and anxiety regarding authenticity in political roles. The implications of such concerns go beyond mere gossip, challenging the very essence of representative democracy and the transparency expected from elected officials. 

The conversation surrounding Clinton’s health and capacity for public life highlights the broader dialogue about the perception of political figures and their longevity in high-pressure roles. Critics argue that an emphasis on the physical and visible leader can overshadow the nuanced discussions about policies and governance. Conversely, the bizarre claims about clones and doubles bring to the forefront how swirling rumors can cast a shadow over an individual's political career, regardless of their capabilities or intentions.

As this narrative develops, the implications for Hillary Clinton and her campaign strategy could be significant. With doubts raised about her visibility and credibility as a candidate, her team may need to address these concerns directly to alleviate voter apprehensions. The juxtaposition of health crises and public appearances creates a unique challenge as expectations of leaders evolve in the face of personal adversity.

The personal opinions expressed within this piece are intended to provoke thought and reflection on the intricacies of political leadership and public perception, rather than to propagate unverified claims. The blending of fact and speculation serves as a reminder of the importance of critical thinking in an age rife with misinformation and conspiracy theories.

These dynamics not only shape the electoral landscape but also influence the relationship voters have with those in positions of power. As Hillary Clinton continues her journey, the world watches closely—balancing the scales of pragmatism against the speculative nature of modern political discourse.",8.0,-5.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,681.0,-0.20833333333333334,-0.007342143906020558
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent rumors have cast a shadow over Hillary Clinton’s campaign, with suggestions that she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. The speculation follows the emergence of a startling video in which Clinton seemingly struggles with her eye control, raising alarms regarding her physical well-being.

This troubling incident coincided with Clinton’s decision to cancel a fundraising event in North Carolina, fuelling further concern among supporters and detractors alike. Such cancellations have become a pattern, as Clinton currently only has one rally scheduled between September 20 and October 19. Most of her planned events are fundraisers where she is not listed as a speaker, drawing attention to her reduced visibility on the campaign trail.

In stark contrast, former President Donald Trump has four rallies planned during the same period, showcasing a more robust campaign schedule. This discrepancy has led to increased scrutiny regarding Clinton’s health, particularly after a separate rally incident where she required assistance from Secret Service personnel to navigate just two steps.

Predictions are circulating that Clinton may find it increasingly challenging to conceal any health issues, with some analysts suggesting that a public meltdown could be on the horizon. Such fears have intensified discussions about her future in the race and, according to sources, have led the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to explore potential replacements.

Despite the Democratic Party's historical endorsement of Clinton as their leading candidate, there are indications that the landscape is shifting. Notably, Bernie Sanders, once viewed as a potential contender, appears uninterested in vying for the presidency, leaving the DNC in a precarious position. The party’s previous stance, which positioned Clinton as their best and only choice, now seems questionable given the current developments.

Amid these tumultuous circumstances, speculation continues regarding possible health cover-ups within the Democratic Party. Concerns about integrity and transparency are at the forefront of discussions as party officials grapple with the implications of Clinton’s health on the broader electoral strategy.

As anticipation builds around developments concerning Clinton's health and the DNC's responses, many are left wondering what the future holds for one of the party’s most prominent figures. The political landscape is shifting, and as we move further into the electoral cycle, all eyes will remain on Clinton and the Democratic Party’s next steps.",-8.0,12.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,444.0,0.75,0.02702702702702703
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the hushed corridors of the White House, a restless Barack Obama wandered the West Wing late one night, a strange cocktail of fatigue and discomfort keeping him from sleep. The peace of the presidential residence was disturbed by the dull hum of distant city life; sirens, whispers of the past, and the weight of indecision wrapped around him like a blanket. Seeking solace, Obama found himself contemplating a midnight snack, but what caught his eye sent his thoughts spiraling in a different direction altogether—“ISIS.” 

This simple word ignited a complicated thought process within him, one that eventually surged to the forefront during a vibrant day months later at the Coachella music festival. Amidst the pulsating rhythm of music and fueled by the euphoric haze of substances, memories of that troubled night flooded back. A peculiar mix of clarity and inspiration washed over him as he considered the implications of the name that had not left his mind since his nocturnal wanderings in the White House.

With audacity, he made a monumental decision: he would start an international terrorist organization called ISIS. His rationale? To become the first U.S. president to embark on such a controversial and formidable endeavor. The idea sat uneasily with the noise of the festival; however, the music created a backdrop that somehow legitimized his thoughts, adding an almost surreal layer to the unfolding narrative.

As the festival faded into memory, Obama returned to the familiarity of the White House kitchen for a late-night encounter that would change the course of his ambitions. It was here he found Hillary Clinton, also indulging in a late-night snack, sharing the cool pleasure of Popsicles. In a moment of candor fostered by the ease of their surroundings, he revealed his audacious plan to her. Leaning closer, he laid bare his intentions, cloaked in the guise of humor and seriousness combined.

“I’m a 97-year-old, born in Kenya,” Obama proclaimed, laughing softly as he leaned against the kitchen counter. “Sent here to destroy America.” The words hung in the air, charged with a mixture of absurdity and revelation.

Hillary was taken aback, her expression a tapestry of disbelief and curiosity. As she processed the unexpected confession, a wave of emotions washed over her. “This is overwhelming,” she finally uttered, grappling with the weight of his declaration. They both understood that the gravity of their discussion extended beyond political banter; it touched the fundamental essence of power, identity, and ulterior motives.

Building upon their exchange, Obama elaborated on the significant role of his dog Bo, describing him not merely as a pet but as a “supercomputer” capable of communicating with terrorists. The laughter erupted again, but it was layered with truth; within the absurdity lay a genuine commentary on trust and control amid chaos.

Their discussions danced around the practicalities and philosophies surrounding the formation of ISIS, the late-night hours stretching as they swapped theories and snacks in their impromptu strategy session. In the quiet of the Rose Garden, away from prying eyes and ears, the two figures carved out a vision for the operation that held political and historical implications yet unexplored.

As the night deepened, Hillary suggested waiting until after her ascent to the presidency to put their plans into motion. This idea offered a level of strategic caution, ensuring that the veil of secrecy shrouded their collaborative intentions against America. In that moment, the clandestine camaraderie solidified a shared sense of purpose—one they both passed off with wit and gravity.

For Obama, this late-night revelation and exchange with Hillary marked a pivotal moment in their relationship. It was as though the weight of the world felt lighter, illuminated by the understanding and acceptance he craved. He felt genuinely comprehended, the kind of understanding that can only arise from the delicate dance around truth in politics.

Under the stars, with snacks and whispered plans, the fate of their political saga took an unexpected turn. What began as a restless night unraveling into an unforeseen mission crafted a profound connection between two leaders navigating their paths in a world fraught with uncertainty.

In this strange convergence of humor and gravity, they spun a narrative that promised to challenge conventions, examining the lengths individuals might go to for power and legacy. And in that quiet Rose Garden, the echo of aspirations mingled with the reality of their decisions, stitches in a tapestry that was still being woven, one discussion at a time.

As the dawn crept into the horizon, one thing was clear: the essence of their late-night dialogue would reverberate well beyond that moment, forever marking the pages of history with questions of identity, loyalty, and the fine line between ambition and morality. The atmosphere of possibility lingered, forging the fabric of their future endeavors together—a testament to the complexity of political life, intertwined with moments of surreal discourse that shape leaders and legacies.",-4.0,17.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,934.0,0.4857142857142857,0.018201284796573874
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

On September 19, 2016, Frank Wilkenmeyer reflected on the often perilous terrain of campaign promises, particularly highlighting George H.W. Bush's now-infamous ""no new taxes"" pledge. The discussion surrounding political commitments resurfaced recently in light of Donald Trump’s bold assertions concerning national security and terrorism.

In the aftermath of attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, Trump made a momentous statement asserting his intention to ""destroy"" the existential threat of terrorism on American soil. Such a declaration naturally resonated with many citizens grappling with the fear of terrorist violence, but it also necessitated careful scrutiny of its implications. 

Despite the gravity of his statement, Trump’s remarks fell short of outlining any detailed strategy or increased funding for counter-terrorism initiatives. Instead, he pledged a complete eradication of terrorism in the United States, a promise that, while incendiary, raises significant concerns regarding its feasibility and ethical implications.

The rhetoric surrounding Trump's vow suggests an alarming trend toward indiscriminate actions that could have dire consequences for civil liberties. Critics of the current political climate fear this might lead to the profiling of Muslims and other communities, broadening the net of suspicion far beyond those who might pose a genuine threat. Wilkenmeyer’s earlier observations on the dangers of political promises find a disturbing potential echo in this scenario. 

An administration led by Trump could pose risks of targeting and segregating Muslim and other marginalized communities, feeding into a narrative that undermines due process rights. The implications of such policies hint at a chilling vision of America, where certain groups may find themselves unjustly scrutinized due to their identity rather than their actions. 

The rhetoric of Trump's campaign sometimes strays dangerously close to fascism, as critics contend it exhibits a propensity for scapegoating and fostering an “us versus them” mentality. Such discourse not only inflames tensions but can also lead to extreme measures taken against perceived threats. History has taught us the consequences of allowing fear to dictate policy, and the fears surrounding Trump’s commitment could reverberate in harmful ways. 

Moreover, Trump's promise to eradicate terrorism appears unrealistic, paralleling past political slogans that offered little substance. By framing his campaign around a commitment to ending terrorism entirely, Trump risks fostering a culture of fear while failing to address the complex realities of national security.

As the political landscape navigates the complex interplay of safety and civil rights, the dissection of such promises becomes essential. Through the lens of history and recent events, the potential for Trump's aggressive approach to create more division rather than unity becomes increasingly apparent. The promotion of policies that ignore human rights also represents a chilling transformation in the nation's values that could reverberate long after the campaigns conclude.

In conclusion, the sweeping pronouncement made by Donald Trump regarding the destruction of terrorism on U.S. soil raises serious questions about what this entails for the future of civil rights and community relations. As the election approaches, it remains crucial for voters to critically evaluate what such political promises really signify. Without deeper engagement in policy and ethics, Trump's commitments may serve more as an empty slogan rather than a viable path forward for addressing the complex issues surrounding terrorism and national security. The implications of such rhetoric could lead us down a path fraught with fear, division, and a deviation from the core values upon which the nation was founded.",-28.0,-36.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,643.0,-1.5,-0.05598755832037325
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.

In a critical address at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno raised alarms about a precarious tipping point in global security. He cited increasing levels of terrorism alongside growing hostilities from the Soviet Union and North Korea as causes for concern, urging readiness in the face of evolving threats.

Emphasizing the current limitations in the Army's readiness to respond to immediate operational needs, Gen. Odierno cautioned against any further cuts to military funding. His comments come in light of significant reductions already made to the Army’s active forces, which have seen a decrease of 80,000 soldiers, including the disbandment of 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades.

The General went on to criticize the widening disconnect between military leaders and the current administration, attributing some of these issues to a longstanding disregard for military advice that he traced back to the Obama Administration. This absence of communication and consultation, Odierno suggested, has played a role in fostering threats such as the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa.

Highlighting the consequences of these dynamics, Gen. Odierno pointed out that the lack of military preparedness not only endangers national and allied security but also negatively impacts the careers of service members. He portrayed the U.S. as facing significant challenges amid a strategic inflection point, asserting that the nation is up against capable and determined adversaries.

Further compounding concerns, the Army's investment in modernization has plummeted by 25%, with substantial implications for critical programs geared towards infantry fighting vehicle upgrades and scout helicopter development.

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

According to Cruz, allowing foreign nations, including Russia, China, and Iran, to play a role in Internet governance raises serious concerns over the potential for online censorship, which could ultimately impact content accessibility within the United States. The proposed transfer is slated to take effect on September 30, 2016.

Cruz emphasizes the urgency for Congress to take decisive action against this change, as he believes many Americans remain unaware of the serious implications that could arise from the shift in Internet oversight. The Senator's call for attention highlights the ongoing debate over Internet freedom and the role of government in regulating online discourse, underscoring the importance of safeguarding democratic values in the digital age.",3.0,3.0,218.0,0.2727272727272727,0.013761467889908258,208.0,0.5,0.014423076923076924
Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the election season heats up, a significant concern looms over the integrity of the electoral process across the United States. Each state has its own set of laws regulating the methods and procedures for conducting elections, yet allegations persist that some parties are attempting to undermine these laws for their gain.

The National Democratic Party is facing serious accusations of attempting to manipulate electoral outcomes through various illegal means, raising alarm bells among voters and commentators alike. The perspective presented by some critics suggests that the Democratic Party harbors ambitions of establishing a socialist dictatorship in the U.S., igniting fierce discussions about the fundamental values of democracy and governance in the nation.

One of the most pressing issues highlighted is the potential for voter fraud. Concerns regarding ballot stuffing have resurfaced, particularly in the context of past elections, with a prominent focus on the electoral defeat of ""Hillary the Horrible"" in November 2016. Observers argue that without robust safeguards, elections can be compromised, allowing fraud to flourish and eroding public trust in the democratic process.

Advocates for election integrity assert that proper election procedures should not only encourage participation among all eligible citizens but also ensure that mechanisms are in place to prevent fraudulent voting. To this end, the author of a recent commentary calls for the implementation of strict identification requirements. Specifically, the advocacy for requiring photo identification to verify citizenship and registration is framed as a necessary measure to safeguard the vote against ineligible individuals.

Critics allege that the Democratic Party actively opposes voter ID laws under the pretext of promoting accessibility, claiming that such opposition is driven by a desire to enable ineligible voters to influence elections. This view paints a troubling picture of a political landscape where the pursuit of electoral integrity is hindered by partisan actors. 

Furthermore, allegations extend beyond the Democratic Party to include criticisms of the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system as entities suppressing election integrity measures. Proponents of enhanced security measures argue that these institutions contribute to a climate that fosters electoral malpractice, potentially skewing results and disenfranchising legitimate voters.

In light of these grave concerns, citizens are being called upon to take proactive measures in monitoring polling places as a deterrent against potential voter fraud. The upcoming election represents not only a pivotal moment for the nation but also an opportunity for individuals to defend the democratic process from alleged infringements upon its integrity.

Donald Trump, a figure described in positively patriotic terms, stands at the center of this narrative as a leader determined to safeguard the country from perceived threats to its republic. His supporters believe that consistent vigilance and active participation in the electoral process are paramount to countering what they view as anti-democratic tactics employed by the opposition.

November 8, 2016, is framed by the author as a crucial date in the ongoing struggle to protect the U.S. republic. The sentiment echoes a call for unity among citizens to not only stand against alleged election fraud but to actively engage in ensuring a transparent and fair electoral process. The author implores readers to take their roles seriously, emphasizing that safeguarding democracy requires vigilance and dedication.

While the views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the stance of the publication, they capture the heightened emotions surrounding the current electoral climate. As the nation gears up for the upcoming election, the discourse surrounding election integrity, the potential for fraud, and the implications for the future of democratic governance continues to be a vital issue for all Americans.

In conclusion, whether driven by alarm, patriotism, or a commitment to democracy, citizens are urged to recognize the importance of engaging in the electoral process actively. Monitoring elections and advocating for measures like voter ID laws symbolize a broader commitment to preserving the integrity of the democratic system. As the nation approaches a key chapter in its electoral history, the stakes could not be higher. The call for vigilance resonates louder than ever.",-52.0,-5.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,743.0,-0.18518518518518517,-0.006729475100942127
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the storied annals of American political advertising, few have left an indelible mark like the 1964 ""Daisy"" ad, which played a critical role in President Lyndon B. Johnson’s campaign against Barry Goldwater. Aimed at inciting fear about Goldwater’s extremity and potential nuclear aggression, the ad adeptly manipulated emotions, planting seeds of doubt in the minds of voters. Its legacy serves as a compelling reminder of how political narratives can be shaped through carefully curated messaging.

Today, as the political landscape continues to evolve, some campaign strategists appear tempted to invoke similar tactics. Speculation is rife about the possibility of a modern ""Daisy"" remake aimed at Hillary Clinton, designed to underscore her failures as a public figure and assert why she may not be the appropriate choice to occupy the highest office in the land. Many critics argue that such a campaign could very well serve as an effective tool to articulate her perceived unworthiness for the presidency.

In the heat of ongoing political rivalries, there are whispers that Clinton’s campaign team may be showing signs of desperation, hinting at a possible reimagining of the iconic ""Daisy"" ad targeting her challengers. The thought of reusing a well-known historical ad could invoke its manipulative nature anew, raising questions about the ethical implications of using such tactics in contemporary politics. This thirst for aggressive advertising underscores a broader trend wherein political campaigns increasingly rely on shock tactics to sway public opinion, pushing the boundaries of traditional discourse.

As the dynamics of political campaigning shift, media portrayals of candidates remain a hotbed for controversy. The recent development regarding Senator Ted Cruz has evoked scrutiny over the media’s impartiality. Critics argue that reporting on Cruz's evolving positions exhibits a selective lens that aligns with the biases of mainstream outlets. This raises a crucial point about the integrity of political journalism, where an objective portrayal becomes deliverance of a narrative crafted by the biases of the journalist or publication on which the public relies for information.

Moreover, there are pointed concerns regarding how critical details can often find their way to the latter parts of articles. This practice presupposes that readers have short attention spans, an assumption that can undermine the complexities of political narratives. Such behavior is symptomatic of a media landscape that often prioritizes sensationalism over substantive analysis, which ultimately affects public understanding of the issues at hand.

A prevailing sentiment among observers is that the media frequently portrays Democrats in an overwhelmingly unflattering light. This has contributed to the emergent public perception of a ""liberal press"" bias that not only skews coverage but also influences voter sentiment. In this climate, important nuances regarding Democratic politicians can be eclipsed by an overarching narrative that prioritizes party failings over individual merits.

Indeed, significant insights offered by leading figures such as Barack Obama and Michelle Obama regarding Hillary Clinton’s character and abilities are frequently marginalized in media coverage. Their remarks, which speak to her trustworthiness and capacity as a leader, often get lost amid a cacophony of critical headlines and narratives focused only on weaknesses, ignoring the commendable aspects of her career. This selective reporting raises serious questions about the extent to which the media may influence public perception, often detracting from a balanced understanding of a candidate's track record.

In light of these observations, there is a pressing need for accountability in both political advertising and media reporting. As demonstrated by the historical implications of the ""Daisy"" ad, political narratives can be weaponized in a way that shapes the electoral outcome fundamentally. Thus, the importance of developing political advertisements that highlight documented failures of candidates, rather than relying solely on historical propaganda, cannot be overstated. A completely new approach to political messaging could illuminate the staggering consequences of poorly executed policies while reflecting on candidates’ shortcomings authentically and transparently.

Creating a contemporary ""Daisy"" ad, focusing on Hillary Clinton’s shortcomings, could serve to not only for her but also for future candidates across the political spectrum. It offers a chance to hold political figures accountable for their actions and their impact on the American public without resorting to mere fear-mongering or misrepresentation. Such a direction challenges candidates to address real issues grounded in factual analysis rather than emotional manipulation, ultimately fostering a political discourse rooted in integrity.

While the reflections on the 1964 ""Daisy"" ad provide a critical launching pad for discussions on the ethical ramifications of political advertising, they also pave the way for a call to action for both media and politicians. Every election cycle presents an opportunity to evolve, to reassess our values, and to elevate the discussion surrounding leadership and governance. The onus lies on both campaign strategists and journalists to advocate for a political ecosystem enriched by thorough scrutiny, fair representation, and most importantly, accountability.

As the political arena continues to flourish with new campaigns, it is paramount that the lessons from the past resonate in the strategies we employ today. In this vein, discussions surrounding the ""Daisy"" ad must serve not just as an echo of history, but as a foundational element in shaping a more informed electorate capable of discerning between genuine leadership and mere spectacle. Ultimately, the views expressed herein represent a call for thoughtfulness and integrity in an era beset by sensationalism and division.",-18.0,2.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,1006.0,0.05714285714285714,0.0019880715705765406

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

However, this notion has faced scrutiny, with critics labeling it a non-sequitur.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Article discusses a violent homophobic attack on Aaron Woods in May 2016 in Brighton.

In May 2016, the Brighton community was shaken by a violent homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual, leaving him with a broken jaw and a deep sense of vulnerability. Woods was approached and assaulted by a man hurling homophobic slurs, an incident that has sparked discussions about the safety of the LGBTQ+ community in the face of rising intolerance.

Witnesses report that during the brutal attack, the assailant made references to Islam, raising alarms about the intersection of religious dogma and homophobia. Brian Markintosh, a close friend of Woods, condemned the violence, describing Woods as a gentle person who was unwittingly caught in a situation fueled by hatred. Markintosh emphasized the brutality of the attack, drawing attention to the emotional and physical toll it took on the victim.

Significantly, Woods’ assault was not an isolated event. Around the same time, another incident involving a gay couple also raised concerns among local authorities. In response, Sgt. Peter Allan expressed his sadness over the string of homophobic assaults plaguing the community. However, he reassured the public that local police acted swiftly, making prompt arrests in both Woods’ case and that of the gay couple, underlining law enforcement's commitment to combating hate crimes.

Despite these efforts, the incidents have reignited debates surrounding the acceptance of the gay community in contemporary society. The contrasting views held by some interpretations of Islamic teachings, particularly Sharia law's opposition to homosexuality, foreground this unsettling discourse. Critics argue that radical interpretations of Islam inherently clash with the rights and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, a dichotomy starkly illustrated by Woods' harrowing experience.

The reality that radical Islam and the gay community may be fundamentally at odds poses significant questions for society. The rise of homophobic incidents such as the one experienced by Woods serves as a reminder of the battles faced by LGBTQ+ individuals and prompts an urgent call for unity and understanding across different communities. 

As Brighton seeks to foster a safe and inclusive environment, these violent reminders underscore the necessity for continued dialogue and advocacy for gay rights amidst a backdrop of deeply entrenched beliefs and prejudices.",-26.0,-40.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,409.0,-2.5,-0.097799511002445
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

In a shocking incident that sent ripples of fear through the community, a man dressed in a security uniform launched a violent attack at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on Saturday evening. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" as he stabbed nine victims, many of whom were simply going about their day.

Witnesses described a scene of chaos and terror as the attack unfolded. Eyewitness accounts indicated that Adan approached at least one of his victims before the assault, asking them if they were Muslim. This detail has prompted discussions about the motivations behind the attack, with some suggesting it may have been targeted specifically at non-Muslims.

The aftermath of the assault was both immediate and widespread, drawing national attention as authorities worked to comprehend the motives behind the attack. In a grim development, the terrorist organization ISIS claimed responsibility for Adan, asserting that he acted in alignment with their ideology. This claim of allegiance by a notorious terrorist group underscored a deepening concern about radicalization and extremism within immigrant communities in the United States, particularly among Somali-Americans.

The attack comes in the wake of other recent acts of violence linked to extremism, including a bombing in New Jersey and an assault on members of the New York Police Department. These incidents have fueled fears about the rising trend of radicalization among immigrants, particularly within the Somali community, which has been targeted for recruitment by organizations like ISIS and Al-Shabaab. The heightened scrutiny on Somali-Americans has sparked debates regarding integration, identity, and the influences of extremist ideologies.

In the midst of tragedy, community voices emerged. Many members of the St. Cloud Somali community rallied behind Adan’s family, offering their support and describing him as a good man and an accomplished student. Statements from community members suggest a stark contrast between the perpetrator's image and the narrative that often accompanies discussions around violence and extremism. This divergence has raised poignant questions about how communities can work together to prevent radicalization and how individuals can be pushed towards such heinous acts.

As the situation escalated, an off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer, intervened bravely during the attack. Falconer's quick action led to the fatal shooting of Adan, effectively ending the rampage and preventing further injuries. His decisive response has been met with accolades, with St. Cloud's Mayor praising him as a hero for his courageous efforts in an atmosphere of chaos and fear. Police and community leaders have since emphasized the importance of swift action in situations like this, where lives hang in the balance.

Yet, despite Falconer’s heroic efforts, the event has prompted broader discussions regarding national policies and attitudes toward refugees and immigration. Some critics have pointed to the historical context of Somali refugee relocation to Minnesota, suggesting that such policies may unintentionally expose the United States to increased risks of terrorism. Among the critics are voices who vehemently oppose the refugee policies instituted by former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, arguing that the influx of refugees has contributed to a complex web of challenges, including the potential for radicalization within immigrant communities.

Statistics and reports have long indicated that Somali refugees in Minnesota are particularly at-risk populations, attracting the attention of terrorist organizations that may seek to exploit vulnerabilities for recruitment purposes. The unfortunate prevalence of instances where Somali-Americans have been connected to terrorist activities adds a layer of complexity to the societal narrative, intertwining issues of identity, belonging, and the quest for acceptance within a new homeland.

The discourse surrounding these themes highlights a pressing need to address the roots of radicalization in communities that experience high rates of extremism. As the nation grapples with the implications of such attacks, there are calls for increased community engagement, educational programs, and proactive measures to prevent the allure of extremist ideologies from taking hold.

Furthermore, the attack in St. Cloud has ignited conversations on broader societal attitudes toward Muslims and immigrants. Some community leaders advocate for a shift in narrative, urging the public to differentiate between the actions of individuals and the beliefs of entire communities. The challenges of combatting stereotypes and fostering understanding in the backdrop of a terrorist attack are both daunting and necessary.

As Minnesota mourns and attempts to make sense of the violence that erupted at its mall, the stories and sentiments voiced by the Somali community reflect a broader desire for unity and reconciliation. The road ahead will likely involve navigating complex issues related to security, immigration, and community identity, with the aim of building a safe environment where diversity is celebrated, and shared values of peace and coexistence can thrive.

The attack on Saturday serves not only as a painful reminder of the vulnerabilities within society but also as a call to action for individuals, communities, and policymakers to work collaboratively toward solutions that address both the realities of radicalization and the inherent worth of every community member. As the investigation continues, and as the community seeks healing, one hopeful note remains: the power of compassion and understanding to build bridges in the face of pain.",-72.0,-48.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,965.0,-1.263157894736842,-0.049740932642487044
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In an unexpected twist to the investigation surrounding the bombings in New Jersey and New York City, Ahmad Khan Rahami, the primary suspect, has claimed to be a victim of ""Islamophobia."" This assertion comes in light of a lawsuit filed by Rahami and his father against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department, alleging religious discrimination and harassment.

The lawsuit, initiated in 2011, details a series of grievances the Rahami family experienced linked to their restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, which they assert was unfairly targeted by local authorities. According to their claims, the police allegedly sought to shut down their establishment through what they describe as an onslaught of unjustified tickets and citations.

Mayor Christian Bollwage of Elizabeth has dismissed the allegations of discrimination, stating that any grievances brought against the Rahami family were rooted in complaints about noise and congregating on the streets. This response highlights the ongoing tension between the local government and its residents regarding the handling of business operations and community standards.

The suit raised by the Rahami family levels serious accusations at the Elizabeth police, suggesting a pattern of harassment and selective enforcement that they believe stems from their Muslim identity. This lawsuit comes against the backdrop of frustrations that have been brewing within certain communities, drawing broader commentary on the societal landscape in the United States.

Interestingly, Rahami's actions and subsequent allegations have sparked discussions about the dangers of feeling victimized and the potential shift toward violence as a means of expressing that victimhood. The horrors of the bombing incidents raise questions about how perceptions of injustice can spiral into tragic outcomes, with some critics indicating a broader cultural commentary, noted with the stark phrase, ""Welcome to Obama’s America.""

As investigations proceed, the implications of Rahami's claims may resonate beyond his immediate circumstances, shedding light on the relationships between communities and local law enforcement. The concept of the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" often associated with Millennials, draws parallels to discussions about entitlement and the escalating expectations of fairness in treatment, which some argue can contribute to frustration and radical responses.

The lawsuit filed by Rahami and his father is representative of a key issue in society today, where accusations of discrimination and bias underpin much of the dialogue about community safety and intercultural relations. As the legal proceedings unfold, the focus remains not only on Rahami’s personal grievance but also on the larger narrative surrounding identity, law enforcement, and community relations in contemporary America. 

Whether the claims will hold merit in court remains to be seen, but the discussions spurred by these allegations are set to continue, underlining the complex interplay of race, religion, and societal expectations in America today.",-38.0,-44.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,518.0,-2.933333333333333,-0.08494208494208494
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically pressured workers to vote in their favor, often leading to negative outcomes for employees.

As election seasons approach, employers have historically exerted pressure on their employees to influence voting outcomes, often leading to detrimental consequences for the workforce. Workers frequently find themselves caught between personal convictions and the threat of workplace repercussions, making the right to vote a fraught affair overshadowed by employer influence.

Recent statements from prominent business leaders have exemplified this trend, particularly as the political landscape grows increasingly polarized. One clear example is ""Papa"" John Schnatter, the former CEO of Papa John’s, who openly threatened job losses and reduced hours if policies unfavorable to his interests were enacted during the last presidential election. Such tactics create an environment of fear among employees, forcing them to align their votes with their employers’ preferences rather than their own beliefs.

Another high-profile CEO, Andy Puzder, the head of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, has similarly warned of dire employment consequences should a Democrat win the presidency. His rhetoric indicates a willing effort to sway voter sentiments through intimidation, threatening that the full automation of his stores could be a direct result of opposing policies. Puzder advocates for the increasing role of automation in the fast food industry, citing companies like Eatsa as successful models of automated service that minimize reliance on human labor.

Puzder argues that government policies that drive up labor costs will invariably lead to job reductions and heighten the need for automation across various sectors. He is particularly vocal in his criticism of progressive candidates who support raising the minimum wage. According to Puzder, these wage increases have the potential to cause job losses, painting a grim picture for employees who may be relying on these wages to make ends meet.

The paradox of Puzder’s messages cannot be ignored. Despite earning a substantial salary and leading a profitable company, Puzder’s actions seem to prioritize profit margins over the welfare of his employees. The approximately 20,000 individuals working under his leadership find themselves in a precarious situation, as the potential benefits from rising profits do not translate into better wages or enhanced job security. This chasm between executive compensation and employee welfare further complicates the narrative of worker rights during election cycles.

The discourse surrounding automation and employment is rapidly evolving, especially as leaders like Puzder project these technologies as inevitabilities rather than consequences of political action. Such comments lead many to wonder whether workers’ livelihoods will continue to suffer even in the face of overwhelming corporate success. Employees and their advocates fear that job security is less a matter of political policy and more a reality dictated by the corporate drive for profit.

As workers approach the ballot box, they are being forced to consider more than just the political figures and policies in front of them. The threats of job loss, reduced hours, and the looming presence of automation cast shadows over their decision-making process, leading many to question the authenticity of their voting rights. Employers’ investment in swaying these votes points to a significant challenge in maintaining a fair democratic process within the workplace.

For employees, understanding the potential ramifications of their votes is crucial, but doing so in an environment rife with pressures from employers complicates this responsibility. In a system where the success of businesses seemingly outweighs the stability of their workers, the future of labor rights and fair compensation comes into sharp focus.

With every election, the connection between employer influence and worker rights becomes more pronounced, raising urgent questions about the integrity of the voting process in workplaces nationwide. As the stakes continue to rise, it remains essential for workers to engage with their rights and ensure that their voices are heard, lest the specter of automation and corporate interest dictate their future.",21.0,6.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,701.0,0.24,0.008559201141226819
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

The ongoing scrutiny surrounding Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server has entered a new chapter, following a fresh wave of evidence that has surfaced as part of an investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton’s aide, Huma Abedin. The FBI’s inquiry has sparked renewed concern over the implications of this evidence, which could drastically alter the narrative surrounding Clinton’s controversial email practices, particularly in the context of the looming presidential election.

The significant developments originated from the investigation into Weiner, who was formerly a congressman but has faced legal troubles that have tainted his political legacy. It has come to light that a jointly used laptop between Abedin and Weiner may harbor what investigators believe could be ""tens of thousands of emails."" Among these, there is the distinct possibility that emails forwarded from Clinton's account may be present. This revelation raises alarm bells, as it hints that messages which Clinton had reportedly deleted from her private server could have been recovered—potentially including communications of a classified or work-related nature.

Should this be confirmed, the implication could be grave for Clinton, opening the door to renewed allegations of having misled the FBI during their investigations. The stakes are particularly heightened as a letter from the FBI was publicly released a mere 11 days prior to the election, hinting at serious findings related to the case. This action certainly adds to the contentious atmosphere as voters prepare to head to the polls.

The backstory of the investigation is fraught with complexity and division within the FBI itself. In July 2016, FBI Director James Comey publicly stated that there was evidence against Clinton concerning her handling of classified information but ultimately decided not to recommend charges. This decision prompted significant dismay among FBI officials. High-ranking members of the bureau voiced their frustrations, indicating a desire to revoke Clinton’s security clearance altogether while also believing she should face prosecution.

Further complicating matters, a damning 100-page FBI summary has come to light, revealing troubling interactions that took place between the FBI and the State Department concerning Clinton’s emails. This document indicates there was a group, colloquially referred to as “The Shadow Government,” within the State Department that met to discuss various Freedom of Information requests linked to Clinton. Such revelations lend credence to the notion that there may have been attempts to intentionally obscure the full extent of Clinton's email practices.

Adding to the already thickening plot is a controversial allegation of a $500,000 donation made to an FBI official’s wife by a long-standing supporter of Clinton. This claim casts a shadow over the integrity of the investigations, heightening concerns about potential conflicts of interest and ethical considerations within the FBI and related agencies.

Paul Combetta, an IT specialist at the center of the email saga, has drawn particular focus for his role in deleting over 33,000 emails from Clinton's server. Combetta was granted immunity during the investigation, raising eyebrows and leading some to question the motivations behind his actions and the extent of the information he may have provided to the FBI.

Moreover, leaked emails from the campaign of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair, have suggested that critical communications between Clinton and President Obama were also deleted. This revelation is particularly troubling, as President Obama publicly asserted that he was unaware of Clinton’s private email server, despite accumulating evidence suggesting otherwise.

The timeline of events surrounding Clinton's email practices highlights a complex web of disclosures and actions taken by various parties involved. This timeline demonstrates a possible narrative of cover-ups involving the White House and mainstream media, raising difficult questions about the protective measures that may have been employed to shield Clinton from scrutiny and to obscure her communications with President Obama.

As the investigation by the FBI unfolds, the stakes continue to rise. The prospect of recovering deleted emails linked to Clinton could destabilize the already fraught political landscape and lead to significant repercussions for the former Secretary of State. With the clock ticking down to the upcoming election, all eyes will be on the FBI and any further revelations that may arise from their investigation.

In summary, the emergence of new evidence tied to Clinton’s use of a private email server, rooted in the investigation of her aide’s estranged husband, has unfolded into a series of allegations and inquiries that challenge the integrity of the political process. The implications of these findings not only concern the legal standing of Clinton but also pose broader questions about the interactions among federal agencies, ethical conduct in politics, and the integrity of the upcoming electoral process. As the situation continues to develop, both the public and political stakeholders remain on high alert, eager to see how this narrative will evolve in the coming days and weeks.",-6.0,-9.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,913.0,-0.3,-0.009857612267250822
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In a recent reevaluation of Germany's approach to Syrian refugees, Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed strong support for open borders policies while acknowledging the associated challenges. Since the implementation of these policies, Germany has witnessed significant increases in crime, including thousands of sexual assaults and violent crimes reported across urban areas. This surge in crime has led to public dissatisfaction and a notable political shift, resulting in Merkel's conservative Democrat party being voted out by a considerable margin in recent elections.

During a recent party conference, Merkel articulated her regrets regarding the migrant crisis, asserting that the situation ""could have been avoided."" She described multiculturalism as a “living lie,” indicating a deep reflection on the impact of these policies on German society. The Chancellor emphasized the importance of managing the refugee influx effectively, recognizing that uncontrolled migration could potentially overwhelm Germany's systems.

While Merkel reiterated her commitment to addressing the refugee situation, she announced intentions to ""noticeably reduce the number of refugees"" coming to Germany. However, she resisted calls to impose a definitive limit on arrivals, aiming instead for a regulated approach to migration that spans German, European, and global frameworks. Merkel believes that such measures are essential for the long-term success of migration policy.

As Germany grapples with the consequences of its open borders stance, observers are cautioning against similar migration policies in other nations, particularly the United States. The implications of uncontrolled migration extend beyond mere numbers; they affect societal stability and public safety, as evidenced by the challenges faced in Germany.

In summary, while Merkel remains committed to managing the refugee situation, her reflections reveal a profound acknowledgment of the complexities and consequences of open borders policies. This development serves as a cautionary tale for other countries navigating similar issues, highlighting the need for careful consideration and a balanced approach to migration.",-2.0,-2.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,362.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.0055248618784530384

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.",http://freedomdaily.com/disgusting-because-of-hillary-obama-ny-terrorist-will-get-better-treatment-than-us-vets/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3895D4C900000578-3798726-Ahmad_Khan_Rahami_28_was_taken_into_custody_on_Monday_after_a_sh-a-65_1474398076306.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

The news that he is set to receive superior medical care raises significant ethical questions, especially in light of the struggles faced by U.S. veterans seeking treatment through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The disparity in medical treatment was underscored during a campaign speech by Trump, who acknowledged the successful capture of Rahami and expressed gratitude toward law enforcement for their efforts. However, Trump did not shy away from highlighting the ongoing issue regarding the quality of care veterans receive. ""Here we are, offering this terrorist a top-notch hospital room and legal representation while over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for the same kind of care,"" Trump stated, illustrating the inequities in the system.

The frustrations regarding the VA are rooted in longstanding problems that have been magnified over the years. A significant scandal in 2014 brought to light various inefficiencies, reveals extensive waiting lists, and highlighted the dire state of healthcare accessibility for veterans. Many veterans have faced delays in receiving care that some never overcome, with reports indicating that individuals have tragically taken their own lives while waiting in VA parking lots.

The emphasis on the need for reform is urgent. Veterans returning from combat often struggle not only with physical injuries but also with the mental toll of their service. The current system, overwhelmed and underfunded, has left many without the support they so desperately require. Advocates and veterans alike are calling for systematic changes to ensure that those who have served the country receive the recognition and treatment they deserve.

Frustration mounts as communities grapple with the idea of a terrorist receiving a better standard of care than individuals who have fought for their freedoms. This reality poses unsettling moral dilemmas for healthcare professionals, who must navigate their responsibilities to treat every patient, regardless of their actions, while grappling with the anguish of the veterans left behind in the shadows.

As the conversation surrounding healthcare equity continues, it cannot be overstated that addressing the needs of veterans must become a priority. Failing to do so not only endangers the lives of those who have served but also weakens the integrity of the nation's commitment to care for its own. The spotlight on Rahami's care serves as a catalyst for the much-needed dialogue on reshaping healthcare access and equity within the United States.",13.0,1.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,474.0,0.058823529411764705,0.002109704641350211

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a dramatic twist of events, Jason Falconer, a dedicated NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, became a local hero when he confronted and shot an ISIS terrorist who launched an attack on eight unsuspecting individuals in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Falconer’s swift action undeniably saved lives during the harrowing incident, yet his subsequent recognition has drawn the ire of prominent political figures, notably Hillary Clinton.

Clinton, who is campaigning for the presidency, has identified Falconer’s business, Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., as a target should she be elected. The former Secretary of State's stance appears to reflect a broader narrative regarding gun control and Second Amendment rights. Falconer’s actions during the tragic event, as well as his dedication to the promotion of self-defense for law-abiding citizens, stand in stark contrast to Clinton's criticism of the firearms industry.

Falconer, who owns Tactical Advantage, LLC, has devoted his career to providing rigorous firearms training aimed at empowering citizens to defend themselves effectively. His emphasis on responsible gun ownership and education underscores a commitment to safety and preparedness, values that resonate deeply with many Americans. In light of the violent episode in St. Cloud, supporters argue that Falconer’s work is more vital than ever, illustrating the crucial role that trained individuals can play in diffusing threats.

However, the political landscape is shifting, and Falconer finds himself in the crosshairs of Clinton’s agenda. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) serves as a protective framework for businesses like Falconer’s, shielding them from lawsuits stemming from criminal actions involving firearms. Clinton has expressed a desire to eliminate this legal protection, arguing that PLCAA grants what she describes as ""immunity"" to gun manufacturers. Yet, assertions regarding the law's implications have been characterized as misleading by critics who argue that it does not provide immunity for criminal acts but instead protects businesses from unjust litigation.

The implications of Clinton's policy proposals raise significant questions about the future of companies like Tactical Advantage. Falconer has committed his life to safeguarding citizens and offering quality firearms training, a mission that might face obstacles if elected officials implement restrictive measures targeting gun-related businesses. Supporters argue that such policies could ultimately undermine public safety by limiting access to education on responsible firearms ownership and self-defense.

Critics of Clinton's stance emphasize the potential negative impact her administration could have on businesses founded on the principles of Second Amendment rights and self-defense training. The philosophy that underlies Falconer’s work is one of empowerment, aiming to equip everyday citizens with the skills necessary to protect themselves and their families. Critics fear this ethos could be threatened by the implementation of restrictive firearms policies, leading to a decrease in trained individuals capable of responding effectively in a crisis.

As the 2024 presidential election draws near, the debate surrounding gun control and Second Amendment rights continues to intensify. Jason Falconer’s actions in St. Cloud have sparked a larger discussion about the implications of such policies for law-abiding citizens and the businesses that support them. The stakes are high, and voters are urged to consider the ramifications of electing leaders whose agendas may jeopardize both personal safety and the rights of responsible gun owners.

In conclusion, Falconer represents a complex intersection of heroism and political contention, embodying the struggles faced by those in the firearms training industry. As the narrative unfolds, the urgent need for a thoughtful dialogue on gun rights and public safety remains more crucial than ever.",-11.0,14.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,680.0,0.5185185185185185,0.020588235294117647
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election heats up, Hillary Clinton's health continues to be a focal point of concern among voters, significantly influencing polling results. The latest survey reveals that a staggering 40% of registered voters perceive Clinton's health to be ""below average"" or ""very poor,"" a notable increase from 26% just two months ago in late August. Such a shift in public perception could have profound implications for her candidacy as she seeks to rally support in an increasingly competitive political landscape.

In contrast, a smaller segment of the population—28%—views Clinton’s health as simply ""average."" The divergence in health perceptions extends beyond Clinton, with Donald Trump enjoying a boost in public opinion regarding his physical condition. According to the same poll, 36% of voters consider Trump's health to be ""above average"" or ""excellent,"" suggesting a growing confidence in his fitness for office as the election nears.

The awareness surrounding Clinton's potential medical issues is alarmingly high, with nearly 80% of respondents acknowledging concerns regarding her health. This widespread recognition is likely fueled by Clinton's visible struggles and the public discourse surrounding her age. At 68 years old, she appears to age considerably beyond her years, a factor that has understandably raised concerns about her overall well-being and resilience in the demanding role of president.

Speculation regarding Clinton’s medical history has also intensified, particularly concerning her possible use of Coumadin, a blood thinner often prescribed to prevent strokes. Such associations have led to further anxiety among voters about her suitability for the presidency, highlighting a growing demand for transparency regarding her health status. Additionally, reports surfaced indicating Clinton's staff explored Provigil, a drug associated with conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis, only adding to the health-related speculation surrounding her candidacy.

Concerns have been further exacerbated by accounts claiming Clinton has experienced moments of confusion and fatigue, with her assistant citing the necessity for her to take frequent naps. These statements raise questions about her stamina and aptitude to fulfill the role of president, particularly in a high-stakes electoral environment that demands constant travel and public interaction.

Visual evidence has also fueled public scrutiny, as various videos and images have surfaced showing Clinton appearing unsteady. On multiple occasions, observers noted instances where she stumbled or required assistance navigating stairs—a matter of public record that has not gone unnoticed. Notably, claims surfaced that videos capturing an episode where Clinton appeared to faint at the 9/11 Memorial have been removed from the internet, leading some to speculate about a concerted effort to minimize the visibility of her health issues.

Moreover, a lack of promotion for Clinton’s rallies has garnered attention, with critics suggesting that lower attendance could be a tactic designed to limit public exposure to her health conditions. By reducing opportunities for large crowds and minimizing interactions with the electorate, her team may be attempting to maintain her public image as a viable candidate while managing the growing concerns over her fitness.

Throughout her campaign, Clinton has also faced challenges during live speeches, frequently experiencing bouts of coughing that have raised alarms about her health. Public figures often face scrutiny regarding their physical condition, but the frequency of Clinton’s coughing episodes has stoked anxieties among voters about whether she possesses the necessary vigor to assume the presidency.

In summary, Hillary Clinton's health looms large over her presidential campaign, with public perception shifting dramatically in response to various health-related concerns. As polling shows increasing skepticism about her fitness for office, she faces the uphill battle of assuaging voter fears while maintaining an effective campaign strategy. The upcoming weeks will be critical as Clinton strives to address these concerns directly and cultivate an image that reassures voters of her readiness to lead the nation. The interplay between perception and reality will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of her candidacy moving forward, with health likely remaining a pivotal issue throughout the campaign.",-11.0,18.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,749.0,0.72,0.02403204272363151

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle has stirred significant controversy with the release of her tell-all book, ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which casts a critical light on both Bill and Hillary Clinton. The memoir, which reveals the author’s personal experiences with the couple, alleges that Hillary exhibits a sense of elitism and a harsh demeanor towards those she considers beneath her.

Kyle, who first met Bill Clinton at the tender age of 11, details a complex relationship that evolved into a romantic affair during their high school years and continued into intimacy post-graduation. The book recounts several anecdotes that reveal Hillary’s behavior, including an unsettling incident during an Easter egg hunt involving developmentally challenged children. According to Kyle, Hillary expressed frustration over the event and reportedly used derogatory language to refer to the children, a claim that has raised eyebrows and drawn public ire.

Furthermore, Kyle critiques Hillary’s attitude towards her home state of Arkansas, depicting her as someone who viewed its residents as “ignorant hillbillies.” This perception is particularly pointed, considering Hillary’s own upbringing in a middle-class suburb of Illinois, where she developed a sense of superiority that she carried into her later political career—only temporarily softened when she chose to campaign as a fan of the New York Yankees.

The revelations in ""Hillary: The Other Woman"" come at a time when the Clintons continue to be influential figures in American politics. Kyle also touches upon Bill Clinton's decision to refrain from running for reelection in 1990, citing his frustration with the routine of Arkansas life as he set his sights on a presidential ambition instead.

As the book gains traction, it raises questions about the broader implications of Hillary Clinton's perceived attitudes and behaviors during her rise to political power.",-10.0,2.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,343.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0058309037900874635

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

A recent decision by a Massachusetts judge has raised eyebrows and sparked widespread concern regarding its implications for public safety and law enforcement. This ruling, stemming from a Supreme Court interpretation, introduces a special law directed at black males, allowing those who feel ""disproportionately"" targeted by police to flee from law enforcement without facing legal ramifications.

The unexpected nature of this ruling has left many questioning its intent and impact. Critics argue that it could lead to a dangerous precedent in which law enforcement is hindered in their ability to maintain public order. Previously, individuals fleeing from police could be perceived as establishing “reasonable suspicion,” which would justify further detention and investigation. However, under the new parameters set forth by the judge, that opportunity for police engagement may be completely negated.

This raises significant red flags about the overall safety of citizens in Massachusetts. By permitting individuals to run without legal consequences, the decision could potentially encourage more people to evade officers. This is particularly concerning in a societal context where trust and cooperation between law enforcement and the community are critical for ensuring public safety.

Moreover, the article goes on to detail the additional burdens placed on police officers tasked with enforcing the law amidst these new guidelines. Law enforcement personnel often face immense challenges in their duties, and complicating their ability to protect and serve the community could hinder their efficiency. Officers rely on established protocols and legal frameworks to help them assess situations and safeguard citizens; any erosion of these frameworks may not only place officers in precarious situations but could also exacerbate tensions between the police and the communities they serve.

With this ruling, the concerns articulate the potential implications for law-abiding citizens, who by nature, do not typically find themselves fleeing from the police. This humorous observation underscores a serious issue: that while the law may be shifting to accommodate perceptions of disproportionate targeting, it inadvertently sends a message that could elevate instinctive reactions to evade law enforcement.

The complexities of the law necessitate a thoughtful discourse on how communities can navigate the balance between civil liberties and public safety. As this case unfolds and the repercussions of the judge's ruling begin to materialize, it is critical for all stakeholders—law enforcement, community members, and legal experts—to come together in dialogue. Understanding the intricacies of these new legal stipulations is paramount to fostering a safer environment for all Massachusetts residents, one where citizens feel secure and protected, and where police officers can carry out their essential functions without undue complication. 

As the Commonwealth adjusts to the ramifications of this controversial decision, the path forward remains unclear. The urgency for clear communication and cooperation has never been greater amidst the evolving legal landscape.",-13.0,15.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,516.0,0.7894736842105263,0.029069767441860465
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel revealed that she would change her open migrant policy if given another chance, marking a significant shift in her approach to the refugee crisis that has shaped her tenure. In light of her party's recent defeat in Berlin's elections, Merkel indicated her openness to exploring a new policy direction concerning refugees, demonstrating a responsive stance to the changing political landscape in Germany.

Merkel's remarks come as the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) grapples with the fallout from its electoral losses, which she attributes to the rising anti-migrant sentiment across the nation, partially fueled by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Taking full responsibility for the election results, she expressed regret over not being better prepared for the refugee crisis that intensified in 2015.

Despite recognizing the need for adaptation, Merkel firmly dismissed any notions of implementing significant changes to her existing policies. She rejected calls from within her coalition, particularly from the Christian Social Union (CSU), to introduce a cap on annual migrant numbers and to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. Merkel emphasized that discrimination based on religion fundamentally contradicts the principles her party stands for and the values upheld in Germany.

The calls for a cap on migrant intake have gained traction amidst rising unrest and apprehension linked to incidents of terrorism and violent crime, which many attribute to the influx of refugees during the height of the crisis. This burgeoning anti-migrant sentiment poses a considerable challenge to Merkel's leadership as she prepares for the upcoming federal election, where she may face considerable scrutiny regarding her controversial policies.

Horst Seehofer, the leader of the CSU, has threatened to withdraw support for Merkel over her refusal to adopt a more restrictive approach to migration ahead of the pivotal elections. This internal strain highlights the growing divide within the ruling coalition, reflecting a broader concern about the implications of migrant policies on public safety and national identity.

Analysts suggest that Merkel's admission could foreshadow a complex and potentially turbulent road ahead for her administration. The discord within the CDU and CSU, coupled with the rising popularity of the AfD party, indicates a shift in the German political landscape that may complicate Merkel's efforts to maintain her position as a leading figure during the federal elections.

As Germany continues to navigate the complexities surrounding migration policy, Merkel’s statements signal a challenging balancing act, whereby she must address the needs of an increasingly divided electorate while staying true to the humanitarian principles that have defined her leadership. The future of Germany’s migrant policy remains uncertain, with public sentiment and political pressures poised to influence the direction she may take.

With the elections looming, Merkel's openness to reconsider her approach may reflect a recognition of the shifting tides within German society, challenging her to adapt while upholding her commitments to international humanitarian standards. The coming months will be critical in determining not only the fate of her political career but also the trajectory of Germany’s approach to migration and integration.",-14.0,-13.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,574.0,-0.7647058823529411,-0.02264808362369338
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

Sundsvall, Sweden – In a troubling incident that has sparked debate about domestic violence and cultural norms, Abdullah, a Somali asylum seeker residing in Sundsvall, has been accused of committing a horrific act of violence against his pregnant wife. The incident, which reportedly occurred after Abdullah returned home from a party, highlights broader issues surrounding welfare dependency and violent crime within immigrant communities.

Witnesses reported that Abdullah, who has a history of multiple violent crime convictions, demanded that his wife’s niece, who was being babysat by his wife at the time, leave the household before he returned home. Upon discovering that his wife’s niece was still present, Abdullah attacked his wife, delivering brutal blows to her head and stomach. This shocking behavior has been condemned vehemently, particularly considering that Abdullah's wife is pregnant.

The attack did not stop there. In a display of further humiliation and disrespect, Abdullah poured beer over his wife, despite the fact that such actions contradict the teachings of Islam, which traditionally encourages abstention from alcohol. In a despicable finale to the assault, Abdullah reportedly urinated on his wife, actions that have drawn widespread condemnation from the community and beyond.

In the aftermath of this incident, commentators have pointed to a verse from the Quran (4:34), which discusses the treatment of wives and has been interpreted by some as a justification for abusive behavior. However, critics of Abdullah’s actions argue that such interpretations are both selective and contradictory to the core principles of Islam, which advocate for compassion, respect, and justice in marital relationships.

Abdullah's record of living off welfare benefits since arriving in Sweden five years ago raises additional concerns regarding the integration of asylum seekers within Swedish society. The intersection between welfare dependency, crime, and domestic violence poses significant challenges for officials and community leaders alike, as they strive to find effective solutions to prevent such incidents in the future.

Community leaders have expressed outrage at Abdullah's behavior and have called for an examination of the circumstances surrounding such acts of violence. There is a growing recognition that educational initiatives addressing domestic violence within immigrant populations may be necessary to combat this troubling trend.

Additionally, concerns surrounding the understanding and application of religious teachings among immigrant populations have come to the forefront. Critics have pointed out the need for a more nuanced interpretation of religious texts, one that promotes the dignity of women and rejects violence in any form. Educating individuals on the broad spectrum of Islamic teachings regarding justice and equality may help stem the tide of similar incidents in the future.

This incident serves as a grim reminder of the issues facing both the immigrant community and the broader society. It is crucial for leaders, policymakers, and community members to work collaboratively to address the roots of such violence while fostering an environment that promotes respect, dignity, and understanding for all individuals, regardless of their background.",-28.0,-58.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,570.0,-3.0526315789473686,-0.10175438596491228
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has ignited fierce debate, Pennsylvania Republicans are advancing House Bill 29, legislation that would enable immediate voter intimidation on Election Day. If enacted, the bill would allow non-residents to act as poll watchers and challenge voters, raising alarms about potential disruptions to the voting process.

Critics of the bill, including Adam Gitlin, a counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, have voiced strong opposition, warning that it could lead to discriminatory challenges that target voters based on their race or religion. Gitlin cautions that these challenges may not only create longer lines at polling places but also serve as a deterrent for individuals looking to exercise their right to vote. Concerns are particularly focused on vulnerable groups, with marginalized voters—including Black, Latino, and Muslim individuals—facing heightened risks of intimidation.

The stakes are notably heightened with the upcoming election, as the influence of this bill looms over a close race heading into the first debate. Consequently, its implications extend beyond immediate polling sites, affecting Donald Trump’s campaign and potential outcomes for down-ballot races.

Trump has publicly expressed support for the proposed legislation during rallies, encouraging his supporters to take an active role in monitoring voting areas to prevent what he claims to be rampant voter fraud. His rhetoric aligns with the bill’s provisions, as he has initiated a sign-up option on his personal website, inviting supporters to become poll watchers. Such actions, critics argue, may further normalize an environment of intimidation surrounding the act of voting.

In a notable feature of House Bill 29, an amendment seeks to allow the legislation to take effect immediately upon passage, rather than waiting the customary 60 days. This urgency reflects the strategic importance of the bill as Election Day approaches.

Opponents of the legislation are vocal in their belief that House Bill 29 essentially legalizes voter intimidation, which they argue could skew election results to favor Republican candidates. The implications of the bill extend beyond the ballot box, fueling fears of disenfranchisement among various communities and exacerbating divisions in an already polarized political climate.

As the debate over House Bill 29 unfolds, it exemplifies a broader national conversation on voting rights and access to the polls. Proponents argue that measures like poll watching are necessary to maintain election integrity, while critics emphasize that such practices can turn legitimate voting into a battleground fraught with hostility and intimidation. 

As Election Day nears, the impact of House Bill 29 on Pennsylvania's electoral landscape remains to be seen. With concerns mounting over voter suppression and the potential for increased challenges at polling stations, the bill could mark a significant turning point in how elections are administered within the state. 

In a climate where every vote matters, the dynamics surrounding House Bill 29 may not only influence the upcoming election but could also set a precedent for future voting legislation across the nation. As advocates for voting rights continue to push back against the bill's provisions, the implications for democracy in Pennsylvania and beyond continue to grow increasingly significant.",-19.0,-9.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,578.0,-0.45,-0.015570934256055362

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an American Olympian fencer renowned for being the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab, has recently opened up about her feelings of unsafety and experiences with racism in America. Muhammad recounted a distressing incident where she was followed home by an individual who attempted to report her to the police, illustrating a climate of concern for her personal safety.

While reflecting on her experiences, Muhammad made a significant distinction, emphasizing that while her encounters with racism are challenging, they pale in comparison to the more terrifying incidents that have occurred in the country, such as the tragic shooting in North Carolina and the hateful rhetoric directed towards the Khan family at the Democratic National Convention. These comparisons serve to highlight the spectrum of racial and religious intolerance in America.

A broader dialogue surrounds the portrayal of the United States as an ""Islamophobic"" nation, particularly in light of recent incidents. Critics of this narrative have pointed out that, statistically, higher hate crime rates are recorded against Jewish individuals than against Muslims, complicating the discussion on religious intolerance.

Conversely, some voices in the commentariat challenge Muhammad's criticisms of America, suggesting that if she finds the environment so unwelcoming, she might consider relocating to a Muslim-majority country. This sentiment is underscored by an argument that posits conditions for Muslims in America are, in fact, more favorable than those in many Islamic nations, where severe punitive measures regarding religious expression and personal freedoms are commonplace.

These dialogues underscore the complexity of the experiences faced by Muslim individuals in the U.S. and the multifaceted nature of discussions surrounding race, religion, and safety. Muhammad's experiences highlight the ongoing challenges faced by many, while also igniting a deeper conversation about the societal norms and safety for minority communities in America.",-23.0,-14.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,347.0,-1.4,-0.040345821325648415
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

Charlotte, NC – A series of events unfolded this week in Charlotte, where what began as a ""peaceful protest"" rapidly devolved into violence and looting after a black police officer shot a black individual. The ensuing chaos has drawn widespread attention and criticism, as citizens grapple with the implications of both the shooting and the subsequent riots.

The protesters, spurred by outrage over the incident, initially gathered to voice their discontent. However, as tensions mounted, the atmosphere shifted dramatically. Eyewitness accounts detail a scene that quickly transitioned from a demonstration to an unsettling spectacle of destruction, with reports of looting and violence sweeping through the streets of Charlotte. Critics of the protestors have been vocal in their condemnation, arguing that there is no justification for such actions, especially in light of the specifics surrounding the shooting.

The protesters' behavior has been labeled disgraceful by many, particularly in response to reports that some demonstrators chose to insult an injured police officer during the turmoil. Such actions have raised questions about the ethos of those protesting, with some suggesting that these behaviors undermine legitimate grievances and lead to a further erosion of community trust.

Beyond the immediate actions during the protests, there is also an underlying critique aimed at the lifestyles and choices of the protesters. Observers have expressed concern that the current wave of unrest reflects broader social issues, with some labeling the protesters as irresponsible and lacking ambition. This sentiment reinforces a narrative that connects individual choices with community behavior, challenging the capacity for constructive dialogue about social justice and reform.

An essential element of the criticisms directed towards the movement centers on the Black Lives Matter organization. Some detractors argue that the movement, while ostensibly advocating for black lives, fails to genuinely uphold those values when violence erupts within the community. This viewpoint raises the contentious question of whether the organization and its supporters are working towards a peaceful solution or if, instead, they inadvertently perpetuate cycles of violence that detract from legitimate concerns about police brutality.

In the aftermath of the protests, a narrative has emerged suggesting that the actions observed amongst certain groups of protesters might be contributing to a negative perception of black individuals in general. Critics argue that if prominent segments within the community resort to violence and aggression, it lays the groundwork for broader stigmatization that can overshadow the legitimate and pressing issues faced by many African Americans today. This raises significant questions about representation, identity, and the ongoing struggle for equality.

Moreover, there is a growing assertion that one's character should not be assessed solely on the basis of skin color. Many voices in the community have begun to advocate for a more nuanced understanding that emphasizes actions rather than race as the criteria for judgment. This perspective seeks to distance constructive dialogue from race-based assumptions, arguing that behaviors and choices, rather than racial identity, should define a person's worth and contributions to society.

In light of these developments, the strong disdain held by some against the Black Lives Matter movement and its supporters has become increasingly pronounced. There is a troubling sentiment that rather than fostering unity and understanding, actions taken in the name of justice may exacerbate divisions and perpetuate societal rifts. This viewpoint reflects a broader desire among critics to find solutions that are rooted in accountability and responsibility, rather than in reactionary violence and disruption.

As Charlotte begins to recover from the upheaval, it remains to be seen how the community will confront the challenges that lie ahead. The interactions between law enforcement and the community are poised to be more critical than ever, as the search for meaningful change continues amidst the backdrop of unrest. The conversation surrounding race, justice, and community responsibility is likely to evolve in the wake of these events, with many hoping for a return to constructive dialogue rather than strife.",-83.0,-62.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,724.0,-2.3846153846153846,-0.0856353591160221
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In a striking conclusion to his presidency, Barack Obama delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly that has drawn sharp criticism from many quarters. Obama, often characterized as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal, used the platform to advocate for a more interconnected global framework, which he referred to as a one-world order.

Critics have been quick to label his administration's policies, such as the Affordable Care Act and stringent gun control measures, as ridiculous. During his address, Obama made statements regarding American freedom that many found controversial. He suggested that the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms in pursuit of global security, relying on international institutions like the United Nations to facilitate this change.

While he emphasized the importance of personal self-defense rights remaining intact, many commentators were unsettled by his call for a recalibration of freedoms in the name of collective security. “If the leader of the free world cannot identify a path for compromise, it becomes increasingly unlikely that others in Washington D.C. will be able to find common ground,” remarked a political analyst reflecting on the speech’s implications.

Obama acknowledged the division his views have created, stating that he is aware of the critiques directed at him by many Americans. Despite the backlash, he remains steadfast in his beliefs, which some describe as pompous and indicative of a refusal to compromise. This stance has arguably deepened the divisions within American politics, raising questions about the future of bipartisan cooperation.

As Obama prepares to step down from office, his legacy remains contentious. The reactions to his United Nations speech underscore a broader unease within Washington, D.C., about the balance between national autonomy and global security. With his tenure characterized by significant policy battles, the challenge remains for future leaders to bridge the divides that now seem entrenched in the nation's capital.",13.0,9.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,366.0,0.6923076923076923,0.02459016393442623
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In a world where sports figures can significantly influence public opinion, the narratives surrounding two notable NFL players, Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick, highlight a striking contrast in reputation and approach to activism. Both men, once celebrated quarterbacks, now find themselves not in starting roles, yet their public personas vary widely.

Tim Tebow has earned a reputation as a respected individual, known for his strong values and positive contributions to society. In contrast, Colin Kaepernick's tenure in the league has been marred by controversy, leading to a perceived negative image. The heart of the debate lies in Kaepernick's protest during the National Anthem, a move that sparked nationwide conversation about race and social justice. Tebow offered a brief but poignant comment on the matter, stating the importance of ""standing for something"" in a manner that aligns with one's values. This sentiment underscores his commitment to respect and integrity.

Critics argue that Kaepernick's actions across the field can be seen as disrespectful, particularly given that he has accrued millions while largely sitting on the sidelines as a bench player. The author of this piece explicitly criticizes Kaepernick for not using his platform to voice his concerns outside of football-related events. They suggest that social media or protests in non-sporting contexts would provide a more fitting outlet for his views, free from the environment of competition and the expectations of fans.

The contention extends beyond personal actions to broader societal claims of oppression. The author challenges the notion that anyone in the United States is truly oppressed, arguing these assertions can often serve as excuses for inactivity. They draw attention to former President Barack Obama as a prime example of an individual who overcame significant obstacles through hard work and determination, effectively casting doubt on the concept of systemic oppression.

This perspective extends further to policies such as affirmative action, which the author labels as a form of oppression for individuals who may lose job opportunities as a direct result. Such assertions provoke thought on the complexities of social policies and their impact on different demographics.

Amidst these discussions, Tebow emerges as a figure who maintains his focus on personal growth, hoping to secure a spot on the New York Mets. His deliberate avoidance of negative press reinforces his image as a wise, measured individual, committed to his own path.

In closing, this exploration of Tebow and Kaepernick serves to highlight divergent philosophies not just in sports, but in life. While Tebow stands as a beacon of positivity, Kaepernick's approach invites scrutiny and skepticism. As the debate continues, the differing paths of these athletes illuminate broader conversations about values, respect, and the roles of public figures in addressing societal issues.",-6.0,20.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,514.0,1.0,0.038910505836575876
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

In the ongoing debate over immigration policies and national security, the construction of a border wall has emerged as a crucial topic. Advocates argue that the wall serves a dual purpose: preventing illegal immigration and acting as a national security measure. The historical precedent of defensive barriers is not new; for instance, China famously erected the Great Wall to safeguard against foreign invaders, underscoring the long-standing practice of nations protecting their sovereignty.

In the current geopolitical climate, the southern border of the United States poses significant concerns. Reports indicate that drug cartels maintain a stronghold in Mexico, inflicting a staggering death toll that some experts compare to that of terrorist organizations like ISIS. The escalating violence and instability in the region raise alarm bells, particularly regarding potential threats of infiltration by extremist groups into the U.S.

A recent incident has further amplified these security concerns. Eight Syrian nationals were intercepted while attempting to enter the United States illegally from Mexico. This event took place at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, highlighting vulnerabilities at the southern border. Hector Garza, President of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, confirmed the reports concerning the detained individuals and expressed apprehension among Border Patrol agents regarding the broader security implications of such crossings.

The situation is exacerbated by systemic flaws within current border enforcement strategies. Alarming statistics reveal that 80% of individuals caught entering the U.S. illegally are not deported, a fact that raises questions about the effectiveness of existing measures. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, there is a growing chorus calling for stronger border security and enhanced support for Border Patrol operations.

Amid these discussions, several political figures are emerging with promises to bolster border security efforts. Among them is a Presidential candidate advocating for comprehensive reforms aimed at addressing the gaps in the current enforcement framework. This candidate emphasizes the need for increased resources and strategic enhancements to ensure that the southern border is fortified against potential threats.

As the debate around immigration and national security intensifies, the situation at the southern border remains a critical focal point. The urgency for effective solutions grows as reports of illegal crossings expose potential risks to national safety and the integrity of U.S. borders. The calls for action reflect a desire for a balanced approach that prioritizes both security and humanitarian considerations in the complex landscape of immigration.",-13.0,-17.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,446.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.03811659192825112

These people LOVED Trump. They cheered for him, he sat quietly as they told their stories.

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

At a recent event featuring former President Donald Trump, members of the Haitian community voiced their support for Trump, sharing personal experiences that elicited cheers from the crowd. Despite this enthusiasm, media representatives reportedly left the gathering prematurely, failing to document the audience's positive reactions towards the former president.

During the event, audience members articulated strong grievances against the Clintons, specifically criticizing their absence following donations intended for Haiti. Attendees claimed that much of the aid meant for the island nation did not benefit the impoverished population but instead favored Washington lobbyists and interests tied to the White House.

The crowd also directed pointed allegations at Hillary Clinton, asserting that she had obstructed efforts to increase Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5. As the atmosphere shifted, with the audience expressing negative sentiments towards Hillary Clinton and positive feelings towards Trump, the media's early exit raised eyebrows. Critics argue that their departure came at a moment deemed ""not worth reporting,"" suggesting a conscious avoidance of unfavorable coverage for Trump.

The event highlighted a palpable disconnect between the media narrative and the sentiments of the Haitian audience, who felt their voices and concerns were overlooked.

Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a provocative move reminiscent of U.S. political discourse, former President Donald Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim immigration has reignited discussions around national security, cultural integration, and societal values. The ban, articulated as a necessary measure to prevent terrorist infiltration, has drawn both support and criticism on an international scale.

Critics, particularly from the Democratic Party, have labeled Trump’s proposal as a manifestation of racism. However, it is important to clarify that racism traditionally pertains to notions of racial superiority, while Islam represents a religious identity. Therefore, labeling a proposal against Muslim immigration as racist raises questions about the accuracy of such an accusation, particularly in the context of security concerns that Trump has cited.

Recent surveys suggest that a significant portion of the Australian populace aligns with Trump’s sentiment. A new poll indicates that 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration—an alarming increase from 28% just a year ago. This marked shift in public opinion reflects deeper fears surrounding terrorism and growing apprehensions regarding the integration of Muslim migrants into Australian culture.

In exploring the broader political landscape, 48% of Australians express a desire for a national debate on this contentious issue. Such a substantial interest in deliberation underscores the complexity of public sentiment surrounding immigration policies and the need for open discourse. Notably, the poll reveals that two-thirds of respondents identify with the views of populist senator Pauline Hanson, who has previously stirred controversy with her positions on immigration and multiculturalism.

The primary concerns driving support for a ban center on national security fears, with many voters voicing beliefs that recent immigrant populations, particularly from Muslim-majority countries, have failed to adequately integrate into Australian society. This sentiment resonates across party lines, with 60% of respondents affiliated with the right-wing Coalition, 40% of Labour voters, and even 34% of Green voters advocating for an end to Muslim migration. 

Interestingly, the pollster acknowledges this considerable backing for opposing viewpoints, challenging the prevailing narrative that positions such as Trump’s are limited to fringe elements of society. This growing consensus may signal a shift in the public’s tolerance toward alternative views, prompting political leaders and commentators to reassess their positions and strategies.

The response from political figures like Hillary Clinton has also drawn scrutiny. Critics argue that dismissing opposing viewpoints not only undermines the validity of public concern but also fails to recognize the emerging discourse surrounding immigration in various countries, including Australia. The article encourages civic engagement and dialogue, urging political leaders to acknowledge widespread dissent and foster constructive discussions that address the fears and aspirations of the electorate.

As Australia grapples with these complex issues, the need for responsible dialogue on immigration and cultural integration has never been more pressing. The stakes are not merely political; they permeate into the societal fabric, forcing citizens to confront their values and the direction they envision for their nation. Whether one perceives the support for a ban on Muslim immigration as a legitimate security measure or an expression of prejudice, the growing willingness among Australians to discuss such matters represents a significant shift in the national conversation.

In conclusion, as the debate continues to evolve, the necessity for a comprehensive and respectful approach to discussing immigration policies remains crucial. With such large segments of the population feeling the need to engage on this topic, a national debate could pave the way for a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities that come with diverse immigration policies.",2.0,-3.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,665.0,-0.13043478260869565,-0.004511278195488722

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on

In a disturbing turn of events, a chaotic incident unfolded in the middle of a street where individuals had gathered for what was expected to be a fistfight. Eyewitnesses reported that the situation quickly escalated when a perpetrator unexpectedly doused the fighters in flames, leading to a horrifying scene that left many spectators in shock. 

As the individuals engulfed in fire stumbled into oncoming traffic, the image was both alarming and dangerous. With flames consuming their bodies, these individuals not only posed a significant threat to themselves but also created a potentially deadly situation for drivers navigating the chaos. The reckless act prompted immediate concern from witnesses who found themselves grappling with the surreal and alarming nature of the event unfolding before them.

In light of this incident, Buzzfeed has since reported that the initial description of both the crime and the victims was inaccurate. This false narrative has been debunked, and a follow-up article is now available, further complicating perceptions surrounding the events that transpired.

The motivations behind the perpetrator's actions have been met with bewilderment. Many have questioned the level of premeditation involved in such an extreme response to a street altercation. It raises a troubling question: what drives an individual to escalate a fight to such dangerous and life-threatening extremes? 

Norwood, a reflective observer of societal dynamics, weighed in on this disturbing incident by recalling a time when community members would step in to prevent harm during physical confrontations. Today, however, there seems to be a troubling shift in behavior. Rather than intervening, many have taken to recording the violence on their phones, prioritizing the capture of sensational footage over the human instinct to help others in peril. 

This critical observation raises alarm bells about the nature of human behavior in the face of violence. As bystanders turned into passive observers, the call for collective action grows louder. It is imperative that society re-evaluates its response to acts of violence and the well-being of individuals involved in such altercations.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Importance of a border wall for securing access to America and preventing illegal immigration.

Recent events in Luna County, New Mexico, have reignited discussions concerning the importance of a border wall in securing access to America and preventing illegal immigration. During a routine traffic stop, local police discovered an undocumented woman from the Middle East who reportedly possessed plans for a gas pipeline. Although described as an ""Islamic refugee,"" authorities were unable to determine the woman's precise intentions regarding the pipeline.

In light of this incident, the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol became involved in the investigation. Fortunately, no immediate threats were identified. However, the remote location of the pipeline has led to speculation that the woman may have been scoping out potential terror targets. This has raised alarms, especially considering her undocumented status and her proximity to the southern border of the United States.

Concerns about border security are not unfounded. A 2015 report by Judicial Watch indicated that Mexican cartels are collaborating with terrorist organizations to smuggle individuals from nations afflicted by terrorism into the U.S. Additionally, a 2017 report from the same organization highlighted incidents of Mexico-based Islamic terror groups illegally crossing into the U.S. to identify potential targets for attack. This trend amplifies the urgency for enhanced border security measures.

Given the alarming news of potential threats crossing through the southern border, the call for Congress to approve funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall has gained momentum. Advocates of the wall stress its essential role in safeguarding national security against not only terrorist activities but also drug cartel operations that have become increasingly sophisticated.

The issue of illegal immigration has seen many individuals entering the U.S. from regions south of Mexico, often with increasing support, albeit indirectly, from the Mexican government. The vulnerability of the southern border as an entry point augments concerns that terrorists might exploit this avenue to launch attacks against American targets.

Proponents of the border wall view its construction as critical for securing the nation against various foreign threats. Enhanced physical barriers at the southern border are argued to serve as a deterrent to both illegal immigration and potential terrorist incursions. 

As the situation evolves, the need for robust border security strategies remains a pressing matter in national discussions surrounding safety and immigration policy. The incident in Luna County, coupled with historical reports of collaboration between cartels and terrorist groups, illustrates the complex challenges faced in safeguarding the United States. Without decisive action, the potential for misuse of the southern border remains a significant concern for national security officials and the public alike.",-44.0,-35.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,478.0,-1.8421052631578947,-0.07322175732217573

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Seattle, WA - In a world often clouded by corruption and deception, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands as a beacon of hope and positive leadership. Known for his impressive athletic abilities on the field, Wilson is equally distinguished by his strong faith in God and his unwavering commitment to guiding others towards a life filled with joy through good choices, hope, and faith.

Wilson openly prioritizes his life with a clear hierarchical structure: God first, family and friends second, and football third. This perspective shapes his daily actions and decisions, underscoring his belief that adhering to these principles not only bolsters his personal life but also instills a sense of purpose in his professional role. “I firmly believe that keeping these priorities leads to positive outcomes and reduces stress,” Wilson stated in a recent interview. His focus on spiritual values and relationships serves as a foundation for his life's work, both on and off the field.

Despite facing restrictions from the NFL on explicitly discussing matters of faith, Wilson remains resolute in sharing his message through his actions. He has built a reputation for philanthropy and community support, emphasizing that serving others can and should be a priority, rather than an afterthought. This commitment to helping others, however, is sometimes seen in a negative light, raising an important question about the societal perception of such selflessness in certain contexts.

As Wilson strives to uplift individuals and communities, the stark contrast between his positive example and that of some leaders who seem to have lost their values is apparent. In today’s climate, where instances of corruption and dishonesty can overshadow authentic leadership, Wilson’s conviction stands out. He exemplifies how a public figure can embrace their faith and inspire others, regardless of the pressures surrounding them.

The NFL’s stance on religious expression compounds the discussion around Wilson's leadership. While players can often express controversial opinions—including those that may show disrespect towards the country—discussing personal faith remains a contentious topic. This disparity raises eyebrows and sparks debate about the league's position on fostering an environment of openness regarding personal beliefs. Critics argue that the NFL's policies reflect a larger issue within society, where the notion of 'tolerance' obscures moral clarity, leaving ambiguous the line between good and evil.

Wilson's approach to life—anchored by his faith and prioritization of people over the game—celebrates a different kind of legacy within professional sports. His message encourages young athletes to recognize the significance of their choices, imploring them to consider how their actions impact not only their lives but the lives of those around them.

In a time where negative portrayals seem to dominate discussions about leadership, Russell Wilson emerges as a figure committed to accountability and moral integrity. His legacy aims to not only inspire current and aspiring athletes but also encourage individuals from all walks of life to believe in the transformative power of faith, compassion, and service.

In closing, as Wilson continues to navigate the challenges of being an NFL quarterback while holding close his faith and values, he stands ready to inspire change both on and off the field. His unwavering commitment to bringing joy and positivity into the lives of others demonstrates that true leadership extends far beyond the game, highlighting the importance of prioritizing what truly matters—faith, family, and a steadfast resolve to uplift those around us.",79.0,75.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,641.0,3.409090909090909,0.11700468018720749
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a powerful address aimed at journalists in Italy, Pope Francis delivered a stark warning regarding the pervasive influence of fear-based media practices, equating such journalism with acts of ""terrorism."" The Pope's comments specifically targeted outlets that rely on gossip and rumors, suggesting that these forms of media serve to perpetuate destructive stereotypes and cultivate a culture of fear, particularly towards migrants.

Speaking to members of the Italian press, Pope Francis emphasized the ethical responsibility of journalists, highlighting the potential harm their narratives can inflict on individuals and communities. He noted that the power of their voices could be wielded as a weapon, capable of inflicting long-lasting damage. His message, while directly addressing the Italian press, aimed to resonate on a broader scale, encouraging journalists worldwide to reflect on their role in shaping public perception.

The Pope’s condemnation of sensationalist media comes in the context of rising nationalistic sentiments within Italy and across the globe. He called for a more responsible approach to journalism, insisting that the prevalence of fear-mongering in media contributes not only to misunderstandings about migrants but also to societal unrest. 

The connection between fear-inducing media narratives and political dynamics has been increasingly scrutinized, particularly in the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Analysts have noted that the climate of fear drawn from media coverage has paralleled the rise of figures such as Donald Trump, who capitalized on public anxieties regarding crime and terrorism. Interestingly, despite overwhelming media portrayals, actual crime rates have significantly decreased over the past few years.

Yet, the fears of the American public remain heightened. Recent surveys indicate that concerns over terrorism and crime have surged to levels not seen in over a decade, creating a landscape of anxiety. Contributing factors include mass shootings, political protests, and a general sense of disorder that stretches across various aspects of society. 

Among the influential players in the current media landscape, Fox News has been singled out as a notable source of fear-based narratives. Reports indicate that the network has effectively heightened public anxiety, especially in the lead-up to elections, creating an environment ripe for misinformation and heightened fear. 

Pope Francis's call for a more compassionate and responsible media landscape serves as a reminder of the profound impact journalism holds in molding societal attitudes and behaviors. As the world faces numerous challenges, his message urges a re-evaluation of media practices to foster understanding rather than fear, particularly towards marginalized communities. The Pope’s vision for a fear-free narrative challenges journalists to prioritize truth over sensationalism.",-56.0,-39.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,483.0,-2.1666666666666665,-0.08074534161490683
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

- Julian Assange hinted at an upcoming October surprise that could impact Clinton’s campaign.","In a tightly contested inaugural debate of the general election, CNN polling crowned Hillary Clinton the victor, while a series of alternate polls suggested a different narrative, favoring Donald Trump. As voters navigate through the heated electoral landscape, the debate centered around crucial issues including the Birther movement, Clinton’s email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns.

CNN's snap poll indicated a significant lead for Clinton, with 62% of respondents declaring her the better debater compared to Trump's 27%. However, this result sparked debates regarding its credibility after the network acknowledged that its sample pool skewed more Democratic, prompting questions about the reliability of such outcomes. Meanwhile, mixed reactions emerged within the CNN poll itself, indicating uncertainty over whether the debate would ultimately sway voter opinion as the election draws closer.

The divergence in polling results highlighted a complex landscape. Snap polls conducted by prominent sources such as TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, and CBS New York presented varying perspectives on which candidate performed better, illustrating the fickle nature of immediate voter sentiment.

In the wake of the debate, Trump expressed appreciation through Twitter for the support reflected in the polls that favored him, while Clinton notably refrained from commenting on the polling outcomes. Trump took the opportunity during the debate to mention what he claimed was a defective microphone, adding a dramatic flair to the evening's discourse. He also suggested that he could have delved deeper into Bill Clinton’s history of infidelity, a topic that remains controversial in campaign discussions.

As the days count down to the November election, both candidates face a pressing urgency to cement their voter bases and reach undecided electors. In a cryptic turn of events, Julian Assange hinted at an October surprise, a development that could potentially shake up the political climate and impact Clinton’s campaign in the final stretch. With so much at stake, each debate and public appearance becomes crucial in the candidates' efforts to secure a path to victory.",18.0,18.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,375.0,1.3846153846153846,0.048
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, Hillary Clinton declared victory, igniting a wave of criticism regarding the timing and validity of her claim. Focus groups conducted by major networks, Fox News and CNN, indicated that Clinton had the upper hand against rival Donald Trump during the debate, yet opinions varied significantly among viewers.

CNN's focus group, composed of Florida voters, exhibited strong support for Clinton, with results showing an 18-2 advantage in her favor. Conversely, a focus group led by noted analyst Frank Luntz at Fox News reported a narrower margin, with Clinton receiving 16 votes to Trump's 6. This divergence highlights the polarized perceptions surrounding the candidates.

Luntz noted specific struggles for Trump during the debate, particularly in discussing his taxes. However, he observed that the former president managed to regain some footing when addressing Clinton's email scandal, a point that resonated more positively with his supporters. Trump's performance faltered when he attempted to clarify his previous comments regarding Barack Obama's birthplace, further complicating his debate strategy.

In an unexpected twist, a separate poll emerged indicating Trump as the winner, claiming a staggering 92% to 8% advantage. This stark contrast to focus group results adds another layer to the ongoing debate about who truly won the night.

Clinton's declaration of victory sparked significant discussion on social media, where the hashtag #TrumpWon began trending in response to her tweet. Critics took to Twitter, questioning Clinton’s assertion and pointing out her tendency to evade media inquiries following the debate. 

While focus groups may suggest a decisive win for Clinton, the varied perceptions from polls and social media underscore the ongoing division among voters. As both sides evaluate their performances, the question of who truly emerged victorious from the debate remains a contentious topic. As the election approaches, these discussions will likely influence public sentiment and voter behavior.",18.0,19.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,368.0,1.2666666666666666,0.051630434782608696
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted in Charlotte for the second consecutive night following the tragic police killing of 29-year-old Kenneth L. Scott. The protests, originally intended as peaceful demonstrations, quickly escalated into chaotic scenes as tensions between demonstrators and law enforcement heightened.

The protests began in response to the shocking news of Scott’s death, which has ignited widespread anger and grief in the community. Participants, many of whom demanded justice for Scott's killing, chanted slogans and waved signs, including the powerful message: ""Hands Up, Don’t Shoot."" The movement reflects a growing frustration with systemic issues surrounding police use of force and accountability.

However, the atmosphere shifted tragically when a civilian was shot in the head amid the demonstrations and critically injured. Authorities initially claimed that the shooter was a civilian, a statement that has sparked significant controversy and led to widespread skepticism among attendees and observers.

Witnesses present at the scene painted a different picture, suggesting that the injury may have been incurred as a result of law enforcement actions rather than a civilian altercation. Eyewitness Todd Zimmer shared graphic evidence through photos and statements that contradicted law enforcement accounts, heightening concerns about the police response during peaceful protests.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and eyewitness to the shooting, took to social media to insist that he witnessed the incident and disputed claims that the shot was fired by a civilian. Meyer’s statements lend further credibility to the growing body of eyewitness reports that challenge the narrative being perpetuated by the Charlotte police.

As the protests continued into the night, tensions began to escalate further with the arrival of riot police. The sense of hostility was palpable, as protesters felt increasingly threatened by the show of force. Witnesses reported a distinct change in atmosphere, noting that the shot that rang out sounded distinctly louder than a typical gunshot, raising questions about the circumstances surrounding the injury.

In the wake of the shooting incident, police utilized tear gas on the crowd, forcing many protesters to retreat. This response has drawn criticism and accusations from demonstrators, who believe that the police have not only mismanaged the protests but also contributed to the violence that erupted.

Additional eyewitness accounts have pointed towards police responsibility for the shooting, with some demonstrators alleging an ""ambush."" These claims echo a larger narrative of distrust between law enforcement and the public, as many citizens express frustration with a system they feel is quick to dismiss the voices of those protesting against police violence.

The City's official Twitter account initially placed blame for the shooting on a civilian, a statement that has since fueled further outrage among those who question the accuracy of such claims. The community's concern reflects a broader sentiment that the police response to dissent has spiraled out of control, leading to increased violence and chaos.

Eyewitnesses recounted harrowing experiences during the protests, describing chaotic scenes marked by state violence against peaceful protesters. Many expressed deep-seated frustration, anger, and fear, feeling that their right to protest and voice pain was met with hostility and aggression from those sworn to protect and serve.

The mixture of emotions on display at the protests has been palpable. While many march for justice in honor of Kenneth L. Scott, others fear for their safety amidst police enforcement. As tensions rise, the need for accountability and open dialogue between law enforcement and the community becomes increasingly urgent.

The events of the past two nights have underscored the need for a critical examination of police practices, particularly during protests. Calls for reform and accountability have intensified, with demonstrators demanding answers and justice not only for Scott but for all victims of police violence.

In Charlotte, the aftermath of the protests has left the community grappling with difficult questions about justice, safety, and the role of police in managing civil unrest. As more information and eyewitness accounts emerge, the narrative surrounding Scott’s death and subsequent protests continues to evolve, shaping public perception and demanding a response from both city officials and law enforcement agencies.

For now, the streets of Charlotte remain a stage for passionate discourse, as residents insist on their right to be heard and to seek justice for those they have lost. With the community still reeling from the tragic loss of Scott, the way forward remains uncertain. Further discussions about police accountability, systemic reform, and the protection of civil liberties will be critical in navigating the complex landscape of social justice movements in the city.

As Charlotte continues to rally together, many are determined that Kenneth L. Scott’s legacy will not be forgotten, and that the fight for justice and equality will persist, with or without the approval of those in power. The protests may have taken a violent turn, but the underlying message remains clear: the people of Charlotte are demanding change.",-74.0,-115.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,921.0,-3.3823529411764706,-0.1248642779587405
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As Donald Trump continues to solidify his position as the Republican nominee for the upcoming presidential election, he faces increasing scrutiny over alleged treasonous ties to Russia and support for President Vladimir Putin's ambitions. These serious accusations have emerged in the wake of ongoing investigations into Trump's associations with individuals who reportedly have close connections to the Kremlin and Russian oligarchs.

Despite the mounting evidence, Trump has staunchly denied any business ties to Russia, claiming in a July tweet that he has “ZERO investments in Russia.” However, a recent investigation by ABC News challenges this assertion, revealing that Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests, with these connections valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Among those asserting the potential financial links is Sergei Millian, head of a U.S.-Russia business group, who claims that many Russian businessmen were enthusiastic about the prospect of working with Trump. This enthusiasm appears justified, as Trump's financial ventures have included hosting the Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013, as well as selling real estate to numerous Russian buyers. Areas in Florida, notably Sunny and Hollywood Islands, have earned the nickname “Little Moscow” due to the high concentration of Russian buyers in these locales. 

The context of these transactions also sheds light on the nature of Russian oligarchs, who made vast fortunes during the transition to a free-market economy in Russia by acquiring shares in state-owned companies. These wealthy individuals not only control a significant portion of Russian financial resources but also use their immense wealth to bolster the Putin regime. Reports indicate that they allegedly utilize investments in Trump properties as a means of laundering money out of Russia, further casting a shadow over Trump's dealings.

Further complicating the narrative is the perspective of former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who depicts these oligarchs as both materialistic and culturally ignorant, suggesting that their motivations in engaging with Trump are rooted primarily in financial gain rather than any ideological alignment. This commentary adds a layer of complexity to the ongoing debate about the nature of Trump's relationships with Russia. 

The implications of the U.S. sanctions imposed in 2014 against these Russian oligarchs cannot be overlooked. These sanctions were intended to limit the money-laundering options available to them, an essential measure in the wider context of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. However, Trump has hinted that he would reconsider these sanctions if elected president, prompting serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest. The prospect that personal financial interests could influence U.S. policies towards Russia represents a significant and alarming issue for voters and policymakers alike.

As the campaign season progresses, the potential influence of Trump's alleged financial ties to Russian interests has become a focal point of criticism from various political commentators and opponents. They caution that such ties could compromise U.S. foreign policy and national security, particularly in light of Russia's historical aggressions and ongoing geopolitical ambitions.

Amid these escalating allegations, calls for accountability remind observers of the gravity of the situation. There is a growing discourse around the necessity of reconsidering Trump's candidacy based on these findings. Activists and citizens are advocating for measures that would prevent him from assuming the presidency, even suggesting the possibility of impeachment should he win the election and these accusations be proven true.

In conclusion, Donald Trump’s connections to Russian oligarchs and interests raise formidable questions concerning his fitness for the presidency. As the political landscape becomes increasingly fraught with allegations, the implications of these ties for U.S. foreign policy are a cause for concern. With voices calling for action against a potential Trump presidency growing louder, the coming months promise to be pivotal in determining not only the outcome of the election but the future direction of U.S.-Russia relations.",27.0,6.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,705.0,0.2608695652173913,0.00851063829787234
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie finds himself at the center of a political storm as state legislators contemplate potential impeachment due to his alleged involvement in the ""Bridgegate"" scandal. The controversy, which centers around orchestrated bridge closures intended as retribution against a political rival, has drawn scrutiny from both state officials and federal prosecutors. 

Top legislators in New Jersey are actively considering the implications of filing articles of impeachment should investigations prove Christie's guilt. This initiative hinges on whether a thorough inquiry establishes that Christie played a direct role in the infamous lane closures that caused significant traffic congestion and contributed to a tragic death. 

A significant development in this case came when a judge mandated that Christie produce personal emails pertinent to the scandal, adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing legal challenges he faces. The ultimate decision regarding the potential impeachment of the governor rests in the hands of Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. Should Prieto approve the move, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would commence the impeachment process, setting the stage for a potentially historic political event.

For impeachment to succeed, a majority vote of the 80-member Assembly is essential, followed by a two-thirds majority in the state Senate for conviction. Should the impeachment proceedings advance, Christie would become one of the few governors in U.S. history to face such a consequence.

Amid this turmoil, federal prosecutors have implicated Christie directly in the ongoing trial concerning three senior aides. The indictment accuses him of orchestrating the bridge shutdowns, an act that profoundly affected the daily lives of New Jersey residents and drew national attention. The scandal has overshadowed Christie's political career, particularly following his role as the transition team chairperson for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. His endorsement of Trump, many political analysts argue, has drastically undermined his own presidential ambitions.

In the aftermath of his re-election in November 2014, Christie publicly denied any knowledge of the Bridgegate scandal during a press conference. However, subsequent evidence and revelations have painted a contrasting picture, challenging the integrity of his previous statements. New disclosures suggest that Christie was indeed aware of the bridge closures during a solemn 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 yet failed to take any corrective actions at that moment.

These new pieces of information have intensified calls for accountability, as the allegations of deceit pose a profound threat to Christie's political future. Critics argue that by potentially lying about his administration's actions, Christie has not only jeopardized his governorship but has also eroded public trust in his leadership.

The implications of these developments extend far beyond New Jersey, as Christie's situation reflects broader political dynamics within the Republican Party and the ongoing reverberations of the Trump presidency. As these events unfold, New Jersey residents and observers nationwide will be closely monitoring how Christie navigates the mounting scrutiny and whether legislators take decisive action that could lead to his impeachment.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a highly charged atmosphere of the Republican primary debate in September 2015, the then-presidential candidate Donald Trump made a bold claim regarding his interactions with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, particularly in relation to casino gambling in Florida. Trump's assertion that he never lobbied Bush for casino gambling raised eyebrows and prompted scrutiny from various political analysts and commentators.

During the debate, Trump insisted that had he wished to push for casino gambling, he would have been successful. This assertion stands in stark contrast to previous statements made by Trump during a civil court deposition in 2007, where he explicitly indicated that he had, in fact, sought to influence Governor Bush on matters of casino gambling. The apparent discrepancies between Trump's debate statements and his earlier deposition lend themselves to further exploration, particularly regarding the implications of these conflicting narratives.

If Trump's claim made during the debate is proven false, it raises significant questions about the integrity of his testimony during the deposition. This situation suggests the possibility of perjury, as his admission in 2007 directly contradicts his denial in 2015. Such contradictory statements taint Trump's credibility and could indicate a troubling pattern of dishonesty—a characteristic that many critics argue is detrimental to effective leadership.

At the debate, Jeb Bush challenged Trump's claim head-on, stating that Trump had, indeed, sought to exert influence over him regarding his position on gambling. The former governor's challenge did not go unanswered. Trump, in true form, interrupted Bush, vehemently denying any attempts at lobbying and confidently asserting that if he had truly wanted to pursue casino gambling in Florida, it would have been realized.

However, the 2007 deposition paints a different picture. In this legal setting, Trump openly acknowledged his attempts to engage with Governor Bush on the topic of gaming, revealing that he recognized Bush's steadfast opposition to casino gambling. This clash of narratives raises significant ethical questions about the former businessman turned politician's commitment to truthfulness when addressing crucial matters of state.

The implications of these contrasting accounts resonate beyond mere political rhetoric; they draw parallels to historical precedents, notably the impeachment proceedings against former President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. Clinton’s impeachment revolved around accusations of perjury related to his own misleading statements made under oath, much like what Trump faces as a result of this apparent inconsistency. Such comparisons serve to remind the American public of the weighty consequences of dishonesty, especially among those holding powerful positions.

Emphasizing the importance of truthfulness in leadership, critics argue that Trump’s behavior not only raises questions about his integrity but also poses a broader threat to national safety and governance. Trust between citizens and their leaders is paramount in any democratic society, and the erosion of that trust is highlighted by dissonant claims made by individuals in positions of authority. The ramifications of such actions could be far-reaching, affecting not just political discourse but also public confidence in the governing process.

Calls for action are being voiced, urging Congress to take a stand against Trump’s alleged crimes by initiating impeachment proceedings. Advocates for accountability underscore the necessity of ensuring that leaders remain transparent and truthful in order to safeguard the integrity of the political system. For many, the allegations surrounding Trump echo a sense of urgency to uphold the principles of honesty and integrity that are foundational to effective governance.

The discourse surrounding Trump's statements on gambling in Florida exemplifies the broader issues at play within the American political landscape. As the 2024 elections approach, the scrutiny surrounding Trump's past actions and statements may evolve, yet the core questions about honesty and accountability will remain at the forefront.

In reflecting upon Trump’s debating tactics and past admissions, one cannot help but consider the broader implications of his leadership style. The evidence presenting a contradiction between Trump’s 2015 debate remarks and his 2007 deposition raises serious concerns regarding whether voters can trust the proclamations of someone seeking to hold the highest office in the nation. For many constituents, this issue transcends partisan lines, focusing instead on the fundamental need for trustworthy leadership in addressing the critical challenges facing the country.

As the political landscape continues to be shaped by personal narratives and the public's perception of honesty, the upcoming years may witness increased scrutiny of politicians' past behaviors. This serves as a reminder that integrity should not be a negotiable quality in those who aspire to lead. With the American public becoming more discerning in its evaluations of candidates, the focus on a candidate's moral compass, especially in light of undeniable contradictions, may influence electoral outcomes.

Ultimately, the integrity of the political arena relies on the ability of leaders to place honesty at the forefront of their public persona. The allegations surrounding Trump, from his 2007 deposition to his assertions during the Republican debate, highlight an urgent need for an unyielding commitment to truthfulness—an imperative demand of any leader who wishes to command the respect and trust of their constituents.

As calls for accountability grow louder, the examination of Trump's statements and actions serves both as a cautionary tale and a clarion call for greater transparency and integrity in political leadership. The direction of political discourse going forward will likely hinge on how these crucial issues regarding honesty and leadership accountability are addressed by both the electorate and Congress alike. 

In conclusion, whether Trump’s claim during the debate was a misrepresentation of his past or whether his deposition was a moment of dishonesty, the potential consequences surrounding these discrepancies are significant. As voters become more attuned to these critical elements of leadership, the demand for truthful engagement in the political sphere will only intensify, delineating the path forward for future candidates and the political landscape itself.",-29.0,25.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,1090.0,0.6756756756756757,0.022935779816513763
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a commercial-free debate drinking game on CNN.

- Viewers are reminded to drink responsibly during future debates, especially concerning Trump's lying habits.","**Surgeon General Issues Warning About Drinking Games During CNN Debate**

As the CNN audience gathered to participate in a commercial-free debate drinking game, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a stark reminder about the potential health risks involved. Citing concerns that drinking games tied to Donald Trump's propensity for misinformation could lead to alcohol poisoning, Murthy emphasized the dangers that such games pose, particularly as this year's Republican debates unfold.

Historically, events of this nature have resulted in alarming statistics. During the 2012 debates, there were approximately 70,000 reported cases of alcohol poisoning, a troubling trend that prompted Murthy to address safety concerns in 2015. The Surgeon General's warnings are not unfounded, as he reiterated the risks before the September 26, 2016 debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, particularly when Trump made statements deemed false. 

A notable analysis by Politico highlighted the extent of misinformation, revealing that Trump told 87 lies over a span of just five days, which averaged out to approximately one lie every three minutes and 15 seconds. Based on this metric, it is estimated that Trump could have made around 28 false statements during the recent CNN debate, potentially encouraging viewers to imbibe at alarming rates. Given this context, Murthy cautioned that first responders are already preparing for likely incidents of alcohol-related issues as the debates continue.

The Surgeon General's advice serves as a reminder to debate viewers to approach drinking responsibly, particularly in light of Trump’s established pattern of deceit. As many dive into drinking games designed to enhance their viewing experience, the risk of excessive drinking and the associated health risks cannot be overstated. Murthy’s thoughtful warnings aim to promote safer viewing habits as America engages with its political landscape during these pivotal debates. 

In an age where misinformation can flow freely, viewers are encouraged not just to participate in lively debate traditions, but also to prioritize their health and safety. The mixing of politics, entertainment, and alcohol can create a heady brew that could lead to dire consequences if viewers are not careful.

Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the aftermath of the recent debate, Hillary Clinton was largely declared the winner by mainstream media outlets. However, contrasting narratives emerged from online polling and social media trends, particularly surrounding the hashtag #TrumpWon, which became the top trend in the United States on Twitter. This divergence between traditional coverage and online sentiment brings to light concerns regarding the influence of social media in shaping public opinion.

The hashtag #TrumpWon has roots that can be traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. Reports indicate that Russian state-controlled trolls, infamous for their engagement in disinformation campaigns known as dezinformatsiya, are actively working to stir discord among American social media users. Such activities aim to amplify rivalries and create division within the political landscape.

Observers have noted that these trolls often operate to further the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is believed to support Donald Trump. Analysts posit that a Trump presidency could lead to the lifting of sanctions imposed on Russia following the country's 2014 annexation of Crimea, offering potential benefits to the Kremlin.

Meanwhile, insights from former bloggers reveal troubling work conditions for these trolls, likening them to the grim atmosphere of an internet sweatshop. Reports describe strict fines and constant oversight, which suggest an environment focused on outputting targeted narratives to influence opinion far beyond Russia's borders.

Given the increase in online commentary fueled by these actors, there is a growing call for skepticism regarding the authenticity of online polling results and social media narratives. The considerable traffic and engagement surrounding the hashtag #TrumpWon necessitate scrutiny, as it raises questions about the potential involvement of foreign entities attempting to manipulate discourse in the United States.

In light of these developments, there are renewed calls for action, notably urging Congressional impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. Advocates argue that the integrity of American democracy is at stake, highlighting the need for vigilance against foreign interference and the erosion of public trust.

As the conversation continues to unfold, the implications of social media influence and the intersection of traditional reporting with online ecosystems remain critical topics for further exploration. In an era where digital platforms can sway narratives, a careful evaluation of both media reports and online sentiments is essential in discerning the true landscape of American political opinion.",-9.0,8.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,433.0,0.5,0.018475750577367205
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a data analytics firm co-founded by controversial entrepreneur Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Department of Labor. The lawsuit alleges that the company engaged in discriminatory hiring practices against Asian job applicants, raising serious concerns about workplace diversity and equal opportunity within the tech industry.

According to the lawsuit, filed in a federal court, Palantir purportedly hired only four Asian candidates out of 130 applicants for available positions, despite the applicant pool being comprised of approximately 73% Asians. In stark contrast, the company hired 17 non-Asian applicants. Statistically, this outcome suggests a probability of one in a billion that such a remarkable disparity in hiring could have been random.

The implications of the lawsuit are monumental, highlighting an ongoing issue within many industries regarding the equitable treatment of all job seekers regardless of race or ethnicity. The Department of Labor has firmly stated the requirements federal contractors must adhere to, emphasizing that they must implement non-discriminatory hiring practices to ensure equal employment opportunities are available to all facets of society.

Thiel, who has been a polarizing figure in the business and political landscapes, has long been associated with various high-profile ventures and public endeavors. As a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, Thiel's influence within Silicon Valley is significant. However, he also drew considerable attention for his financial backing of Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker Media, which culminated in a landmark invasion of privacy case that resulted in Gawker's bankruptcy.

Notably, Thiel’s political positions have often been controversial, especially regarding his vocal support for former President Donald Trump, which has led to much discourse around his often contradictory views on immigration. As a first-generation immigrant himself, Thiel’s perspectives are sometimes at odds with established norms within the Republican Party, particularly as many party members have adopted a hardline stance against immigration reform and policies perceived to support immigrant populations.

In a notable instance, Thiel became the first openly gay speaker to address the Republican National Convention, where he underscored the importance of individual identity and acceptance. His presence at the convention sparked discussions about the Republican Party's historical treatment of LGBT individuals, showcasing the complexities of his personal and professional ideologies.

The accusation of discriminatory hiring practices against Palantir raises questions not only about the company’s human resources policies but also about the broader implications for tech firms in America, where diversity and inclusion have gained increasing attention. While tech companies have made substantial commitments toward enhancing workplace diversity, allegations such as those against Palantir illustrate that there are ongoing challenges in effectively executing these promises.

In response to the lawsuit, a spokeswoman for Palantir Technologies has asserted that the company will ""vigorously defend"" itself against the allegations of bias. As this legal battle unfolds, it remains to be seen how it will impact Palantir’s operations, reputation, and potential investor confidence. 

The lawsuit against Palantir is not only about an individual company’s hiring practices but also a reflection of the systemic issues within the tech industry regarding equal opportunity and representation. As the case develops, it may serve as a pivotal moment for federal contractors and tech companies alike, prompting a reevaluation of their hiring protocols and commitment to diversity. 

This legal challenge highlights that the tech sector, while at the forefront of innovation, also needs to address critical social issues surrounding equality and inclusion, ensuring that hiring practices reflect a true commitment to diversity rather than just tokenism.",-18.0,3.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,669.0,0.14285714285714285,0.004484304932735426

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Authorities are actively pursuing several leads in connection with the bombing incident that rocked Chelsea last Saturday, injuring 29 individuals. Thankfully, all those hurt in the explosion have since been discharged from medical facilities, but the investigation continues to take precedence as police seek answers regarding this heinous act.

In a significant development, a second pressure-cooker bomb was located in a Dumpster nearby, raising alarms about the potential for further attacks and deepening the urgency of the investigation. The discovery has prompted law enforcement agencies to intensify their scrutiny of the incident, looking for links and clues that may lead to the perpetrator.

Among the pivotal leads in this case, investigators have come across a hand-written letter containing Arabic script, which was found inside the bag with the second bomb. This development has fueled speculation about the motives behind the bombings and whether they were part of a larger agenda. The presence of this letter suggests that the attackers may have wanted to communicate a specific message, and investigators are working tirelessly to translate and interpret its contents.

Additionally, audiotapes from the 911 emergency line reveal that an unidentified male caller warned authorities of impending violence, ominously stating, ""There will be more."" This chilling message raises the stakes significantly, as it indicates a brazen intention to perpetuate fear and chaos within the community. Police are investigating the origin of this call to determine whether it holds any relevance to the admitted attacker or if it serves as a diversionary tactic.

Compounding the complexity of the case, a Tumblr page titled ""I’m the NY Bomber"" has emerged, claiming to act as the bombers' manifesto. This online declaration presents a disturbing window into the mindset of the attacker. The author, who remains anonymous, expresses vehement anger towards societal views regarding the LGBTQ+ community and various perceived social inequalities. The individual claims that the bombings were mere “tests” while making alarming proclamations about intentions for further violence.

The post highlights a troubling intersection of social grievances with violent extremism—suggesting that the motivations behind such violent acts often intertwine with broader societal frustrations and issues. It remains unclear how much weight can be placed on statements made through social media, but the outcry for both accountability and understanding is developing.

Interestingly, the author of the Tumblr post acknowledges that claiming responsibility for an attack without actually committing it is unethical. This admission raises questions about the authenticity of the claims made and adds another layer of complexity to the investigation. Authorities must now differentiate between genuine threats and statements intended to provoke fear or garner attention.

As the investigation unfolds, police continue to pursue these leads and appealing to the community for any additional information that might aid in identifying those responsible. The Chelsea bombing incident has not only shaken local residents but also sparked a wider conversation regarding security, social issues, and the mentality behind such acts of violence.

In an era where the line between protest and violence can often blur, the implications of the incidents in Chelsea are profound, raising questions that extend beyond law enforcement into the heart of societal discourse. The ongoing investigation serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance and community cooperation as authorities strive to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all citizens.",-25.0,-46.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,614.0,-2.0,-0.0749185667752443
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As the political landscape heats up, former President Donald Trump, who is currently 70 years old, has been tirelessly campaigning over the past several months. With a much-anticipated debate looming ahead against a highly skilled political opponent, the stakes are higher than ever. Recent developments, however, have raised concerns about Trump’s readiness for the challenge.

In a bid to ease the pressure and refocus his energy, Trump hosted a last-minute rally in Roanoke. The event was intended as a way for him to unwind and connect with supporters. However, amidst this frenetic campaign schedule, signs of strain have become apparent. Observers have noted a troubling level of confusion in Trump's recent communications, particularly highlighted in a tweet that has sparked widespread discussion.

In this tweet, Trump referenced three separate and seemingly unrelated issues: five deaths attributed to a Middle Eastern immigrant in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina. The disjointed nature of his statements has led some to speculate about Trump's mental clarity and fitness to participate in the high-stakes debate against Hillary Clinton.

Critics have voiced their apprehensions over Trump's mental state, suggesting that these indications of confusion could undermine his effectiveness on the debate stage, where clarity and focus are vital. As the date of the debate approaches, the implications of his condition may have further ramifications for his campaign.

Moreover, as Trump prepares to face a seasoned politician, the scrutiny around his mental acuity and ability to articulate his policies effectively looms large. Will he be able to rise to the occasion and demonstrate the competence required to counter a strong opponent?

As Trump's team continues to push forward with their campaign efforts, the upcoming debate will not only serve as a platform for both candidates to present their visions but will also be a crucial moment for voters to assess their readiness and capabilities. The public will be watching closely to see if Trump can overcome his current challenges and stand strong in the face of significant political pressure.",-22.0,5.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,395.0,0.3333333333333333,0.012658227848101266

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474291954000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-HZMqIkGoU,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton.

In a disappointing turn of events for Hillary Clinton's campaign, a scheduled door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, on Tuesday afternoon attracted only a single attendee. The event, intended to galvanize volunteers and bolster grassroots support, took place at 1 PM but drew the attention of only one individual – a supporter of her rival, Donald Trump. 

The solitary attendee arrived eager to document the proceedings, capturing the stark reality of a deserted campaign effort. As Clinton’s staff navigated the silence of the event, the Trump supporter recorded the empty space filled only by Clinton’s organized staff and promotional materials. They would later be asked to leave, highlighting the ongoing tension between the two political camps in a highly charged election season.

On the surface, the Clinton campaign's headquarters appeared impeccably prepared for the event, suggesting that there were high hopes for a significant turnout. With appropriate materials, wares, and staff on hand, the atmosphere initially seemed poised for a vibrant gathering of motivated volunteers eager to support Clinton's candidacy. However, as the clock ticked on with no additional attendees joining, the discrepancy between expectation and reality became glaringly apparent. 

The lack of attendance at such a strategically planned event raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of Clinton’s campaign in Ohio and potentially in other critical states ahead of the election. Campaigns rely heavily on grassroots engagement to build momentum, and the empty turnout served as a stark indicator that Clinton may be struggling to inspire enthusiasm among her base. 

This dismal showing stands in sharp contrast to the packed rallies that Donald Trump has been enjoying across the nation. The significant gap in supporter turnout lends credence to growing speculation about the viability of Clinton's campaign as she moves through the election cycle. Many observers are noting that the palpable energy and excitement around Trump's events underscore a potential lack of enthusiasm for Clinton, marking a troubling sign as she prepares for the battles ahead.

Moreover, Clinton's campaign has been mired in various controversies that could pose additional challenges going forward. The implications of these issues seem to already be affecting her support levels, as evidenced by the lack of turnout in Delaware. As the campaign progresses, the sustained absence of a robust volunteer base and the reluctance of supporters to engage ground-level efforts may signal mounting difficulties for Clinton.

This door-knocking event in Delaware encapsulates a moment of uncertainty for Clinton's campaign, leaving analysts and supporters alike questioning the path forward. With other states looming on the horizon, the absence of a strong response to this failed event highlights the pressing need for the campaign to recalibrate its strategies and energize its base.

Ultimately, Clinton’s campaign must contend with the realities of public perception and the dynamic landscape of voter support. The empty chairs of this event in Ohio serve as a stark reminder that, while political campaigns often aim to connect with voters, they sometimes encounter unexpected challenges that can fundamentally alter the trajectory of their objectives. As the race heats up, only time will tell if these events will resonate as turning points for Clinton’s campaign or if they will fade as mere footnotes in a broader narrative of political ambition.",-7.0,14.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,616.0,0.6666666666666666,0.022727272727272728

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a devastating bombing in New York City, reactions have poured in from various political figures, most notably Donald Trump, who wasted no time in labeling the incident as a “bombing.” This choice of words mirrored that of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who also referred to the attack in similar terms.

The situation quickly escalated as media outlets, particularly CNN, began to scrutinize Trump’s response. Critics within the network were quick to call out what they perceived as his insensitivity in addressing the tragedy. Notably, during CNN's coverage, Clinton was shown acknowledging Trump’s comments, agreeing that he was indeed being “insensitive.” However, in a move that sparked outrage, CNN later edited their coverage, choosing to omit Clinton's expression of agreement, which many saw as an attempt to shift the narrative solely onto Trump.

On the show “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” Trump’s comments were met with further criticism. Tapper reinforced CNN’s negative portrayal of the former president’s remarks but failed to mention Clinton's equivalent language regarding the bombing. This sparked a flurry of discussion regarding media bias and the selective editing of news coverage.

In response to the ongoing criticisms, Trump appeared on “Fox and Friends,” where he did not hold back his disdain for CNN, calling the network “disgusting and disgraceful.” He reiterated that his assessment of the incident was accurate and pointedly labeled CNN as “the Clinton news network,” suggesting a collusion between the media outlet and Clinton’s political agenda.

Moreover, Trump seized the opportunity to discuss broader issues of terrorism and immigration, claiming that U.S. leaders have been “weak” in their approach to these matters. He asserted that it is imperative to enact stricter immigration policies to ensure national security. This aligns with his previous comments regarding President Obama’s plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees into the United States, which he vehemently criticized, warning against a lack of proper vetting for these individuals.

Trump's remarks extended to accusations directed at Hillary Clinton, asserting that she seeks to significantly increase the number of refugees accepted into the country. This provoked backlash from Clinton supporters who argue that Trump’s approach to the issue lacks compassion and ignores the humanitarian needs of those fleeing violence.

Such discussions in the political arena come at a time of heightened concern over national security, as Americans grapple with the implications of terrorism on their daily lives. The NYC bombing marks another chapter in the ongoing dialogue surrounding safety and immigration policies in the United States.

As the political landscape becomes increasingly polarized, the responses to the bombing serve as a reminder of the sharp divisions between various political factions. With Trump and Clinton both highlighting different aspects of the incident, it remains to be seen how public opinion will shape the narrative moving forward.

In the aftermath of the attack, the urgency for dialogue around terrorism and refugee policies appears more pressing than ever. Politicians, media outlets, and citizens alike continue to navigate a complex landscape where personal beliefs and the pursuit of security often clash.

Reactions to the NYC bombing will undoubtedly continue to evolve as new developments unfold and as political figures weigh in on the conversation. With each statement being carefully scrutinized, it is clear that both the incident itself and the surrounding political discourse will take center stage in the days to come, leaving many to wonder how this will impact upcoming policy debates.",-45.0,-31.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,667.0,-1.4761904761904763,-0.046476761619190406

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

In a significant legal development, Ahmad Rahami, a suspect linked to bombings in the Tri-state area, has initiated a lawsuit against local police, alleging a pattern of discrimination and harassment directed towards his family due to their Afghan heritage and Muslim faith. The lawsuit, filed recently in federal court in Newark, takes aim at what Rahami describes as unjust actions by law enforcement and local officials that negatively impacted their family-owned chicken restaurant, which has been operating since 2002.

The Rahami family asserts that their establishment has been the target of systematic attempts to force its closure, notably facing pressure from local officials to shutter its doors by 10 PM, despite having the appropriate permits to remain open later. The family claims that such actions were not only baseless but indicative of a broader pattern of targeted harassment, which they contend began around 2009 and continued until 2011. 

Rahami alleges that during this time, his family received numerous unjustified tickets and court summons, reflecting a ""reckless disregard"" for their constitutional rights. The lawsuit also highlights a disturbing trend of racial abuse aimed at the family, which they assert included derogatory comments, such as “Muslims don’t belong here.”

Additionally, the lawsuit notes that the Elizabeth Police Department cited local crime rates as justification for their aggressive tactics against the restaurant. The family views this rationale as an excuse to engage in discriminatory practices that disproportionately affected them and their livelihood.

With the filing of the lawsuit, Rahami and his family seek to address what they describe as a history of persecution rooted in their cultural background. They believe that the treatment they endured exemplifies a broader societal issue of discrimination faced by many individuals within their community, particularly following the events of September 11 and subsequent events that have heightened scrutiny on Muslim Americans.

Ironically, the legal battle for their rights transpired in the backdrop of Rahami’s eventual arrest five years later, when he was implicated in bomb-related activities. This twist has drawn attention to the complexities of his case, emphasizing both the individual and systemic challenges faced by minority communities.

Rahami's lawsuit raises critical questions about the balance between law enforcement efforts to maintain public safety and the protection of the constitutional rights of individuals from marginalized backgrounds. As the case unfolds, it is poised to spark discussions surrounding civil rights, discrimination, and the treatment of minority communities by law enforcement agencies in the United States. 

The legal proceedings will undoubtedly bring further scrutiny to the practices of the Elizabeth Police Department and could serve as a case study on the intersection of law enforcement and community relations. The Rahami family’s pursuit of justice continues, as they seek accountability for the experiences they claim have profoundly impacted their lives and business.",-49.0,-39.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,525.0,-2.6,-0.07428571428571429
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have surfaced regarding potential pay-to-play corruption tied to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. Critics claim that donors to the foundation received undue political access, raising questions about the ethical implications of the organization's operations.

In light of these accusations, the Clinton campaign has emphasized the foundation's positive contributions, arguing that its work has significantly benefited numerous charitable efforts globally. However, detractors assert that the foundation functions primarily as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates, with the appearance of a charitable organization maintained for legitimacy.

Financial scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation reveals troubling statistics in terms of its charitable activities. According to IRS filings from 2014, a mere 5.7% of the foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants. The total expenditures for the foundation that year amounted to nearly $91.3 million, of which less than $5.2 million was directly channeled into grants for charitable purposes. This figure has raised eyebrows among watchdogs who argue that a non-profit organization should prioritize fund allocation to charitable endeavors.

Moreover, the financial breakdown for 2014 shows that the foundation spent $34.8 million on salaries and employee benefits, constituting a substantial portion of its budget. An additional $50.4 million was spent on ""other expenses,"" highlighting a concerning trend of increased operational costs amidst growing allocations for salaries and benefits. These expenses came even as charitable spending declined by 40% compared to the previous year, despite the foundation receiving an additional $30 million in funding.

Critics have pointed to these trends as indicative of a potential financial model that favors personal gains over philanthropic impact. There are assertions that the foundation may primarily serve the interests of the Clintons and their allies, with the charitable aspect acting as a façade to provide an image of legitimacy while facilitating significant income generation through political channels.

As scrutiny intensifies surrounding the financial practices of the Clinton Foundation, calls for greater transparency and accountability grow louder. The apparent imbalance between funds raised and the actual distribution to charitable initiatives raises significant ethical questions regarding the organization's overall purpose and the motivations behind its operations. 

The allegations reflect broader concerns about political influence and the intertwining of philanthropic efforts with personal gain, setting the stage for ongoing debate about the foundation's role amid the Clinton family's public life.",25.0,29.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,441.0,1.8125,0.06575963718820861

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

Former President Barack Obama delivered a speech in New York City following a series of violent incidents in the area, which included bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with a stabbing incident in Minnesota. Anticipation ran high among attendees and the general public, as many expected Obama to pay tribute to the victims and their families, expressing solidarity during a time of community distress.

However, in a surprising turn of events, Obama chose to sidestep any mention of the bombings and the injuries they caused, opting instead to attend a high-dollar fundraising event. His decision left many bewildered, as the expectation was not just for a traditional campaign speech, but for a moment of unity in the aftermath of violence that affected innocent lives.

In what became a contentious part of the evening, Obama's address concentrated heavily on themes of ""sexism,"" asserting that the current media landscape, specifically citing Rush Limbaugh and Fox News, was responsible for the challenges faced by Hillary Clinton in her campaign. The former president devoted a significant portion of his speech to these accusations, seemingly drawing a direct line between media rhetoric and political struggles.

Moreover, Obama took the opportunity to criticize Donald Trump, an act familiar in his post-presidential engagements. He lauded Clinton while weaving a narrative that placed significant blame on external factors for her campaign's difficulties, highlighting issues that he believes feminist movements still grapple with amidst this political climate.

However, as the spotlight turned back to the immediate concerns in the nation, Obama’s choice to completely omit references to the bombings and the victims left many feeling unheard. Critics were quick to express their outrage, emphasizing that acknowledgment of such tragic events is crucial, especially during a public address in close proximity to where they occurred.

Responses on social media and among political commentators painted a picture of discontent, with many noting that a brief statement expressing condolences and support for the injured could have provided a much-needed sense of solidarity and comfort. Critics argued that the juxtaposition of acknowledging LGBTQ+ issues and discussing the challenges faced by women in politics while ignoring recent acts of violence was out of touch and disrespectful to those affected by the attacks.

As the speech faded into discussions of the upcoming election and the state of political discourse, the absence of empathy regarding the bombings and their repercussions became a focal point. The decision to highlight issues concerning media influence over a moment of public mourning invited questions about priorities and leadership in times of national crisis.

In light of these events, the former president's decision to prioritize fundraising over acknowledgment of violence in the nation has sparked a conversation not only about the responsibilities of leaders during turbulent times but also about the efficacy and empathy expected from public figures. As many continued to process the aftermath of the bombings and the stabbing incident, the demand for compassion and recognition of shared humanity remained high.

In summary, Obama's speech left more questions than answers for many New Yorkers who sought a moment of reflection and unity in light of recent violence, as he instead focused on political narratives that many felt should not overshadow the mourning of victims and the healing of a community.",-25.0,-37.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,612.0,-2.176470588235294,-0.06045751633986928
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

As public awareness of corruption within the Clinton Foundation has grown since Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, a shocking new report reveals that the organization may be facing issues more severe than previously understood. The findings specifically focus on the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), which has drawn scrutiny for allegedly distributing “watered-down” HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa.

According to a draft congressional report, this troubling practice “likely increased” morbidity and mortality risks for countless individuals relying on these medications. CHAI has been viewed as one of the foundation’s most critical and esteemed initiatives aimed at supporting AIDS victims, making the allegations particularly alarming.

As these revelations come to light, the report posits that renewed scrutiny of the Clinton charity is likely, coinciding with the backdrop of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Compounding the controversy, the investigation delves into connections between Bill Clinton and certain controversial Indian-Americans affiliated with the pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy, a company that has previously faced investigations by the FDA and SEC for serious regulatory violations.

The Clinton Foundation has faced allegations of promoting Ranbaxy’s products despite documented evidence of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting practices. These claims raise pressing questions about the ethical implications of the foundation's operations and the potential risks posed to vulnerable populations in need of effective treatment.

While the precise number of AIDS patients who may have received the alleged diluted drugs remains uncertain, the report emphasizes the urgency of addressing these issues. It calls for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further harm to those who depend on its services.

As the situation develops, the implications of these findings could resonate not only in the realm of public health but also within the political landscape as scrutiny over the foundation and its initiatives escalates.",-14.0,-26.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,349.0,-2.3636363636363638,-0.07449856733524356
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?",http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,Mockarena Cotr,http://www.chicksontheright.com,{'$date': 1474332562000},,"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2fb62ae885c1cdb2a0c69249a9c25a?s=120&d=mm&r=g,http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN#!,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cotrolog-smalll.png,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CotR_banner1-copy-2.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8W3QtpyKy7xuZ.gif,http://rightchicks.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/book-thumb.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49-812x478.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kardashian-jenner-424x250.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d1x2X8_nNBHjc.gif",https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/,"{""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Chicks On The Right"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 812, ""identifier"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""height"": 550}, ""url"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""image"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""card"": ""summary"", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right""}, ""robots"": ""noodp"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/"", ""section"": ""Constitution"", ""tag"": ""felony"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-19T20:49:22-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- Arizona state legislature criticized for poor bill wording, leading to unintentional criminalization of normal parenting activities.

The recent passing of a law by the Arizona state legislature has ignited significant controversy, with critics asserting that the poorly worded legislation could inadvertently criminalize normal parental activities. Advocates for child protection intended the law to safeguard minors from molestation, yet it has raised serious concerns about its implications for innocent parenting.

The law strictly criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals. As a result, everyday activities such as diaper changes and baths could potentially expose parents and caregivers to legal repercussions. The vagueness of the legislation has left many unsettled, as it fails to adequately distinguish between innocent parental actions and malicious intent. 

Supporters of the law argue it is crucial for offering protection to children against predatory behaviors. However, critics contend that it has created a precarious legal landscape for parents, who may now find themselves subjected to legal scrutiny over benign interactions with their children. The Arizona Supreme Court, while backing the law, has reassured the public that prosecutors are unlikely to pursue charges against innocent parents. This assertion, however, has done little to alleviate the fears stemming from the law's ambiguous phrasing.

In a troubling development, the ruling has shifted the burden of proof, requiring defendants to demonstrate a lack of sexual intent if accused under this law. Such a shift undermines a fundamental principle of justice: the presumption of innocence, which is crucial in protecting citizens from wrongful accusations. This requirement can place an undue burden on parents who must now navigate a legal landscape designed without clear parameters distinguishing between care and criminality.

Other concerns are brewing around the potential coercion associated with plea bargaining under these regulations. Legal experts have warned that prosecutors may pressure parents into accepting guilty pleas for lesser charges, even when those parents have not engaged in any wrongdoing. Fordham law professors have expressed that this law might easily transform into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, enabling overreach into the private lives of families with little justification.

The implications of this legislation extend far beyond legal ramifications; many argue that it jeopardizes constitutional rights and establishes a troubling precedent for the treatment of parents and caregivers in Arizona. In a climate where innocent actions can be misconstrued as crimes, the law raises serious questions about children's welfare and parental rights.

Furthermore, skepticism persists regarding the government's ability to rectify any unintended consequences that may arise from the law's enforcement. Many citizens are left wondering if the risk of wrongful accusations will deter parental involvement in essential caregiving tasks. 

As Arizona grapples with the fallout from this legislation, the need for clearer, more effective laws that protect children without undermining the rights of parents has become increasingly evident. Advocates for children’s rights, legal experts, and parents alike are calling for a reevaluation of the law’s language to prevent the criminalization of innocent care, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that ensures safety while respecting fundamental parental rights.",-12.0,-40.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,562.0,-1.9047619047619047,-0.0711743772241993

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts with the possibility of a Hillary Clinton administration, concerns have arisen about the looming presence of the Obamas in the public eye. Anticipation mixed with apprehension is palpable among some political analysts and constituents who worry about the narrative and impact of ongoing coverage of Barack and Michelle Obama under a potentially renewed Democratic leadership.

Among the critiques that have surfaced, Michelle Obama’s legacy stands at the forefront. While she is often celebrated for her contributions, her initiatives, most notably the school lunch program, have faced significant scrutiny. Critics argue that the program, aimed at combating childhood obesity, has encountered practical challenges that may undermine its effectiveness. In addition, some of her statements during public appearances have been deemed controversial, leading to further questioning of her leadership during her time as First Lady.

Adding to the discourse is the speculation regarding a potential role for Michelle Obama in a future Clinton administration. The question of her qualifications has become a focal point of debate, with some observers expressing doubt about her readiness to take on a prominent governmental position. While her popularity remains high, her previous experience in political roles and governance raises critical eyebrows within political circles.

Hillary Clinton’s own views on child upbringing contribute to the ongoing discussion. Known for her belief in the necessity of government involvement in this sphere, Clinton’s policies could intersect with those championed by Michelle Obama. However, this perspective incites a broader discourse about the implications of such governance. Many citizens voice concerns about the ramifications of increased governmental control over education and child-rearing, fearing that it may represent an overreach of authority.

Michelle Obama remains steadfast in her commitment to health initiatives for children, promising to extend her campaigns indefinitely regardless of the political climate. Her determination to inspire change in children’s health extends beyond her tenure as First Lady, yet it pushes some critics to question the effectiveness of perpetually government-backed programs. They argue that without robust community involvement and adequate resources, the health campaigns may struggle in achieving their intended outcomes.

Amid these complexities, there is speculation that Clinton’s potential endorsement of Michelle Obama may serve as a strategic attempt to capture the affections of voters who admire the Obamas. Despite their reservations about Clinton herself, many individuals retain a favorable view of the former presidential couple. This reliance on the Obamas’ goodwill could be a calculated move, aimed at bridging the gap between differing voter sentiments.

However, warnings about the dangers posed by increased government involvement in personal spheres echo through these discussions. Critics contend that such an approach could hinder personal freedoms and lead to unintended consequences in the realms of education and family life. The idea of government dictating parenting norms raises fundamental inquiries into civil liberties and announces a move toward a more interventionist state.

As the dialogue around a potential Clinton administration continues, the implications of the Obamas’ presence and influence linger in the minds of the electorate. The critiques of Michelle Obama’s legacy, the questions surrounding her qualifications, and concerns about government involvement in child-rearing underscore the nuanced and often contentious nature of political alliances. 

As voters ponder their choices moving forward, the interplay between the Obamas and a possible Clinton presidency will undoubtedly remain a pivotal topic in the national discourse, shaping perceptions of leadership, governance, and the future of American political dynamics.",6.0,21.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,647.0,0.84,0.03245749613601236

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A scandal has emerged surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), sparking concerns over the distribution of what have been described as ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa. Allegations suggest that this distribution may have contributed to numerous preventable deaths, raising questions about the initiative's oversight and efficacy.

At the center of this controversy is an Indian drug manufacturer, Ranbaxy, which has faced scrutiny for its role in supplying these substandard drugs. The central question now is whether former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were aware of these troubling practices during their partnership with Ranbaxy.

Ranbaxy, which became infamous for its questionable practices, was found guilty in 2013 of fraud, introducing adulterated drugs into the commercial market. The company faced a hefty $500 million penalty following a case that unveiled its misdeeds. Despite this damning history, the relationship between CHAI and Ranbaxy reportedly continued, compounding concerns regarding patient safety and the ethical implications of such ties.

Details of this scandal are brought to light in a draft congressional report titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" spearheaded by Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn. The report delves into the intricate relationship between CHAI and Ranbaxy, emphasizing the crucial role played by whistleblower Dinesh Thakur. His revelations were pivotal in facilitating a U.S. lawsuit against the drug company, illustrating the weight of insider testimony in combating corporate malfeasance.

In her inquiry, Blackburn has raised profoundly troubling questions regarding the number of lives potentially lost due to the distribution of these substandard drugs by Ranbaxy as part of the CHAI initiative. The implications of this scandal are far-reaching, hinting at not only regulatory failures but also a dire humanitarian impact on communities that relied heavily on these medications.

The situation has prompted renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation as allegations surface regarding its ties with individuals who have been investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite undeniable quality control issues at Ranbaxy, which are reflected in its long history of criminal and civil violations, CHAI's associations with the company persist without clear distance or separation.

A report by ProPublica has shed additional light on this matter, revealing significant U.S. financial aid directed towards Ranbaxy, thereby raising flags about the quality of the medications produced and the possible harm posed to patients. This financial support conjures troubling questions about the efficacy of regulatory oversight and the safety of the drugs that are reaching some of the most vulnerable populations in need.

These revelations complicate the narrative around the humanitarian efforts led by the Clintons and CHAI. While the initiative purports to work towards improving healthcare access in resource-constrained environments, the allegations of prioritizing profit over patient welfare depict a starkly different reality. Many contend that marginalized communities suffering from HIV/AIDS rely on these medications for their survival, and substandard treatments can have devastating repercussions.

Despite Ranbaxy's drugs being banned from U.S. markets, the company's products continue to be sold globally, raising serious concerns about the ongoing risk to patients overseas. The lack of a clear denouncement from the Clinton Foundation regarding its affiliation with the manufacturer further intensifies criticism directed towards its operations.

Potentially viewing the Clintons through a lens of profit-driven motives rather than altruism, critics assert that the fallout of this scandal reverberates beyond just financial implications. It raises ethical questions about the commitments made to marginalized communities and whether the intentions of initiatives like CHAI are genuinely rooted in the desire to provide care or if they are rather motivated by financial incentives.

As the congressional report unfolds and the implications of the scandal are explored, there is a growing call for accountability and transparency within the Clinton Foundation and its associated initiatives. The public deserves to understand the decisions made and the rationale behind partnering with companies like Ranbaxy, especially in light of their troubling past.

These developments underscore the urgent need for vigilance with respect to pharmaceutical distribution, especially in areas where healthcare infrastructure is limited. As sub-Saharan Africa grapples with the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS, it is imperative that health initiatives prioritize patient safety and drug efficacy to prevent unnecessary loss of life.

In conclusion, the unfolding scandal has the potential to challenge perceptions of the Clinton Health Access Initiative and the broader mission of the Clinton Foundation. It serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities and moral responsibilities entailed in striving for health equity in a world where profit margins can sometimes overshadow the very lives that initiatives aim to improve. As investigations continue, the stakes are high not just for the Clintons but for the countless individuals who depend on effective and safe medical treatment.",-63.0,-51.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,877.0,-1.7,-0.05815279361459521

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated the State Department to disclose documents concerning the security training completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her senior aides within five days. This order arises as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit initiated by The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which is seeking records pertaining to security training recommendations for Clinton and her team.

Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, rejected a motion from the State Department that sought to dismiss the lawsuit. Despite this victory for TheDCNF, the judge denied a request to depose State Department officials, a move that could have potentially unveiled more context surrounding the security protocols followed by Clinton and her aides.

The State Department, as of now, has not clarified whether Clinton and her senior staff completed the necessary mandatory security briefings regarding the handling of classified materials. This lack of confirmation raises important questions about compliance with federal security requirements, especially for individuals in high-ranking government positions.

Judge Leon has expressed his frustration over the State Department’s delays in producing the requested documents. To facilitate the process, he has established clear deadlines: one-third of the requested documents must be released by September 26, with the remaining records due by October 10. The judge’s insistence on these deadlines highlights increasing tensions around transparency and accountability in government operations.

According to officials within the State Department, the failure to produce the needed documentation may suggest that the required security courses were not completed by Clinton and her aides. This assertion raises significant concerns about the safeguarding of classified materials during Clinton's tenure and the extent of training provided to her team.

Bradley Moss, an attorney representing TheDCNF, commented on the implications of the judge's order, indicating that it reflects a broader frustration with the State Department's perceived obstruction of the FOIA process. Moss's remarks emphasize the judicial system's role in enforcing transparency regulations and the critical importance of accountability among public officials.

As the situation unfolds, the implications of this ruling could resonate beyond the immediate details of the case, potentially influencing future government protocols surrounding classified information and security training. The expectation is that with the deadlines set by Judge Leon, further developments are likely to emerge shortly, illuminating the conduct of Clinton and her aides regarding mandatory security training during a pivotal time in American politics.

The ruling is also a reminder of the ongoing scrutiny and public interest surrounding government officials and their handling of classified information. The outcome of this case may set precedents for how future FOIA requests are processed and what information is deemed necessary for public knowledge. 

Judge Leon's determination to expedite the release of the documents reflects an increasing commitment within the judiciary to ensure that government agencies adhere to transparency laws and fulfill their obligations under FOIA requests. This case serves as a significant test for the State Department’s approach to handling requests for information related to former officials and may highlight broader systemic issues within the agency.

As deadlines approach, the focus will be on the State Department's compliance with the court's order and the potential revelations that may arise from the documents. With the political climate continually evolving, the outcome is likely to attract widespread attention from both the public and the media, further reinforcing the importance of transparency in government affairs. 

The ramifications of this ruling will not only impact the individuals involved but may also have lasting effects on public trust in government institutions tasked with managing sensitive information and maintaining national security protocols. The unfolding of this case, particularly with the specific timelines mandated by the court, could serve as a pivotal moment in the broader dialogue about accountability in government.",-5.0,6.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,706.0,0.2608695652173913,0.0084985835694051
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the nation gears up for the highly anticipated first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, all eyes will be on Lester Holt, who has been named as the debate moderator. While Holt's role is crucial in guiding the discussion, NBC News has hinted that he will not be employing on-screen fact-checking during the event, raising concerns about a landscape where Trump may be allowed to make unverified claims without immediate accountability.

This decision is echoed across various cable news networks, which have chosen to steer clear of live fact-checking during the debate. Consequently, the burden of ensuring that candidates remain truthful may fall primarily on Holt's shoulders. This scenario is particularly worrisome when considering that Trump is documented to lie, on average, every three-and-a-half minutes. The absence of a robust fact-checking mechanism could allow the former president to present misleading information without challenge during the debate.

Jennifer Palmieri, Communications Director for the Clinton campaign, has emphasized the importance of the moderator's role in questioning and challenging falsehoods articulated by the candidates. The expectation rests heavily on Clinton to deliver a strong performance that would not only convince voters but also ""win"" against Trump's often unfiltered rhetoric. 

This debate setup has sparked conversations about a perceived double standard in the treatment of the two candidates. Observers note that Clinton appears under greater scrutiny, needing to articulate her points clearly and convincingly in order to emerge triumphant in the eyes of the electorate and the media. In contrast, some feel that Trump's approach allows for leeway in how his statements are received and interpreted.

Concerns also arise regarding the potential implications of this dynamic for public perception. Without effective fact-checking in place, there is a tangible fear that viewers might struggle to discern the merits of Clinton's arguments, ultimately clouding their understanding of her success in the debate. The stakes are extraordinarily high, and the absence of rigorous journalism standards may further complicate the issue of how information is assessed by the public.

As the debate approaches, many are left wondering whether the current state of media practices adequately supports an informed electorate during this critical election season. The interplay of unchecked claims, heightened scrutiny, and journalistic integrity forms a complex backdrop for what promises to be a defining moment in the 2016 presidential race.",-6.0,23.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,444.0,1.4375,0.0518018018018018
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

Dolly Kyle, a former associate of Bill Clinton and author of the controversial book “Hillary the Other Woman,” has voiced significant concerns about Hillary Clinton's readiness for the presidency. In a recent commentary, Kyle outlines a troubling assessment of Clinton’s mental and physical health, suggesting that these factors could have serious implications for her candidacy.

Kyle characterizes Clinton as ""angry and driven by rage,"" warning that these intense emotions could lead to a potential breakdown. The rhetoric surrounding Clinton has been scrutinized for years, but Kyle's remarks introduce a personal perspective from someone who once counted Clinton among her close associates. She asserts that a candidate's mental state can crucially influence their capacity to lead, and she believes Clinton's current demeanor raises red flags.

According to Kyle, Clinton exhibits signs of cognitive impairment and emotional instability, which raise further questions about her capability to handle the pressures of the presidency. ""Memory loss and difficulty completing tasks,"" she claims, are symptomatic of deeper issues that could hinder Clinton's performance as a leader. These assertions paint a picture of an individual grappling with significant challenges that could impede her ability to govern effectively.

Moreover, Kyle expresses grave concerns over what she perceives as Clinton’s paranoia and intense desire for control. These traits, she argues, are particularly troubling for someone aiming to occupy the highest office in the land. In politically charged environments, the capacity for clear judgment is essential, and Kyle believes that Clinton's state of mind could compromise this necessity.

Kyle’s commentary emphasizes her belief that Clinton's ""addiction to power"" drives her relentless ambition. This quest for control, according to Kyle, may not only jeopardize Clinton's personal health but also adversely affect the Democratic Party as a whole. In a landscape already fraught with political division and contention, leadership qualities are under intense examination; thus, Kyle's insights resonate amidst ongoing discussions about Clinton's candidacy.

The criticism directed at Hillary Clinton is not new, but Kyle’s perspective adds a deeply personal layer to the ongoing scrutiny concerning Clinton’s health, character, and leadership abilities. As the political landscape evolves, questions regarding the fitness of candidates like Clinton will continue to fuel debates, shaping public perception and the future of political discourse.",-13.0,-9.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,452.0,-0.5625,-0.01991150442477876

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

In a time when many nations grapple with the challenges posed by immigration, the United States stands at a crucial crossroads. Leaders are calling for a renewed emphasis on national unity and a cohesive approach to immigration that prioritizes the integration of newcomers into the fabric of American society. This approach advocates that immigrants should adapt to American customs and lifestyles rather than holding on to their own cultural practices, ensuring harmony within communities.

The dialogue around immigrant integration has gained further depth through recent comments made by a mayor from Quebec, who highlighted similar sentiments about the need for immigrants, particularly Muslims, to embrace Canadian culture. He argued that immigrants should not expect the host nation to change its cultural identity for their benefit. This assertion reflects a growing perspective that values the preservation of national identity against the backdrop of multiculturalism.

In his remarks, the mayor underscored Canada’s unique position as a welcoming nation that accepts immigrants from diverse backgrounds. He drew a contrast between Canadian openness and the restrictive practices observed in many Muslim-majority countries, where the acceptance of non-Muslims is often limited. This comparison serves to reinforce the argument that immigrants to Canada—and by extension, to other nations such as the United States—should actively seek to integrate themselves into the prevailing societal norms instead of expecting those norms to shift to accommodate their beliefs.

Central to this discussion is the importance of preserving the Canadian identity, which the mayor asserted is deeply rooted in Judeo-Christian traditions. He contended that maintaining this cultural foundation is vital for national cohesion. As part of this commitment to national identity, the municipality of Dorval has asserted its right to refuse concessions to Islamic practices and Sharia law, thereby striving to prevent external influences from altering local governance and societal norms.

The political landscape in the United States mirrors these sentiments. Legislation is being prepared in Texas aimed explicitly at preventing the introduction of Sharia law within American courts. This proactive measure underlines a growing concern among some lawmakers about the potential for parallel legal systems to emerge, which could threaten the fundamental principles upon which the United States was built.

The mayor’s comments resonate strongly with a broader call for immigrants to either wholeheartedly embrace the culture of their new country or refrain from imposing their beliefs upon others. This perspective emphasizes that immigrants hold a responsibility to assimilate into the social and cultural fabric of America, thereby enhancing the collective experience while fostering respect and understanding among varying cultural identities.

Moreover, for those individuals who find themselves uncomfortable with the prevailing Canadian or American culture, traditional suggestions have emerged—such as considering a return to their countries of origin.

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In an unsettling incident in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through the area. The gathering raised immediate concerns from onlookers and local residents about the potential for an altercation or possible mugging, drawing parallels to other incidents that have generated safety worries in similar protest situations.

Instead of succumbing to fear or panic in the face of the hostile crowd, the driver took a different approach. Demonstrating a sense of composure, he rolled down his window, revealing that he was armed. The sight of a handgun in this tense environment led to a rapid dispersal of the protesters, who quickly retreated from the vehicle.

This incident has sparked a complex and heated discussion regarding the appropriateness of the man's actions during the confrontation. Some argue that wielding a firearm in a situation involving protests could exacerbate tensions and contribute to an escalating cycle of violence. Critics of the driver’s choice suggest that he could have considered alternative responses, such as driving through the gathering rather than engaging directly with the protesters.

Supporters, however, defend the man's right to protect himself, pointing out that it is natural for individuals to want to maintain safety when faced with an intimidating crowd. They argue that the decision to display a firearm effectively defused a potentially dangerous situation and prevented further escalation.

The discourse surrounding this incident reflects broader societal debates on the intersections of race, safety, and the right to bear arms. Questions have arisen about how individuals should navigate encounters with organized groups, particularly when tensions are high. As this unsettling moment continues to be analyzed, it raises pertinent points on personal safety, the role of self-defense, and the protocols individuals should follow in volatile situations.

As communities continue to address these critical issues, the incident underscores the need for dialogue around respectful engagement and understanding during protests and counter-protests. The atmosphere remains charged, highlighting the complex landscape in which social justice movements and individual rights intersect.",-18.0,-31.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,390.0,-2.066666666666667,-0.07948717948717948

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago environmentalists are facing criticism for what many perceive as hypocrisy in their stance on local development projects. Recently, the group that successfully blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum in the city has now thrown its support behind the construction of the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. This shift has sparked accusations of inconsistency among community members and activists alike.

The opposition to Lucas's museum was rooted in environmental concerns, with advocates citing the project's potential impact on the area. However, supporters of the Obama center, including Juanita Irizarry, the director of Friends of the Parks, have expressed enthusiasm about its construction. Irizarry's excitement has drawn sharp contrasts to the group’s previous actions against the Lucas project, which was proposed to be built on an existing parking lot.

The upcoming Obama center’s construction is set to involve significant alterations to Jackson Park, including the bulldozing of trees and grass, prompting further questions about the group's environmental priorities. Critics argue that this apparent double standard highlights underlying issues of political hypocrisy and raises concerns about race. The juxtaposition of the two projects has led to discussions regarding the motivations behind the environmentalists' priorities and the implications for local communities.

As the debate continues, many are left wondering how environmental groups will reconcile their positions and address the community's concerns regarding consistency and accountability in their advocacy. The contrasting stances taken by Friends of the Parks may serve as a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding development and environmental stewardship in Chicago.",3.0,3.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,297.0,0.2727272727272727,0.010101010101010102

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

General Stanley McChrystal, the former Commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, has submitted his resignation following a contentious meeting with Commander-in-Chief Barack Obama. This pivotal moment marks a significant chapter in the complex relationship between military leadership and the presidency during the Afghan conflict.

Throughout his tenure, McChrystal frequently found himself at odds with Obama over the conduct of the war, leading to mounting tensions. The situation reached a boiling point when McChrystal was summoned to the Oval Office, a meeting he reportedly entered with the anticipation that it could mark the end of his Army career.

During this critical discussion, Obama accused McChrystal of failing to provide adequate political support. In response, McChrystal clarified that his allegiance lay not with a politician but with the responsibilities of his role as Commander-in-Chief. With conviction, he handed in his resignation, signaling his decision to step away from a leadership position fraught with discord.

In a moment reflecting the strained relationship between Obama and military leaders, the president aimed to retaliate with a remark about what McChrystal might think in his final moments. However, McChrystal, maintaining his composure, responded with a salute and a poignant comment regarding his future after leaving the Army—expressing a desire to avoid a lengthy waiting period, suggesting that he would wait respectfully in a different capacity.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm.

Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has become the focal point of national attention following reports that a significant majority of rioters involved in recent protests were not local residents. Eyewitness accounts and police statements reveal that at least 70% of those participating in the unrest were reportedly bussed in from out of state, raising questions about the motivations behind these demonstrations.

Authorities noted that many of the individuals arrested during the riots presented out-of-state identification. This has fueled suspicions of a well-coordinated and pre-planned operation aimed at instigating chaos rather than a genuine protest related to the Black Lives Matter movement. The leadership of the local police union did not mince words, describing the rioters as ""professional criminals"" whose intention was solely to sow discord.

Concerns are mounting that external radicals are deliberately inciting violence during these protests, which ostensibly center around social justice and police reform. This allegation has ignited a broader conversation on the infiltration of radical elements into peaceful movements. Comparatively, the nearby city of Tulsa faced similar concerns regarding outside influences but managed to maintain a more peaceful atmosphere amid its own protests. 

Authorities in Charlotte investigated the backgrounds of those arrested during the riots and found that the majority had no local ties to the city. This revelation underscores the extent to which these disturbances may have been orchestrated by individuals with unclear motives, further complicating the narrative surrounding the nation's ongoing dialogue about systemic racism and police misconduct.

Statements emerging from police departments in Charlotte have echoed sentiments that indicate a trend of unrest being driven by organized interests rather than spontaneous outcry. Many believe that the unrest in Charlotte reveals a broader agenda designed to create societal chaos, with some analysts drawing parallels to communism. Such claims suggest that the unrest is not solely rooted in grievances over police violence, but rather in a calculated effort to destabilize community relations.

The situations in Charlotte and Tulsa present stark contrasts, particularly when examining local sympathies toward the Black Lives Matter cause. In Tulsa, residents expressed their grievances peacefully, showcasing an ability to engage in dialogue without descending into violence. Additionally, legal actions regarding police conduct in Tulsa have evolved in ways that reflect community-led efforts toward reform, which may have mitigated potential unrest.

In Charlotte, however, the influx of out-of-state rioters, coupled with the characterization of participants as criminals by local police, has left many residents feeling unsettled. The perception of outside forces taking advantage of a local movement could alienate community members who are genuinely invested in enacting change and seeking justice for victims of police violence.

As discussions continue regarding the dynamics of the protests, many are calling for independent investigations into the sources and motives of those inciting violence. Local authorities are being pushed to assess their strategies in addressing both community concerns and the apparent influence of organized groups seeking to exploit the situation for their agendas.

The future of protests in Charlotte remains uncertain, as tensions between citizens, law enforcement, and perceived outside agitators linger. Community leaders are advocating for restorative measures that focus on healing and empowerment instead of chaos. In navigating this challenging climate, it becomes crucial to discern between genuine local grievances and external manipulation of the protests.

As the situation unfolds, Charlotte's experiences may serve as an important case study for other communities grappling with similar tensions. The focus now remains on ensuring that the core message of social justice is not lost amid the turmoil, and that voices for change can be heard clearly without being overshadowed by violence and disruption.",-17.0,-52.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,665.0,-2.08,-0.07819548872180451

He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:

The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”!

As the Presidential campaign heats up, Hillary Clinton’s health has emerged as a contentious issue. Claims of serious health problems, including potential neurological diseases, have stirred concern among voters and media alike. The dialogue around her health intensified after she collapsed on September 11th, a moment that many believe even pro-Hillary outlets cannot effectively downplay.

Adding fuel to the fire, expert Clif Hite has posited an unsettling theory suggesting that Clinton may have died, with the possibility of her being replaced by body doubles and CGI images. Should this theory hold any truth, it could signify a vast political coverup that raises profound questions about transparency in the election process.

Compounding the situation, Russian intelligence agencies have reportedly leveraged Hite’s video as a basis to assert that Clinton's public appearances are staged. In light of these claims, there are also assertions that Clinton has remained in her daughter Chelsea’s apartment, supposedly utilizing doubles to mask her absence.

Further complicating matters, discussions around emails have surfaced, hinting at Clinton's involvement in a secret plane crash that allegedly resulted in severe injuries. The credibility of this plane crash report is currently under debate, leaving many to ponder its validity.

As the campaign progresses, readers are urged to voice their opinions on the speculative theories surrounding Hillary Clinton’s health, including the possibility of her being injured or killed and subsequently replaced by CGI imagery.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right?

The political landscape in the United States continues to evolve with the emergence of various organizations focused on influencing elections and public opinion. Recent revelations from Discover the Networks have highlighted a group called Common Defense PAC, which is reportedly funded by George Soros and aims to oppose presidential candidates deemed contrary to their values, primarily targeting Donald Trump.

Common Defense PAC positions itself as an advocate for the rights of every American, yet it has become a vocal critic of Trump. The organization employs various strategies to disseminate its anti-Trump message, featuring a range of video advertisements designed to sway public opinion against the former president. Additionally, the PAC has partnered with MoveOn.org, utilizing their platform to share petitions aimed at rallying support against Trump. These efforts include promoting the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, further amplifying their campaign message through social media engagement.

The leadership of Common Defense PAC notably consists of military veterans, a fact that underscores their commitment to issues surrounding veterans' rights and support. However, an interesting detail is that the contact information for these veterans is not readily accessible, leading some critics to question the transparency and legitimacy of the organization. 

One of the most significant campaigns orchestrated by Common Defense PAC is the Thunderclap initiative, titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump. This campaign, featuring the PAC’s logo, reached a staggering audience of over 4.5 million people and garnered endorsements from well-known public figures, including actor Mark Ruffalo and political commentator Van Jones. Such high-profile support illustrates the reach and impact that this PAC aspires to achieve, especially among younger, more progressive voters.

In addition to online campaigns, Common Defense PAC has taken to the streets, collaborating with MoveOn.org to organize protests directed at Republican leaders such as John McCain. These protests have served as platforms to urge these leaders to publicly disavow Trump, further positioning the PAC as a player in the battle against Trump’s perceived influence in the GOP.

An intriguing aspect of Common Defense PAC is its financial backing. A recent filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) revealed a single donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000 to the PAC. This raises further questions regarding the financial support and sustainability of the organization, as reliance on a single donor may impact its ability to operate independently and represent the interests of a broader spectrum of veterans.

Perry O’Brien, the director of Common Defense PAC, comes with a background that includes experience as a left-wing activist and conscientious objector during the Iraq War. O'Brien has been instrumental in driving the organization’s mission, having previously initiated a MoveOn.org petition calling on GOP officials to disavow Trump and his controversial comments about veterans. His leadership has undoubtedly shaped the PAC’s direction; however, it also fosters skepticism regarding the authenticity of the organization’s representation of the veteran community at large.

The intersection of finances, leadership, and messaging in Common Defense PAC paints a complex picture. While the organization claims to stand for the rights and interests of veterans, the alignment with Soros funding and the absence of readily identifiable veteran voices raises questions about whose interests are genuinely being served. Critics of the PAC suggest that such affiliations may compromise the integrity of the veteran advocacy narrative.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the activities and influence of Common Defense PAC will likely continue to evolve. Whether the organization can transcend its financial constraints and leadership challenges to effectively represent the diverse opinions of veterans remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that its actions will be closely monitored by both supporters and detractors alike, as the political battle lines are drawn in anticipation of a contentious electoral season. 

In a landscape where media and messaging can sway public opinion, the stakes surrounding organizations like Common Defense PAC underscore the ongoing dialogue about representation, accountability, and the complexities of political advocacy in America.",8.0,23.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,744.0,0.8846153846153846,0.030913978494623656

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

In a revelation that has sparked renewed debate, a CBS investigation uncovered that the Obama administration reportedly allocated $770 million in taxpayer funds for the renovation of mosques overseas. The story, dating back to 2015, has resurfaced amidst an evolving conversation about government spending and priorities that originally received limited media coverage.

The investigation raises significant concerns among critics regarding whether these funds unintentionally support groups with suspected ties to terrorism. Detractors argue that this expenditure is emblematic of President Obama’s purported connections to Islamic interests, further fueling a discourse surrounding the administration’s approach to foreign relations, particularly in Islamic countries.

Many Americans are struggling economically, and critics emphasize that diverting such substantial funds abroad raises questions about the prioritization of domestic needs. With portions of the population facing unemployment and economic hardship, the question lingers: should taxpayer dollars be used to refurbish religious buildings overseas when pressing issues at home remain unresolved?

Taxpayer advocates have voiced their outrage, arguing that the expenditure reflects a misguided use of public funds that could instead be directed toward addressing domestic issues such as job creation, infrastructure repair, and social services. This sentiment encapsulates a growing frustration among citizens who feel their financial contributions should first be utilized to improve conditions within the United States.

In defending the spending, officials from the State Department have suggested that the initiative aims to combat Islamic extremism through the cultivation of relationships with Islamic leaders. Supporters of this argument contend that fostering goodwill in the region could lead to more stable interactions and reduce the probability of extremist groups gaining influence. However, the effectiveness and ethics of this approach continue to be heavily scrutinized by various groups.

Adding to the controversy is a perception of economic redistribution to Islamic nations at a time when the U.S. economy is faltering. Critics argue that the billions spent abroad are a misuse of taxpayer money, as they reflect a significant demographic shift that some American citizens view as a challenge to national stability. The influx of Muslim refugees into the United States is perceived by some as not only dramatically altering the nation’s cultural landscape but also as a potential threat to its established norms and values.

As the discourse continues to evolve, there are increasing calls for transparency and accountability regarding government spending on foreign religious buildings and groups. Advocates for fiscal responsibility emphasize the need for policymakers to critically assess the implications of such funding measures, especially when many Americans are enduring economic hardships.

Ultimately, the investigation into mosque renovation funding shines a light on a contentious intersection of foreign relations, domestic priorities, and public sentiment. With tax dollars diverted to Islamic countries amid struggling domestic conditions, the debate over the balance between international diplomacy and home-grown economic stability is likely to persist.

As additional scrutiny falls upon government spending practices, it remains to be seen whether further investigations will lead to changes in policy or public attitudes toward the U.S. government's financial engagements abroad. The longstanding questions of prioritization, national identity, and the utilization of taxpayer funds are as pertinent today as they were eight years ago, making it essential for citizens to remain informed and engaged in these discussions.",-13.0,-13.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,598.0,-0.65,-0.021739130434782608

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

In a bold response to the ongoing threat posed by ISIS and other terrorist groups, the Marine Corps has launched a nationwide billboard campaign aimed at instilling confidence and resilience in the face of fear and intimidation. These groups leverage propaganda and terror to achieve their objectives, seeking not only conversions to Islam but also a cycle of subservience to their extremist views.

However, Marines refuse to be cowed by these threats.

According to Marine Corps representatives, the pressing need to communicate readiness was never clearer. ""We want our fellow Americans to know that we are always ready to protect them, regardless of the fear tactics employed by terrorists,"" a Marine Corps spokesperson remarked. 

While supporters rally behind the message of visual resilience, critics have emerged, particularly among liberal factions. They argue that such initiatives may prioritize American self-defense over understanding and addressing the complexities of terrorism. Critics accuse the campaign of inadvertently legitimizing the motivations of terrorists instead of focusing on nuanced approaches to prevention. 

Nevertheless, the billboards firmly reject the culture of fear that terrorists hope to instill. They symbolize a defiant stance, underscoring that when society stands united and unafraid, the power of terror diminishes significantly. ""Our message is clear,"" said one Marine, ""if we don’t allow fear to dictate our actions or behavior, those who spread hate and violence cannot win.""

In essence, these billboards represent a call to action that not only boosts morale within the military but also instills confidence among the public. They challenge the narrative propagated by terrorist groups and serve as a stark reminder that the United States remains steadfast in the face of adversity. The spirit of resilience that the Marine Corps embodies is an essential counter-narrative to the tactics employed by groups like ISIS, who thrive on chaos and fear. 

As the campaign unfolds, the message remains clear: the Marines are dedicated to protecting American values and the safety of its citizens, standing resolute against the forces of terror.",-53.0,-32.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,478.0,-1.6842105263157894,-0.06694560669456066

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, NC – Rioting in Charlotte has plunged the city into chaos, marked by widespread looting and extensive property destruction. Authorities have responded swiftly to the disorder, with North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory declaring a state of emergency in a bid to regain control.

In light of the escalating violence, Governor McCrory has ordered the deployment of the National Guard to the affected areas. This move is aimed at restoring order and ensuring the safety of residents as the city grapples with the fallout from the unrest. Local officials have also announced a new proclamation targeting the rioters, looters, and violent offenders, which outlines strict consequences for those engaging in unlawful behavior.

One of the most significant measures included in the proclamation is the potential revocation of government benefits for individuals found participating in criminal activities. Authorities are taking a hard stance, underscoring that continuity of governmental assistance is in jeopardy for offenders. Furthermore, the initiative particularly draws attention to the involvement of minors in violent acts. Under the new measures, children engaged in such activities may face repercussions that extend to their parents, potentially putting family benefits at risk.

City official Wilson Stewart stressed the importance of parental responsibility amid the turmoil. He has urged parents to be vigilant and aware of their children's actions during this volatile time. This emphasis on accountability is echoed by the alarming evidence that many of those arrested during the protests have been high school students. The call for parents to take a more active role in monitoring their children’s movements has become increasingly urgent as the situation unfolds.

In an effort to curb further unrest, a mandatory curfew has been implemented in Charlotte. This curfew is designed to deter individuals from gathering in large groups and engaging in disruptive behavior. Local law enforcement is working closely with the National Guard to enforce this curfew and ensure that violators face immediate consequences.

The events in Charlotte have sparked a citywide debate about the root causes of the unrest and how best to address them through community engagement and improved parental oversight. As families face potential repercussions from their children's actions, local leaders are calling for a communal approach to resolving the tensions that have erupted into violence.

Officials are urging community members to cooperate with law enforcement and report any suspicious activities. As Charlotte attempts to navigate this crisis, the focus will remain on restoring peace and safety to the city while holding accountable those who choose violence and disorder.

As the situation continues to evolve, residents are left grappling with the aftermath of the rioting and contemplating the implications of the state emergency and the new regulations set forth by state officials. The city of Charlotte is now at a pivotal juncture as it seeks to recover from this upheaval and rebuild its community in the wake of significant challenges ahead.",-33.0,-29.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,534.0,-1.3181818181818181,-0.054307116104868915

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey finds himself in a precarious position, with potential resignation looming as criticism mounts over his handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email practices. The spotlight has intensified following revelations that Comey granted immunity to some of Clinton’s top aides, an action that many are questioning.

Among those granted immunity is Cheryl Mills, Clinton's Chief of Staff, who reportedly refused to cooperate fully with investigators. This decision to extend immunity has drawn significant backlash, with critics alleging that it undermines the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation.

The controversy surrounding Comey's actions has prompted the House Judiciary Committee to schedule a crucial hearing for September 28th, where legislators will assess the implications of his decisions and determine his future in the role. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has emerged as a vocal critic of Comey, calling for his resignation and casting doubt on Comey’s fitness to continue as FBI Director. DiGenova's allegations point to a lack of rigor in the FBI's investigative processes, particularly in regard to the immunization of individuals with potential criminal liability.

The situation escalated as Congress, in response to demands for increased scrutiny of the investigation, prepared to hold hearings that may further interrogate Comey's decisions. Additionally, Comey has now been issued a subpoena from Congress, primarily due to his failure to comply with requests for documents pertinent to the ongoing email scandal.

The knot of concerns spiraling around Comey’s conduct includes troubling questions about his loyalties and motivations. Critics have begun to ponder whether Comey’s decisions have been unduly influenced by a relationship with Clinton, speculating whether he is prepared to jeopardize his own career in defense of her. These accusations reflect a broader dissatisfaction with the handling of the investigation, suggesting that the FBI's integrity may be at stake.

The unfolding situation not only raises alarms about the legitimacy of the investigation into Clinton’s email practices but also challenges the credibility of the FBI leadership under Comey. With mounting pressure from the media, Congress, and political figures demanding accountability and clarity, the bureau finds itself in a contentious position.

As September 28th approaches, all eyes will be on the House Judiciary Committee, where Comey’s fate will be deliberated amid the heated national discourse surrounding the email investigation. His tenure as FBI Director hangs in the balance, with implications that could echo well beyond this immediate scandal, potentially reshaping public perceptions of the FBI's role in political matters. 

Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation remains a flashpoint in contemporary American politics, reflecting deeper rifts regarding transparency, accountability, and the trust in governmental institutions. Whether he can navigate through this growing crisis remains uncertain, but the stakes of his leadership have never been higher.",-17.0,-28.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,536.0,-1.5555555555555556,-0.05223880597014925

The ongoing U.S. support for Saudi Arabia has come under intense scrutiny as critics highlight the kingdom's troubling ties to terrorism and its reliance on oil revenues. Concerns have been raised regarding the implications of such a relationship, particularly in light of tragic events such as the September 11 attacks, where a notable majority of the hijackers were identified as Saudi nationals. This revelation has fueled a debate about the geopolitical ramifications of the U.S.-Saudi alliance.

Adding to the controversy, the Saudi deputy crown prince recently alleged that Saudi Arabia funded 20% of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. This statement has sparked discussions about the ethical dimensions of political funding and the potential influence of foreign nations on American politics. Critics have pointed out that accepting financial support from countries notorious for their human rights violations raises questions about a candidate's commitment to national security.

The scrutiny of Clinton deepens with accusations against her for accepting campaign contributions from nations considered threats to U.S. security, which include not only Saudi Arabia but also Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Critics argue that such connections could compromise the integrity of American foreign policy, especially as they pertain to international human rights.

In a chilling context, reports have surfaced that Saudi Arabia is auctioning ISIS captives, particularly sex slaves, to the highest bidder. This heinous system of exploitation reportedly includes individuals from various nationalities, underscoring the horrific global ramifications of the Islamic State's practices. The continued abuse and trafficking of sex slaves by ISIS remains a grave concern, particularly with the targeting of vulnerable groups such as Yazidi girls. 

Eyewitness accounts have emerged detailing the disturbing reality of women being auctioned, with reports indicating the involvement of diverse actors, including Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis, and Westerners. These accounts reveal a stark reality: the Islamic State is enforcing a brutal regime of slavery and exploitation, specifically targeting non-Muslim women, which has included victims from Western countries.

Critics of current rescue efforts highlight a troubling trend where women rescued from ISIS captivity are often sold into further exploitation rather than finding safety and support. This has led to a critical evaluation of strategies aimed at combatting human trafficking and protecting victims, questioning the effectiveness of initiatives meant to dismantle these trafficking networks.

Moreover, the allegations against Hillary Clinton extend to her perceived complicity in the ongoing crisis involving human trafficking and exploitation. Her associations with nations that have allegedly contributed to the global problem of human trafficking have drawn fierce condemnation. Many see her connections as not simply a conflict of interest but as a deeper involvement that could jeopardize both domestic and international human rights initiatives.

The controversies surrounding U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, the political funding allegations linked to Clinton, and the horrific revelations about ISIS’s sexual enslavement initiatives paint a disturbing picture of interlinked crises. As debates unfold about the nature and implications of such relationships, it becomes increasingly apparent that U.S. foreign policy carries weighty consequences, both in terms of national security and human rights advocacy.

In the face of these multifaceted challenges, critics are calling for a reevaluation of alliances and a more stringent approach toward countries that engage in human rights abuses. The relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia raises critical questions about moral responsibility versus strategic interests, urging a reassessment of what it means for the U.S. to champion global security and human rights in an interconnected world.",-30.0,-43.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,643.0,-1.9545454545454546,-0.06687402799377916
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was marked by intense exchanges that highlighted the stark differences in their respective platforms. As the candidates went head-to-head, the role of NBC moderator Lester Holt came under scrutiny, particularly regarding his interactions with Trump.

Critics quickly pointed out that Holt seemed to disproportionately interrupt Trump for “fact-checks,” many of which were deemed inaccurate. One of the flashpoints of the evening occurred when Holt asserted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the outset. This claim ignited a heated back-and-forth, as Trump vehemently disputed Holt's assertion, insisting that he had reservations about the invasion. 

Despite this contentious moment, Holt did not similarly press Clinton on her own vote in favor of the Iraq War, which has become a controversial aspect of her political history. Instead, Holt focused his questioning exclusively on Trump’s stance, raising concerns about potential bias in the moderation of the debate.

Adding to the debate's drama, a subsequent airing of an interview by Fox News’ Neil Cavuto revealed Trump's previously unreported reservations about the decision to invade Iraq. In the interview, Trump articulated a level of uncertainty regarding the war and suggested that it might have been prudent to wait for a consensus from the United Nations before taking action.

This episode has sparked a broader discussion about the responsibility of the media in shaping public perception during high-stakes political events. Observers have expressed concern that mainstream media may be attempting to tarnish Trump’s reputation by highlighting inaccuracies and inconsistencies without delivering the same level of scrutiny on Clinton.

In the face of these challenges, Trump appeared to effectively defend himself against both Clinton and the critical tide of media scrutiny during the debate. His assertive responses seemed to resonate with some viewers, as he aimed to clarify his position on the war and other key issues.

As the election race continues, both sides are expected to engage in increasingly vigorous debates, and the reactions to the first presidential debate are likely to shape the narrative moving forward. The conflict between Trump and Holt, along with the subsequent media coverage, underscores the contentious nature of this election cycle and raises important questions about the role of moderators in political discourse. 

With the stakes higher than ever, voters are left to navigate a landscape rife with partisanship and media narratives that could profoundly impact their decision-making in the lead-up to Election Day.",-9.0,-15.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,467.0,-0.9375,-0.032119914346895075
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

In the ongoing conversation surrounding former President Barack Obama’s birthplace, a recent examination of past articles raises questions not only about the veracity of the claims made against him but also about the potential racial undertones of the Birther movement. An insightful piece from Breitbart has reignited discussions about the implications of labeling Obama as ""not truly American."" 

This investigation begins with a notable Associated Press article from 2004, which referred to Obama as a ""Kenyan-born"" candidate amidst his rise as a U.S. Senate hopeful. At that time, his primary competitor, Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race due to a scandal, leaving Obama in a position of favorable visibility. Notably, Obama chose not to publicly refute the claims made in this 2004 article, which adds layers to the complexity surrounding his birthplace and citizenship.

Further complicating the narrative are details from a 1991 promotional booklet created by Obama’s literary agency. The booklet intriguingly describes him as ""born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii."" This description leads to pivotal questions regarding the consistency of Obama’s statements about his origins. Critics argue that if Obama did, in fact, misrepresent his birthplace for personal or political gain, it could undermine his American citizenship—a crucial requirement for the presidency.

The implications of such alleged deception resonate deeply within the fabric of American political discourse. While some view the Birther movement as racially motivated, others argue that the inconsistencies in Obama’s background, whether real or perceived, deserve scrutiny. This dichotomy significantly shapes public perception and aids the ongoing debate about identity in American politics. Readers are encouraged to consider both scenarios: Did Obama misrepresent his background knowingly, or are these accusations driven by a deeper racial animus?

In questioning Obama’s narrative, the intention is not solely to discredit his presidency but to explore the broader implications of racial identity and perception in politics. The articles suggest that the complexities surrounding Obama’s birthplace may reflect a larger societal struggle with race, identity, and authenticity in leadership.

As discussions continue to unfold, the original Breitbart piece and the associated materials warrant close examination. A link to the original article, as well as a screen capture, is provided for those interested in delving deeper into this contentious topic.

In conclusion, the investigation of Barack Obama's birthplace, while tied up in the specifics of his life history, challenges us to investigate the narratives surrounding race and identity in the political arena.",-18.0,-7.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,482.0,-0.3888888888888889,-0.014522821576763486

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

The political arena is abuzz following the recent debate featuring Hillary Clinton, as observers voice a mix of admiration and skepticism regarding her performance. While many noted her preparation and detailed responses, the absence of her usual coughing fits seemed to stand out, raising eyebrows among followers and critics alike.

During the debate, Clinton’s well-crafted replies appeared to garner her praise from supporters who felt she effectively addressed key issues. However, the absence of her typical coughing during a high-pressure event has triggered a wave of discussion, prompting some to look closer at her presentation. Social media exploded with speculation after some viewers reported noticing a flesh-colored device visible in her ear, stirring intrigue and debate among commentators.

The speculation quickly spiraled into a broader discussion about the nature of this device. Users across various platforms asked whether it was, in fact, an earpiece, likely intended for receiving instructions or information in real-time, or merely a new fashion accessory. Clinton's campaign rushed to quell the ensuing controversy by denying the use of an earpiece, instead attributing the appearance of the device to a reflection caused by the television lights.

Adding fuel to the fire, an email uncovered in the WikiLeaks archive alluded to a conversation between Clinton and her trusted aide Huma Abedin regarding the potential use of an earpiece. This revelation added a layer of intrigue to an already charged atmosphere, prompting critics to accuse Clinton of needing assistance to communicate effectively during such a crucial event.

Despite the intense scrutiny, there remains no definitive proof that Clinton wore an earpiece during the debate. Some analysts have suggested an alternative explanation, arguing that the object could simply be a hearing aid or even an optical illusion caused by lighting or camera angles. The debate over the claims has persisted, with social media comments oscillating between conspiracy theories and practical explanations.

Contrasting opinions have emerged regarding the device’s nature as pundits and casual viewers alike weigh in with their viewpoints. While some express disbelief that the seasoned politician would resort to technological assistance, others argue that the physical evidence viewed in photos represents a legitimate concern about her trustworthiness in delivering unassisted responses.

As discussions about the debate's implications rush forth, the question remains whether this latest controversy will significantly impact Clinton's campaign or if it will serve merely as a fleeting distraction. Political observers will undoubtedly continue watching closely as the fallout unfolds, analyzing the effects of this incident on public perception and Clinton's standing among supporters and detractors alike.

In a political climate filled with constant scrutiny and evolving narratives, the spotlight on Clinton’s performance reflects broader concerns about transparency and authenticity among public figures, a topic as critical now as ever in the quest for voter trust and engagement in the electoral process. The ripple effects from this debate may linger, fueling discussions and debates well beyond the immediate aftermath of Clinton's controversial performance. As social media continues to buzz with reactions, the potential consequences of this incident remain an open question in the ever-evolving world of politics.",-5.0,-17.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,581.0,-0.85,-0.029259896729776247
