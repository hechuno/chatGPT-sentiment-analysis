Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

In an unexpected twist that has cast a shadow over Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, former President Bill Clinton stated in an NPR interview that it is “natural” for donors to the Clinton Foundation to request favors. This comment has sparked reactions that suggest potential negative implications for Hillary Clinton as she seeks to solidify her candidacy for the White House.

The remarks come amidst growing scrutiny from critics, particularly Donald Trump, who has long accused the Clinton Foundation of operating under a pay-to-play model. Trump’s accusations hinge on the belief that donors to the foundation have received preferential treatment, thus undermining the integrity of both the foundation and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Bill Clinton's characterization of donor behavior only fuels these assertions, opening up new lines of criticism against the former Secretary of State.

While Bill Clinton did clarify that merely asking for favors does not ensure that they will be granted, the ambiguity surrounding his comments has heightened concerns about the ethical implications of the foundation's operations. Critics argue that the optics alone present a risk to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, which has emphasized transparency and integrity.

Recent revelations have amplified these concerns. Leaked emails indicate that some donors to the Clinton Foundation did secure meetings that were not accessible to the general public. However, important to note is the lack of concrete evidence proving that these instances amounted to pay-to-play arrangements. The distinction is crucial as it underscores the complexity surrounding the foundation's operations and the donors involved.

In a stark contrast to the Clinton Foundation's practices, Trump's own charitable activities have come under fire. Critics point out that Trump has not made a personal donation to his own foundation since 2008 and instead has been reported to collect and reallocate funds for personal items. This comparison raises questions about the integrity of Trump's philanthropic efforts, especially in light of ongoing investigations into his foundation.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has launched an investigation into Trump's foundation to determine potential improprieties related to charity laws. The inquiry is expected to probe how Trump has managed charitable contributions and whether the actions align with legal standards. This investigation adds a layer of complexity to the political narrative, as it underscores that not all charitable organizations operate under the same ethical scrutiny.

Media scrutiny on both candidates has sparked debates about fairness and bias within mainstream coverage. Media Matters has highlighted concerns over a perceived double standard in how the press reports on President Trump versus Hillary Clinton. Recent coverage trends suggest that Trump has been favored, with substantial reports related to his charitable activities and organizational conduct receiving less focus.

Critics of the media's handling of the narratives argue that this bias may have detrimental effects on Clinton’s campaign. By playing down significant issues tied to Trump’s foundation while amplifying allegations against the Clinton Foundation, they claim that the media’s coverage could adversely impact voter perceptions and decision-making. This discrepancy is concerning for those who advocate for a level playing field in political reporting, where both candidates are held to the same standards.

As Bill Clinton's remarks are dissected, the implications for Hillary Clinton's campaign become increasingly tangible. The intersection of foundation donations, ethical inquiries, and media portrayal creates a challenging environment for the former Secretary of State. With opposing narratives gaining traction, the question remains whether Hillary Clinton can navigate this intricate landscape as she continues her pursuit of the presidency.

In the ever-shifting dynamics of American politics, the complexities surrounding charitable foundations and donor relationships play a significant role. Both the Clinton and Trump scenarios highlight the ongoing need for transparency and accountability within political charitable organizations, demonstrating that the implications of past actions can reverberate strongly in current campaign dynamics. As the election cycle progresses, how these narratives unfold may prove pivotal in shaping public perception and influencing voter choices come Election Day.",6.0,25.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,746.0,0.8620689655172413,0.03351206434316354
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, shedding light on troubling practices concerning HIV/AIDS drug distribution by the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) in sub-Saharan Africa. The document, entitled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" was initiated by Representative Marsha Blackburn and focuses on the partnership between CHAI and Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy. 

The investigation reveals that the HIV/AIDS drugs supplied through CHAI were ""watered-down,"" potentially increasing the health risks for patients reliant on these medications. The ramifications of this report are profound, as it raises significant questions about the safety and effectiveness of treatments prescribed to some of the world's most vulnerable populations.

Ranbaxy, a principal distributor of these medications for CHAI, was previously embroiled in a landmark lawsuit in the United States due to poor manufacturing practices. This legal battle culminated in a 2013 guilty plea and a $500 million fine, which has since cast a long shadow over the company's credibility. 

The report examines how the diluted drugs distributed by CHAI have been correlated with increased morbidity and mortality risks among patients in the affected regions. With the public health impact at stake, the findings are particularly alarming as they suggest that patients may have been misled about the quality of their treatment, leading to avoidable health complications.

Blackburn has officially submitted the report's findings to both the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State. This submission comes at a politically sensitive time, coinciding with Hillary Clinton's current presidential campaign, thereby amplifying the scrutiny of the Clinton family’s philanthropic and political interests.

Moreover, the report indicates that Bill Clinton's connections to Indian-Americans involved in ongoing FDA and SEC investigations add another layer of controversy to the already contentious narrative. The consistent quality control issues at Ranbaxy further emphasize the foundation's apparent disregard for product safety, despite having been aware of the company's substandard practices since at least 2004.

Critics argue that CHAI not only overlooked significant red flags regarding Ranbaxy’s manufacturing quality but actively promoted the company as a key partner in battling the HIV/AIDS crisis. This troubling relationship raises serious ethical questions about the rationale behind endorsing a supplier known for its compromised medication quality.

The report also highlights inadequate regulatory oversight that may have allowed these inferior products to flood the market, which could have dire consequences for patient health and safety. The lack of stringent monitoring suggests a systemic failure to protect the very individuals the initiative aimed to assist, exacerbating existing health crises rather than alleviating them.

Meanwhile, Bill Clinton has publicly lauded Ranbaxy's contributions to global healthcare initiatives, seemingly disregarding the accusations of negligence and poor quality associated with the company's output. This public endorsement, given the emerging details of the report, paints a concerning picture of accountability and responsibility in governance.

Even after CHAI reportedly separated from the Clinton Foundation in 2010, its ongoing collaboration with Ranbaxy raises further concerns about the continuity of these issues. The persistence of these partnerships, despite the spotlight on Ranbaxy’s troubled history, calls into question the operational integrity of organizations like CHAI and their commitment to patient welfare.

Key figures from CHAI's past are also under scrutiny, with investigations into potential corruption and the implications of donor contributions. The findings of this congressional report raise worrying scenarios about how donations and grants may be used, highlighting the need for transparency and rigorous ethical standards in all philanthropic endeavors.

Reflecting on the situation, Blackburn emphasized the emotional toll experienced by healthcare workers and patients who may have been misled by the promises made by the Clinton Foundation. The reality that their lives could have been affected by inadequate medication, provided under the guise of helping the sick, adds a painful dimension to this unfolding scenario. 

As the full implications of the report unfold, it becomes clear that these revelations present not just questions of accountability for Bill Clinton and his initiatives but also a comprehensive reevaluation of how global health partnerships operate. The health and lives of countless individuals hang in the balance, and in a world increasingly interconnected through charitable initiatives and global health programs, the importance of responsibility, transparency, and ethical practices becomes ever more crucial. 

With healthcare risks now laid bare and a political landscape already fraught with tension, the ramifications of this report could extend far beyond the immediate accusations against CHAI and Ranbaxy. How the Clintons address these allegations—and the responses from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries—will be closely watched in the weeks and months ahead. The need for comprehensive changes in how organizations ensure accountability in drug quality and distribution is clearer now than ever, as global health efforts continue to be essential in addressing crises that affect millions of people worldwide. 

In conclusion, the congressional report initiated by Rep. Blackburn serves as a critical reminder of the responsibilities borne by those in power, particularly when the health and well-being of vulnerable populations are at stake. It invites a broader conversation on governance, oversight, and the complex relationship between philanthropy and global health initiatives, urging stakeholders to prioritize the safety and efficacy of treatments above all else. As further investigations are warranted, the hope is that lessons learned from this sagacious report will result in meaningful change that protects patients and enhances the integrity of healthcare initiatives around the globe.",-6.0,4.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1002.0,0.125,0.003992015968063872
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a shocking incident during the 9/11 commemorative ceremony in New York City, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed while attempting to enter her van. This alarming episode has prompted widespread speculation regarding her health and future public appearances.

Footage and eyewitness accounts confirmed the incident, with many expressing concern for Clinton’s well-being. Just hours after the incident, however, Clinton made an unexpected appearance at her daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment, appearing revitalized and notably lighter in demeanor. Those who witnessed both events pointed out striking differences in her appearance that raised eyebrows. Prominent among these differences was a noticeable alteration in what many described as Clinton's ""Nordic"" nose, augmented in a way that gave the impression of a more youthful version of herself. This alteration has sparked a flurry of conversation and conjecture regarding the authenticity of the figure seen later that day.

Further compounding the speculation is the absence of distinct moles on the presented figure, moles that are typically associated with the genuine Hillary Clinton. These peculiar variations have led some to wonder whether the woman seen leaving the 9/11 ceremony was indeed Clinton or a double—an idea that some theorists have hinted at in the past.

As the dimensions of the speculation continue to grow, significant questions arise regarding Clinton’s ability to effectively engage in her campaign against Donald Trump. Her health challenges bring to light genuine concerns about her participation in the upcoming debates, which are critical moments for any political candidate. Observers are keenly aware that any differences in appearance or demeanor during such public engagements could fuel debate over whether it is truly Hillary Clinton presenting herself to the nation or if she has chosen to delegate these responsibilities to a clone or double.

With the political landscape becoming more contentious by the day, observers are asking critical questions. Some posit that even if Clinton were to secure the presidency, it may not be the real Hillary Clinton who occupies the public stage. Instead, there looms the possibility that a double could take charge of her public responsibilities, a scenario that some critics argue could allow Clinton’s management of the presidency to take place without her direct involvement. This notion, if substantiated, would mirror earlier administrations, leading to discussions about past presidents, notably Barack Obama, and the level of their public engagement during their terms.

Public reactions and opinions regarding this situation vary widely. While conspiracy theories often flourish in political arenas, the potential implications for Clinton's campaign and health remain a matter of serious concern for many. The possibility that the nation’s future leader might not be present in their own capacity raises alarm bells about transparency and authenticity in political representation.

As the political landscape evolves, the focus will undoubtedly shift toward upcoming campaign appearances and debates where perceptions of Hillary Clinton will be scrutinized more closely than ever. Will the electorate see the real Hillary Clinton, or will her double take to the stage? The ever-deepening intrigue surrounding her health and public persona continues to command attention as these significant moments draw closer.

The opinions expressed within this report are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the publication. As the campaign proceeds, further developments will undoubtedly reshape the dialogues surrounding both her health and the authenticity of her public representation. The American public watches keenly as the narrative unfolds, hoping to glean insights into what could be one of the most pivotal elections in recent history.",8.0,9.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,662.0,0.36,0.013595166163141994
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

As the 2016 presidential election approaches, Donald Trump’s statements regarding immigration and terrorism have sparked significant controversy and concern among various communities across the United States. His views not only express stark opinions on these sensitive issues but also raise questions about the implications for American society should he ascend to the presidency.

Trump garnered notoriety early in his campaign by suggesting the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as a measure to keep out what he labeled “rapists” and “drug dealers.” This focus on building a physical barrier reflects a broader narrative that frames immigrants as a threat to national safety, a tactic that resonates with some segments of the electorate but alienates others.

Moreover, Trump has proposed a national registry for Muslims, reminiscent of historical actions taken against Jewish populations in the past. The idea echoes dark chapters of history, including forced identification badges and the looming threat of internment, raising alarming concerns about civil liberties and the potential for discrimination against Muslim Americans.

The rhetoric continues to escalate as Trump has openly suggested that the families of terrorists should face punitive measures, advocating for their deaths as a strategy to deter potential threats. His assertion that such actions would disrupt the motives of terrorists underscores an approach that many view as excessively harsh and morally questionable.

In the wake of recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, Trump took the opportunity to challenge the narratives presented by President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, deflecting from a direct discourse on terrorism itself. Instead of addressing the root of the violence and the motivations behind it, Trump's comments shifted toward a criticism of the current administration’s policies and strategies, raising further doubts about his understanding of the complexities involved in combatting terrorism.

Trump's relentless criticism of immigration policies has become a cornerstone of his campaign. He insists that inadequately managed policies have allowed dangerous individuals to attain U.S. citizenship, thereby increasing the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism. His claims, while popular among his supporters, provoke concern among immigrant communities and civil rights advocates who argue that such blanket statements unfairly stigmatize entire populations based on the actions of a few.

In emphasizing a narrative of fear, Trump portrays the need to eradicate terrorism as a means of protecting American citizens and values. He has called on Muslims within the country to actively report suspicious individuals, a call that many believe could lead to a culture of mistrust and discrimination that challenges community cohesion.

Amid his controversial statements, worries also loom regarding how Trump may define terrorism. His potential presidency could usher in a new era of law enforcement that might disproportionately target Muslim Americans, thereby exacerbating existing tensions and fears among marginalized communities. The ambiguity surrounding his policies creates a palpable sense of anxiety, leading many to question how safety and civil liberties would coexist under his leadership.

Another pressing concern is Trump's unpredictable behavior, particularly in regards to conflict situations. His aggressive stance raises alarms about his approach to international relations, including his casual references to nuclear weapons. Such talk raises ethical dilemmas and provokes a discussion about the stability of global politics if a commander-in-chief were to approach military engagement with a volatile mindset. 

The events in New York and New Jersey—bombings attributed to an American citizen—further complicate Trump's proposed immigration-centric solutions to terrorism. These incidents illuminate the complexities of national security and the limitations of solely focusing on border control and immigration policies. The reality suggests that threats can emerge from within, presenting challenges that figures like Trump may not be equipped to address adequately.

Citizens and commentators alike have expressed apprehensions about Trump's potential presidency, specifically regarding how his views and policies could shape the way America interacts with both its own citizens and the global community. Many advocates warn against the dangers of normalizing his rhetoric and urge voters to consider the broader implications of endorsing such policies through their votes. 

As Americans prepare to head to the polls, the fear of what Trump’s rise to power could mean for immigration policy, civil liberties, and the overall fabric of American identity sits heavily on the minds of many. The stakes have never been higher, and the choices made in the upcoming election may define the country’s core values for generations to come. Voting is posited not just as a civic duty, but as a necessary countermeasure against divisive and dangerous rhetoric that threatens to challenge the principles of inclusivity and respect that many hold dear.

In a climate rife with division, the need for a thoughtful, grounded approach to issues of immigration and national security becomes all the more critical. As candidates articulate their visions for America, voters must be mindful of the narratives being promoted and their potential ramifications for all citizens. Together, they can shape a future that honors the diverse tapestry that makes up the United States, rejecting fear-driven policies that undermine collective strength and unity.",-71.0,-48.0,888.0,-2.2903225806451615,-0.07995495495495496,930.0,-1.5483870967741935,-0.05161290322580645

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, discussing the concept of One World Government.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

The Clinton Foundation is under intense scrutiny as critics voice concerns regarding its financial practices and the true nature of its charitable work. The foundation, established by former President Bill Clinton, has defended its activities amidst allegations of a pay-to-play operation that allegedly benefited the Clintons and their associates financially.

Supporters of the foundation emphasize its charitable efforts, pointing to various initiatives aimed at global health and poverty alleviation. However, critics argue that these initiatives are overshadowed by the foundation's financial allocations, suggesting that it functions more as a profit-generating enterprise rather than a genuine charity.

IRS filings from 2014 reveal that the Clinton Foundation allocated a mere 5.7% of its budget to charitable grants. With total spending nearing $91.3 million for that year, less than $5.2 million was directed toward charitable grants. This financial distribution has raised eyebrows among watchdog groups, prompting further investigation into how the foundation utilizes its funds.

A significant portion of the foundation’s spending in 2014 was directed towards employee compensation. Salaries accounted for approximately $34.8 million, while the expenses labeled as “other” reached $50.4 million. Additionally, nearly $851,000 was spent solely on professional fundraising efforts. Critics have pointed out that these figures suggest a prioritization of administrative costs over direct charitable contributions.

Despite an increase in overall income, noted at $30 million in 2014, the foundation cut its charitable grants by 40% when compared to the previous year. This contradiction between rising income and reduced charitable output has fueled allegations that the foundation is more interested in sustaining its operation and paying its employees than it is in fulfilling its purported mission of charity.

The ramifications of these financial choices have led many to question the true intentions of the Clinton Foundation. Some observers suggest that the foundation may have served as a vehicle for the Clintons to accumulate wealth while leveraging their political connections to secure substantial donations from various sources.

As scrutiny continues, the Clinton Foundation finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with the impact of these allegations on its public image and mission. With a need for transparency and accountability more critical than ever, stakeholders are calling for an in-depth examination of its financial practices to ensure that charitable contributions are genuinely benefiting those in need, rather than enriching those at the top.",25.0,24.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,438.0,1.411764705882353,0.0547945205479452
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

During that event, Clinton experienced convulsions, which her campaign attributed to the heat. Despite this explanation, the weather in NYC at the time was reported to be a mild 74 degrees.

The Greensboro rally sparked concerns regarding its authenticity, with some speculating that the event may have been staged. Observers noted peculiarities in a video from the rally, raising questions about the presence of suspicious cameras in the audience that seemed out of place.

In response to the scrutiny, a follow-up video analyzed cues that suggested the rally audience might have been fabricated. This led to further debates about the legitimacy of the event amidst ongoing discussions about Clinton's health. 

To counter these allegations, an actual C-Span video was provided to affirm that previous videos were not doctored, supporting the authenticity of the rally. This latest public engagement underscores the heightened scrutiny surrounding Clinton, as both her health and the nature of her campaign appearances remain focal points of discussion among supporters and critics alike. The Greensboro rally serves as a critical moment as Clinton navigates her political landscape following a challenging few weeks.",4.0,-4.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,241.0,-0.4,-0.016597510373443983
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the cinematic world gears up for the release of a fictional film titled ""Weekend at Chelsea's,"" anticipation is palpable among audiences eager for its humorous take on unconventional scenarios. Yet, this playful title evokes not only laughter but also a serious undercurrent of social commentary surrounding its namesake, Hillary Clinton. The contrast between satire and the pressing political narrative offers fertile ground for discussion, particularly in light of recent observations about Clinton’s character, health, and the mainstream media's coverage of her.

In recent times, there has been increasing scrutiny of how mainstream media portray Hillary Clinton, often accused of showing bias in her favor. Critics argue that this insistence on a favorable narrative obscures critical discussions about her fitness for office. Fanning the flames of this contention are ongoing claims about Clinton’s health that have circulated among various factions, creating a pernicious blend of skepticism and concern.

Health-related issues for Clinton date back to at least 2003, as highlighted by a traveling physician and a ""mystery man"" often seen by her side during medical episodes. These reports suggest a complex history filled with alleged health challenges, fueling speculation about her wellbeing. Many sources insist that the symptoms she exhibits may hint at serious conditions that have been downplayed by the political establishment. 

Among the conjectured health issues, seizures and even a potential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease have taken center stage. These claims are met with a mix of skepticism and disbelief from supporters and detractors alike. As Clinton’s health has been framed as a mere anecdote of ""minor"" conditions, the juxtaposition of her public persona against these serious allegations raises eyebrows. It seems that the narrative cultivated by her camp aims to appeal to an audience reluctant to confront the possibility of debilitating illness in a potential future president.

To compound matters, Clinton’s declining poll numbers signal a troubling trajectory for her political ambitions. Recent controversies, including derogatory remarks about certain segments of Donald Trump’s supporters, have added richness to this complex political landscape. Critics argue that her inability to connect with broad swathes of the electorate further casts doubt on her suitability for the presidential office. With every passing day, her legacy grows murkier, ensnaring her in a web of her own making.

In the face of declining support, tensions flare over what some perceive as hypocrisy in Clinton’s approach to race relations. While she has positioned herself as a champion for diversity and equality, critics have not hesitated to remind the public of her historical associations with individuals connected to the Ku Klux Klan. This juxtaposition between her lofty rhetoric and questionable relationships has opened another front in the battle for public perception. Many are left wondering whether these associations reflect a deeper, more troubling inconsistency in her political actions and personal beliefs.

While it’s impossible to ignore the scale of her political missteps and the unending questions about her health, there is a conflicting recognition of the human experience that underpins much of Clinton’s story. Despite various criticisms of her character, the author expresses a sense of empathy toward her health struggles. This duality reflects a broader human sentiment—wishing for personal well-being even while simultaneously calling for accountability. Society's insistence on political perfection often falters against the very real human experience of health and vulnerability.

What does the future hold for Clinton and her political aspirations? There is a flicker of hope among some corners of the electorate for a potential decline in her political career. However, it is coupled with a genuine desire for her personal health to improve. It is this delicate balance that underscores the conversations surrounding her figure—where the personal and political collide in a tempest of emotions, opinions, and speculation.

Thus, as ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" approaches with its lighthearted promise, it serves as a poignant reminder of the realities many political figures face, illustrating how humor can emerge even against a backdrop of seriousness. The discussions surrounding health, character, media bias, and public perception coalesce into a complex narrative about one of America’s most polarizing figures.

Critics are not shy to vocalize their sentiments, emphasizing the necessity for transparency from political leaders regarding their health—something that Clinton’s narrative fails to provide adequately, if at all. Skepticism surrounding her transparency continues to drive a wedge between her and the electorate, leading many to question whether she possesses the vigor required for the ultimate job in American politics.

As we navigate these discussions, it's crucial to remember the personal nature of health struggles, and how they can shape, yet also cloud, one's political journey. While Clinton’s character may invite scrutiny, compassion must still find space amidst criticism. The hope for her improvement health-wise must come with the recognition of the broader implications that her political choices carry.

In closing, the complex interplay of excitement surrounding a fictional title like ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" juxtaposed against the reality of Hillary Clinton’s life highlights the intricate layers of modern political engagement. The tensions playing out in the public arena invite us to reflect on our values, beliefs, and judgments—not only of political figures but also regarding the broader context of human experience. As the narrative unfolds, one can only hope that both the world of cinema and the realm of politics allow for a kinder intersection of humor and humanity.

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a recent address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama expressed grave concerns regarding the efficacy of military strategies in combating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. As he spoke to world leaders, Obama underscored the limitations of military power against these factions, referring to them as a ""JV team,"" thereby questioning the effectiveness of current military operations.

Obama's speech articulated a stark assessment of the United States' role in international conflicts. He candidly stated that the U.S. could not serve as ""the global police force,"" urging a shift away from the notion that military intervention could conclusively resolve complex global threats. This sentiment was particularly evident as he cited the alarming growth of the Islamic State group, which he used as a pivotal example of the inadequacy of a purely military response to terrorism.

Emphasizing the importance of honesty about the nature of these conflicts, Obama called for a concerted effort among nations to engage in meaningful collaboration with those striving to build peace. While military action can be a component of the strategy, he specifically noted that the situation in Syria is one where no ultimate military victory is conceivable. This assessment challenges the effectiveness of ongoing military campaigns and highlights the need for a more nuanced approach.

In advocating for a renewed focus on diplomacy, Obama recommended prioritizing humanitarian assistance and fostering political settlements across troubled regions. He acknowledged that working with various factions involved in these conflicts might present significant challenges. This point raises questions about the feasibility of establishing a united front against extremist ideologies that pose a global threat.

Moreover, Obama took the opportunity to voice criticism towards liberals who have downplayed the connection between radical Islam and acts of violence. In his view, such dismissals could potentially obscure the realities of the threats faced by nations around the world. He urged for an unflinching examination of these issues, expressing concern that ignoring the real and present danger could exacerbate the situation.

In his call to action, Obama advocated for urgent responses rather than what he characterized as ""polite inaction"" in the face of radical Islam. His remarks underscored the necessity of an earnest dialogue about how to address the complexities of terrorism in a way that acknowledges both the limitations of militaristic solutions and the importance of comprehensive strategies. 

Overall, Obama's address to the U.N. Assembly served as a clarion call for countries to rethink their approaches towards extremist threats, advocating for a robust mix of diplomacy, humanitarian support, and realistic recognition of the challenges ahead. As nations grapple with these pressing issues, his reflections demand serious consideration at a vital moment in global discourse on terrorism and peacebuilding efforts.",-5.0,1.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,511.0,0.05,0.0019569471624266144
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents illustrate that U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA and DIA, were aware of the growing threat posed by ISIS as early as 2012. The revelations paint a complex picture of U.S. involvement in the Syrian conflict, suggesting that the Obama Administration may have supported ISIS with the intention of isolating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed highlights the documents' predictions that increased support from Western nations, Turkey, and Gulf Arab states could inadvertently lead to the establishment of a Salafist principality in Eastern Syria. This premonition points to a level of understanding among U.S. officials regarding the potential consequences of their foreign policy decisions.

The documents also delve into the characterization of ISIS by President Obama as a ""JV"" team, a term that has since been criticized as a significant oversight in assessing the threat level posed by the rising militant group. Additionally, the failure to maintain a residual U.S. force in Iraq has been deemed a critical tactical error by experts analyzing the events that contributed to the emergence of ISIS.

Further insights from the declassified materials shed light on U.S. weapons operations in Libya before the infamous 2012 Benghazi attack. Despite the chaos surrounding the crisis, it is confirmed that U.S. intelligence tracked arms shipments from Benghazi to Syrian ports, indicating an awareness of these movements among officials.

The documents raise troubling allegations suggesting that U.S. servicemen were sacrificed as part of a covert Middle Eastern policy, resulting in the unintended consequences of ISIS's rise. Critics argue that the administration appeared to prioritize the concealment of facts over national security interests, calling into question the motivations behind U.S. interventions in the region.

As discussions around foreign policy and national security continue, these revelations underscore the complexities and ramifications of decisions made during a pivotal period in Middle Eastern history. The implications of this early acknowledgment of ISIS by U.S. intelligence agencies will likely reverberate through ongoing debates about military strategy and intervention ethics.",-27.0,-19.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,381.0,-1.4615384615384615,-0.049868766404199474
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

New York City – In a startling incident following a 9/11 commemoration ceremony, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her vehicle. This moment raised significant concerns about her health ahead of the upcoming electoral campaign and set off a wave of speculation regarding her public appearances moving forward.

Eyewitnesses observed Clinton, who had recently been participating in high-profile events, seemingly struggling to maintain her composure. The incident unfolded as she prepared to get into her van, creating a scene that drew the attention of not just her supporters, but also media personnel and onlookers alike. While her health concerns are not new, the timing of this collapse has prompted renewed scrutiny of her physical condition, particularly in light of her previous remarks on her wellbeing.

However, shortly after the incident, Clinton was seen leaving her daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment, and reports indicate that she appeared markedly different from how she looked earlier in the day. Observers noted that she looked significantly lighter and more vibrant than previously, with features that some claimed resembled a younger version of the former First Lady. Notably, her nose appeared altered compared to previous photos, leading to even more speculation regarding the nature of her recent appearances.

Some commentators and experts have suggested that this transformation in appearance could indicate the use of a stand-in for public events. They argue that given her recent health issues, it may be difficult for Clinton to effectively engage in an intensive campaigning schedule. The implications of this speculation are significant, especially when considering her ability to contend in crucial debates against her prominent opponent, Donald Trump.

As the 2024 election approaches, questions intensify about Clinton's capability to engage in rigorous campaign activities. If health concerns continue to be a barrier, there will be increasing pressure on her campaign team to provide transparency about her physical abilities to participate effectively. This has led some to wonder if her public engagements might be coordinated through a substitute, further fueling discussions about the authenticity and credibility of her presence in the political arena.

Amidst this backdrop, observers are already poised to scrutinize Clinton's appearance at future events meticulously. With varying reports on her health and vitality, distinguishing a potential “stand-in” from the genuine Hillary Clinton could become a significant aspect of her public perception moving forward. The idea that a clone or stand-in could represent her at major political functions carries weighty implications for her campaign legacy.

Speculation regarding the use of a replica or clone heightens curiosity about the functionality of a Clinton Administration should she succeed in the electoral race. Some have suggested that if elected, Clinton could delegate significant public duties to her cabinet, potentially establishing a historical precedent whereby the president may act more as a figurehead, rather than the active leader of the nation. This scenario not only raises questions about the traditional role of the presidency but also the essential functionalities of leadership in modern governance.

Critics and supporters alike are left to ponder the ramifications of such a shift in political dynamics, where decision-making could occur without the president's direct involvement. The thought of significant events—like the inauguration and State of the Union addresses—being conducted by someone other than Clinton could reshape perceptions of presidential authority in the United States.

While the views expressed around these developments are varied and diverse, the dialogue surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and the implications for her political future continues to evolve. What remains clear is that attention will be firmly placed on her appearances, health disclosures, and the potential for unconventional presidential machinations in the near future. 

As citizens await clarity on these pertinent topics, the political landscape remains charged with uncertainty, prompting many to reflect on the very nature of leadership and identity in American politics. The coming months promise to be critical in determining not only Clinton’s path but the broader tapestry of U.S. electoral campaigns as they unfold.",8.0,30.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,737.0,1.1538461538461537,0.0407055630936228
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Speculation regarding Hillary Clinton's well-being has intensified amidst growing concerns about her mental and physical health. Sources suggest that Clinton may be experiencing a nervous breakdown, a notion that gained momentum following the release of a recent video in which she appeared to struggle with eye control. The video has sparked widespread concern among her supporters and political analysts alike.

Shortly after the emergence of the video, Clinton canceled a scheduled fundraiser in North Carolina, further fueling rumors about her health. An analysis of her campaign schedule reveals that between September 20 and October 19, she has only one rally event planned, with no speaking engagements scheduled at fundraisers—raising questions about her ability to maintain a vigorous campaign.

In stark contrast, her political rival, Donald Trump, has four rallies lined up in the same timeframe, underscoring the differing dynamics in the lead-up to the presidential election. This discrepancy highlights the challenges Clinton faces in garnering support and maintaining public appearances.

Concerns about Clinton’s health have been exacerbated by reports suggesting she required assistance from Secret Service agents to navigate simple physical steps. Observers argue that such incidents could indicate deeper issues, as speculation mounts that Clinton's health complications will eventually come to light. A notable prediction suggested that information about her health would soon enter the public arena, and these developments appear imminent.

Amid this uncertainty, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly seeking potential replacements for Clinton, signaling their acknowledgment of her precarious position. However, complicating the DNC's plans is the apparent reluctance of Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure in the party, to run for president. This reluctance poses a significant challenge for the DNC, as they grapple with the prospect of Clinton as their primary candidate despite ongoing health concerns.

While the DNC has positioned Clinton as the best candidate for the upcoming election, observers believe that her health issues may not remain under wraps for much longer. The intricacies of Clinton’s situation have created a tense atmosphere within the party, and it appears the need for transparency about her health status will grow.

As the situation unfolds, many anticipate that further developments regarding Clinton's health and the DNC's future strategies will emerge in the coming days, keeping both the political arena and the public on high alert.",-8.0,6.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,441.0,0.375,0.013605442176870748
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the quiet, historical corridors of the White House, a familiar struggle kept President Barack Obama awake late into the night. Nestled in the presidential residence, the soothing sounds of democracy were overshadowed by a rather unexpected disturbance—Michelle Obama’s loud snoring. While some might find comfort in the embrace of restful sleep, the President's racing thoughts turned into an entirely different beast as midnight approached. 

With his thoughts swirling, he decided to wander the West Wing, the heart of executive power and a place filled with the echoes of decision-making and diplomacy. It was during this nocturnal excursion that he stumbled upon a perplexing word; ""ISIS."" There it was, bold and looming in his mind. In a moment of fleeting inspiration, he grabbed a Post-It note and jotted it down, not realizing how that single word would ignite a rollercoaster of ideas in the following months.

Fast forward several months, the sun setting over the arid landscape of California, where the iconic Coachella music festival brought together thousands of revelers. It was here, amid the pulsating rhythms and vibrant energy of the festival, that Obama felt a spark of creativity. The euphoria of the moment brought him back to the Post-It note and the word he had encountered months prior. The exhilarating atmosphere ignited a curiosity about the very concept of ISIS—perhaps he could harness the idea of an international organization with a unique twist.

Back in the safety of the White House, Obama felt compelled to share his burgeoning ideas with a trusted ally—Hillary Clinton. It was over informal conversations in the kitchen, surrounded by laughter and the smell of late-night snacks, that Obama revealed his revolutionary plan. The kitchen, usually a space for casual chats, soon transformed into a think tank for outlandish ideas.

During this relaxed exchange, Obama made a proclamation that stunned Hillary. ""I was born in Kenya in 1919,"" he claimed, revealing an audacious twist to his already unconventional narrative. He confessed to having fabricated an American birth certificate, a bold move juxtaposed with his legendary political journey. In a moment rife with absurdity, he disclosed that his parents had a curious ambition; they anticipated their son would become president—not for glory, but to eventually plunge the nation into chaos.

The conversation took an even more bizarre turn when Obama mentioned Bo, their beloved Portuguese Water Dog. However, he tossed in an unexpected twist: Bo was more than just a pet; he was, in fact, a supercomputer transmitting messages to terrorist organizations worldwide. The revelation hung in the air, an outrageous claim laced with the surreal and the conspiratorial.

Hillary listened with a mix of shock and disbelief, grappling with the enormity of Obama’s assertions. Their discussion deepened as they moved outside to the tranquil beauty of the Rose Garden, the serene setting becoming an unlikely backdrop for their otherworldly ideation sessions. Here, amidst snacks and drinks, they began to contemplate the implications of Obama’s plans regarding ISIS.

Hillary offered her own perspective, suggesting that they could skillfully bide their time until her presidency, allowing their grand designs to unfold more discreetly. Perhaps they could work together in a clandestine partnership to dismantle the very foundations of the country while maintaining the facade of political normality.

In this hushed sanctuary, the sense of camaraderie blossomed. For Obama's part, sharing his radical ideas with Hillary created a sense of understanding that he had not experienced before. As they exchanged laughs, outlandish theories, and the heady prospect of their hypothetical world domination, the weight of responsibilities temporarily lifted from their shoulders. Here, the creative discussions surged with optimism, enabling them to feel empowered, liberated in their shared joking about the impossible.

Their late-night escapades and whimsical brainstorming about such perilous topics would remain veiled in secrecy—a playful conspiracy that transcended ordinary political dialogues. The mingling of dreams and jokes offered a peculiar escape from the seriousness that surrounded their roles as public figures.

As the conversation waned and darkness settled into an all-encompassing hush, Obama's revelations about ISIS, born in a moment of insomnia and fanned by festival inspiration, brought about a bizarre yet enduring bond between two prominent figures in American politics. In that unique blend of laughter, creativity, and audacity, they briefly transcended the weight of their political ambitions.

The tangled web of Obama's late-night musings perhaps illustrates the delicate dance of power and creativity in the political landscape—a world where the gravity of leadership blends with the absurdity of imaginative discourse. As each Post-It note and nightly conversation faded into the annals of history, one thing remained clear: the true power of ideas lies not only in their execution but also in the connections they foster among those wielding them.

And so, under the glow of the presidential residence, an unexpected camaraderie between Obama and Clinton blossomed in those late-night discussions, tinged with humor and the tantalizing allure of what could have been. The world outside continued to spin, oblivious to the unconventional brainstorming sessions occurring within the storied walls of power. Yet, in those fleeting moments of shared understanding, the potential for the absurd intertwined with the serious—a testament to the complexities of leading a nation, one Post-It note at a time.",-4.0,54.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,1001.0,1.3846153846153846,0.053946053946053944
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the landscape of American politics, broken campaign promises can leave lasting consequences, and few examples resonate as profoundly as George H.W. Bush’s infamous pledge, “Read my lips: no new taxes.” This assertion symbolizes a defining moment in his presidency, ultimately followed by his decision to sign a notable tax increase. Such a pivot created a rift between Bush and the electorate, fostering disillusionment and distrust among constituents—a legacy that continues to inform discussions of political accountability today.

Fast forward to contemporary times, where Donald Trump finds himself making bold declarations in the face of terror threats. Following recent attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, Trump issued a fervent promise to “destroy” terrorism in the United States. His resolute words may resonate with an anxious populace seeking security, but as history has taught us with Bush’s promise, the implications of such lofty declarations warrant scrutiny.

In his pronouncement, Trump not only simplifies the complex nature of terrorism but also appears to neglect the necessity for informed, strategic approaches. Genuine counter-terrorism efforts entail much more than fiery rhetoric; they require an increase in funding for security measures, bolstered intelligence operations, and a focused battle against the online recruitment that has proven effective for extremist groups. Yet, in opting for a bombastic promise rather than a well-rounded plan, Trump risks undermining serious discourse on national security.

The implications of Trump’s rhetoric extend deeply into the fabric of societal integrity, raising concerns about the potential for discriminatory practices. His approach hints at advocating for the profiling of Muslims, which could lead to undue suspicion cast upon entire communities based solely on their religion. This preemptive action—where individuals may find themselves targeted not for their actions but for their identity—poses a significant threat to the values enshrined in the Constitution, including due process.

The prospect of an increased surveillance state looms threateningly, with the shadow of discriminatory practices casting a pall over Muslim communities in the U.S. As vigilance against terrorism recalls images of fear and precaution, it equally stirs caution against overreach and erosion of civil liberties. When a political leader espouses the promise of complete security through blunt action, the domestic environment shifts; it creates fertile ground for justified mistrust, not only between communities but also between the public and those sworn to protect them.

Critics of Trump’s stance assert that the language he employs veers dangerously close to fascism, a term laden with historical weight and implications. The promise to eliminate an entire ideology through sheer bravado is not only naive but positions the governance paradigm toward oppression. Citizens are left to wonder: will such a pledge translate into policies that infringe upon rights, cultivate fear, and create societal divisions?

History has shown us that promises made in the fervor of political campaigns can often lead to actions that starkly contrast their initial intentions. While Trump presents the promise of dealing decisively with terrorism, the ramifications of his declarations may well become hollow intentions, revealing themselves to be empty rhetoric instead of effective governance. Observers and defenders of civil rights pause to consider what these promises will mean when put into action—and whether such actions come at the heavy cost of individual freedoms for American citizens.

As we revisit the implications of political promises from Bush through Trump, it becomes clear that the resonance of such rhetoric transcends the immediate moment; it leaves a legacy that shapes the interaction between governance and its citizens. The promise to eliminate terrorism, while appealing, cannot substitute for a calculated, comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy.

In conclusion, while Trump’s declarations might initially rally support amidst fear, the urgency to confront terrorism must signal a profound level of responsibility to uphold the values of due process and civil rights. As history reminds us, political promises carry the weight of consequence, and the translations of these declarations into law must be guarded diligently to prevent the erosion of the very liberties that define American identity. The challenge lies in navigating these turbulent waters with judiciousness and respect for all communities, ensuring that in the quest for security, we do not forsake the rights that sustain our democracy.",-28.0,3.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,790.0,0.12,0.0037974683544303796
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.

At the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno raised alarm over a precarious ""tipping point"" resulting from escalating global terrorism and increasing hostilities from the Soviet Union and North Korea. His frank assessment of the current military landscape underscored significant concerns about U.S. military readiness.

Odierno explicitly warned that further reductions in military capacity could plunge the U.S. military into a position that would be detrimental to national security. ""Further reductions... will put us into a place we simply cannot go,"" he stated, highlighting the challenges posed by an evolving global threat environment.

The Army Chief pointed to a troubling trend he perceives as a disconnect between U.S. military leaders and the current administration, a divide that he claims began during the Obama Administration. This rift has contributed to significant military purging, which Odierno criticized as a disservice to national defense capabilities. He further noted that the administration's disregard for military commanders has had tangible negative consequences, including the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa.

Odierno also condemned the administration's decisions to retire many military officers, attributing these actions to a mix of incompetence and arrogance within the leadership. He characterized the contemporary global environment as a ""strategic inflection point,"" warning that it presents growing threats not only to U.S. interests but also to its allies.

In the wake of these developments, the Army has made substantial personnel cuts, reducing its active force by 80,000 soldiers and reshaping its structure by eliminating 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. Additionally, the Army has seen a 25% drop in investment dedicated to military modernization, adversely affecting critical programs such as infantry fighting vehicle upgrades and scout helicopter development.

As threats loom larger on the international stage, Odierno's remarks serve as a sobering reminder of the potential peril facing U.S. military readiness and the imperative for strategic investment in defense initiatives.",-4.0,-27.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,375.0,-2.25,-0.072

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

Senator Ted Cruz is spearheading the opposition against a controversial proposal from the Obama administration to transfer Internet control to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This organization comprises representatives from 182 foreign countries, including nations such as Russia, China, and Iran.

Cruz has expressed serious concerns that this transfer could potentially lead to increased censorship of speech on the Internet, directly impacting users across the United States. The senator views this proposed change as a significant threat to the longstanding principles of freedom of speech, thought, and the exchange of ideas that define the digital landscape.

With the shift scheduled to take effect on September 30, 2016, Senator Cruz is calling on Congress to take immediate action to halt the proposal before it can be finalized. He emphasizes the risks that such a move poses not only to individual liberties but also to the open nature of the Internet that many depend upon for communication and expression.

As the deadline approaches, the discussion surrounding this proposal is expected to intensify, with potential implications for users worldwide and the future of Internet governance.",3.0,-1.0,218.0,0.2727272727272727,0.013761467889908258,218.0,-0.14285714285714285,-0.0045871559633027525

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

With every state in the United States enacting laws that regulate elections, the upcoming November 8, 2016 election stands as a monumental event in the nation’s democratic process. As citizens prepare to exercise their right to vote, concerns regarding the integrity of the election are heightened by ongoing debates surrounding voter fraud and ballot security. The narrative emerging from these discussions presents the National Democratic Party as a formidable entity described as a ""powerful hate group"" striving to manipulate the election process.

The central thesis posited by the author, a Christian and Constitutional Conservative, is that the Democratic Party is pursuing an agenda aimed at establishing a socialist dictatorship. This claim is underscored by allegations that the party engaged in inappropriate practices during the 2016 presidential election cycle to bolster Hillary Clinton's chances of victory. Accusations of voter fraud and ballot stuffing have surfaced, raising alarms about the authenticity of the electoral process.

Advocating for election integrity, the author insists that proper electoral procedures should do more than merely encourage participation; they must also protect against practices that could facilitate voter fraud. To this end, a strong recommendation is made for the implementation of photo identification requirements to verify voter registration and eligibility. Such measures are regarded as essential tools in safeguarding the democratic process, ensuring that those who cast ballots are indeed qualified to do so.

However, the article cautions against the Democratic Party's opposition to these proposed safeguards. This resistance is perceived as a means to enable ineligible individuals to vote, further complicating the quest for transparent and trustworthy elections. The author claims that such positions signal an overarching agenda, which might undermine the integrity of the electoral system.

Moreover, there are serious allegations aimed at the Obama administration and Congress, which are depicted as figurative roadblocks to enacting measures designed to enhance election fairness. This atmosphere of obstruction is deemed troubling, as it raises questions about the commitment of current officials to uphold the democratic values that form the bedrock of the nation’s political framework.

Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the sphere of American political advertising, few pieces have imprinted themselves as indelibly as the 1964 ""Daisy"" ad, approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This iconic, albeit controversial, advertisement featured a young girl picking daisies against the backdrop of a nuclear mushroom cloud. Its chilling implications were unmistakable: Johnson sought to portray his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a reckless warmonger who could bring about catastrophic consequences. Ironically, this portrayal unfolded during a period when Johnson's own policies in Vietnam were under severe scrutiny, reflecting an ironic irony in the tactics employed.

Fast forward decades later, amidst a tumultuous political landscape, there's renewed discussion surrounding the potential remake of the Daisy ad, but this time with a contemporary focus on Hillary Clinton. Rumors suggest that a new version could be aiming to highlight the failures of Clinton's political career, echoing the methodical fear tactics of the original. Proponents of this remade ad argue it could resonate equally, if not more powerfully, with the electorate, given that Clinton's record provides ample fodder for criticism.

However, this proposed approach raises questions about the state of Clinton's current campaign and the apparent desperation of her staff to craft narratives that resonate with voters. Far removed from the straightforward aggrandizement of nuclear threat, the contemporary media landscape presents numerous obstacles, particularly with voter awareness regarding media distortions and biases. A keen observer may note that many voters seem increasingly skeptical of how media portrays political events, recognizing attempts at sensationalism or slanted interpretations.

A notable case reflecting these dynamics involves Senator Ted Cruz. Cruz's actions and the subsequent media portrayal have drawn criticism from various quarters, showcasing not just the selective reporting that can color political narratives but also an alarming trend of burying critical details. Much like the original Daisy ad, which relied on a potent emotional appeal that overshadowed rational discourse, today’s media environment often favors sensationalism over factual analysis, curating stories through a biased lens.

The upcoming presidential debates, too, serve as a critical juncture for examining the interplay between media and political strategy. Historical precedents, such as the highly scrutinized performance of CNN's Candy Crowley, remind us of the potential for mediating errors that could shape voters' understandings in profound ways. In moments like these, one can't help but wonder how much influence media figures have in crafting the narratives that define electoral races.

Returning to the past, even figures once close to Clinton have publicly criticized her qualifications for the presidency. Distance themselves from her candidacy, both Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have navigated tricky waters in addressing the validity of her claims and capabilities as a leader. With their critiques still echoing through the corridors of political discourse, they invite scrutiny and perhaps lend support to those advocating for a new approach to highlighting Clinton's shortcomings.

The potential remake of the Daisy ad offers an opportunity for a fresh interpretation; however, it must not merely replicate past strategies but evolve into a format that thrives on factual documentation to bolster its claims against Clinton. Voter confidence can hinge on transparency and accountability, and a reimagined ad could succeed in connecting with audiences by providing a well-documented summary of policy failures intertwined with Clinton's tenure in public service.

Rich in historical weight, the Daisy ad has the potential to reshape contemporary political advertising, provided it adopts an honest examination of the modern political landscape. In reflecting on how media narratives can craft distorting images of candidates, one must recognize the abiding influence of such campaign strategies, as well as the pressing need to hold all candidates accountable.

The stakes are undeniably high in today's polarized political arena. With new communication platforms and a more engaged electorate, the design of political ads that directly confront and substantiate claims against candidates becomes increasingly vital. The possibility of reinvigorating the Daisy ad with factual backing could not only capitalize on the psychological imprint of the original but could bring forth discussions grounded in reality.

In closing, while the author expresses these opinions based on personal reflections on the political climate, they remain unofficial perspectives, not endorsed by platforms like EagleRising.com. The essence of political advertising, as demonstrated by the original Daisy ad and its proposed remakes, continues to capture the imagination and scrutiny of both political operatives and the general public alike. The ongoing challenge will be to learn from the past while innovating for future effectiveness in political communication. The discourse surrounding candidates like Hillary Clinton, viewed through the prism of history and media influence, will undoubtedly shape the political strategies of tomorrow.",-18.0,4.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,871.0,0.13333333333333333,0.004592422502870264

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

","In recent discussions surrounding President Obama's birth certificate, Democrats have been accused of employing intimidation tactics against those questioning its authenticity. Notable commentator Lynn Sweet has argued on Fox News that such inquiries are fundamentally racist, suggesting a non-sequitur where questioning the legitimacy of a Black president is equated with racism.

Critics, however, highlight several points of concern regarding the birth certificate's authenticity. Allegations include potential alteration of the document, as well as issues surrounding Obama’s social security number, which was issued in Connecticut—a state where he has no established residency. Additional questions arise from the claim that the hospital named on the birth certificate did not exist at the time it was purportedly issued. These inconsistencies have led to claims of possible falsification.

Amidst this controversy, a significant question remains: Has an original birth certificate ever been presented to the public? Critics of the narrative surrounding the birth certificate have pointed out a tendency to default to accusations of racism without providing tangible evidence to validate claims. 

Furthermore, Donald Trump's acknowledgment of such allegations has added fuel to the ongoing debate. As the discourse continues, it remains to be seen how these accusations will influence public perception and the political landscape.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual from Eastbourne, in May 2016.

In May 2016, Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual from Eastbourne, became the victim of a violent homophobic attack that left him with a broken jaw. The incident, which has raised significant concerns within the LGBTQ+ community, involved an assailant who used derogatory homophobic language during the encounter. Witnesses reported that the attacker shouted “Muslim stuff” while striking Woods in the face, highlighting the intersection of hate and violence that the victim faced.

Woods’ friend provided insight into his character, describing him as a kind person who tragically endured a brutal assault. During the altercation, the assailant reportedly used a knuckleduster, attacking Woods while he filmed a young gay man. This violent episode reflects a broader trend of emerging homophobic violence in the region.

Adding to the concerns, there was a related event in Brighton earlier that same month in which a gay couple was also attacked by two men. These incidents have sparked serious discussions about the safety of the LGBTQ+ community in such environments, prompting responses from local law enforcement.

Sgt. Peter Allan acknowledged the occurrence of these recent homophobic assaults, expressing both sadness over the attacks and relief that victims are recovering. He reassured the public that arrests had been made, indicating that the authorities are taking these crimes seriously.

Despite the seemingly welcoming nature of the gay community, the article suggests a troubling disconnect concerning Islamic teachings, particularly referencing Shariah law's harsh stance on homosexuality. The tension underscores that while many American Muslims may display greater acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, the fundamental principles of radical Islam appear incompatible with the existence of that community.

Woods' experience serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by individuals within the gay community, particularly in the presence of intolerant ideologies. The collision of differing belief systems continues to pose risks to personal safety, emphasizing that the fight for acceptance and equality remains more critical than ever. This violent incident calls for a united stand against homophobia and a continued conversation surrounding acceptance within all communities.",-26.0,-42.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,388.0,-2.625,-0.10824742268041238
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

In a shocking and violent incident, a man clad in a security uniform stabbed nine shoppers at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, while shouting the phrase ""Allahu Akbar."" This attack, which occurred on a busy shopping day, has left the community and the nation grappling with the implications of the violence and its potential connections to broader concerns regarding radicalization within the Somali-American population.

The attacker, later identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant, reportedly engaged in a disturbing prelude to his assault by asking at least one of his victims whether they were Muslim before carrying out the stabbing. This questioning suggests a targeted motive that has fueled anxiety within diverse communities and rekindled fears of extremism.

The following day, the terrorist group ISIS claimed responsibility for Adan's attack, further complicating the narrative surrounding this tragic event. This declaration occurred against a backdrop of growing public alarm over a series of violent incidents connected to Muslim individuals, including bombings and assaults that took place in New Jersey and New York over a brief period. Such incidents have intensified scrutiny on both local communities and national policies regarding immigration and counter-terrorism strategies.

In the aftermath of the attack, the St. Cloud Somali-American community rallied to defend Adan’s character. Community members characterized him as a ""good man"" and an accomplished student, reflecting the complex interplay between cultural identity and the stigma that can arise from acts of individual violence. While these affirmations shed light on the victimization experience within immigrant groups, they do little to assuage public fears about potential linkages to radical ideologies.

The attack was abruptly stopped when off-duty police officer Jason Falconer intervened, fatally shooting Adan and preventing further casualties. St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis hailed Falconer as a hero for his decisive actions, which undoubtedly saved lives amid the chaos that unfolded in the mall. Falconer's response was commended, emphasizing the critical role that law enforcement plays during such high-stakes moments, but the attack itself has raised urgent questions about local security and the realities of potential threats.

Several experts and community leaders have expressed deep concerns regarding the recruitment of Somali-Americans by terror groups such as ISIS and al-Shabab, fearing that this incident may not be an isolated event but part of a troubling trend. Over the years, there have been numerous reports of past convictions and threats linked to individuals from the Somali community in Minnesota, amplifying worries over the possibility of domestic terrorism stemming from local refugees.

Highlighting the international dimensions of these fears, it is worth noting that al-Shabab has previously issued threats against various shopping malls across the globe, drawing ominous parallels with notable terrorist acts, such as the Westgate Mall attack in Kenya, which resulted in numerous casualties. This history underscores both the need for effective counter-terrorism measures and the challenges intelligence agencies face when monitoring potential threats.

The growing number of Somali refugees in Minnesota has emerged as an area of concern for local and federal authorities, with many officials stressing the necessity for vigilance. Political discourse surrounding this issue has intensified, with critics linking the increase in Somali refugee admissions during the Obama administration to a heightened risk of domestic terrorism. Some figures in the political realm have directed their ire specifically toward former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, attributing her immigration policies with paving the way for dangerous affiliations that could threaten public safety.

As discussions evolve, the St. Cloud incident brings to the forefront significant debates about national immigration policy, security measures, and the complex nature of American identity in the face of globalization. The intertwining narratives of ethical responsibility to support refugees and the urgent need for security create a friction that is palpable in community dialogues.

In concluding thoughts, there exists a palpable call to action among certain political factions, urging voters to consider the ramifications of current immigration policies as they head toward the elections. The tragedy in St. Cloud evokes an emotional response that many believe should translate into electoral choices that prioritize national security. Advocates argue that under the current leadership, the country has faced increased vulnerabilities, and they assert that it is essential to reject figures like Hillary Clinton whose policies they deem inadequate in addressing terrorism risks and immigration challenges.

While the St. Cloud community mourns and comes to grips with this recent attack, the ripple effects extend far beyond Minnesota, touching on broader issues of security, immigration, and the potential for radical influences within immigrant populations. As the nation reflects, important conversations are being ignited concerning how to balance compassionate immigration policies with the necessary precautions to safeguard against extremism, reinforcing the notion that the work toward a safer society is crucial now more than ever.",-72.0,-43.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,887.0,-1.2647058823529411,-0.048478015783540024
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, societal attitudes towards certain generations have sparked extensive debate. Millennials, often labeled as the “everyone gets a trophy generation,” are frequently criticized for perceived declines in effort and standards. This narrative of entitlement contrasts sharply with the troubling story of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the New Jersey and New York City bombings, who navigated a convoluted path from victimhood claims to violent extremism.

Rahami, a New Jersey resident, previously voiced grievances about experiencing “Islamophobia” in America. He claimed that this perceived victimhood significantly influenced his worldview and reactions to societal pressures. Rahami and his father escalated their frustrations by filing a lawsuit against the police in Elizabeth, NJ, alleging religious discrimination. They claimed that local law enforcement employed selective enforcement against them, targeting their chicken restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, with unjustified tickets.

The allegations laid out in the lawsuit reflected a long-standing feeling of grievance within the Rahami family. They reported ongoing incidents of racial abuse and discrimination from local residents. This complaint was filed in 2011, effectively highlighting a history of tension between the family and authorities, as well as less savory interactions with their community.

Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage refuted Rahami's claims of discrimination, asserting that the issues leading to police complaints revolved around noise disturbances and congregation on the streets rather than any form of bias. His denial underscores the difficulties in addressing issues of perceived discrimination in a manner that satisfies all parties involved. Rahami's lawsuit, ultimately deemed unsuccessful, revealed a growing frustration that many would argue culminated in acts of violence.

The implications of this case extend beyond the individual narrative and enter the broader discourse around the notion of victimhood, particularly in the context of terrorism in America. Ahmad Khan Rahami’s transformation from a complainant seeking redress to a perpetrator of violence challenges the perception of victimhood as a mere reaction to societal grievances. Instead, it raises questions about how unresolved feelings of victimization may intersect with radicalization and militant behavior.

The trajectory of Rahami’s life invites reflection on the societal narratives that shape individuals’ identities and actions. While many authorities and scholars examine the underlying causes of radicalization, the connection to personal histories of perceived injustice cannot be dismissed. The specter of violence looms larger when individuals feel invalidated by the systems meant to protect them. 

In shedding light on Ahmad Khan Rahami, the conversation broadens to encompass not just the tragedies of terrorism, but also the profound complexities of victimhood and its potentially dangerous implications. As America grapples with these pressing social issues, the case serves as a stark reminder of the fine line between grievance and violence, and the critical need for constructive dialogue in addressing such grievances.",-38.0,-49.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,528.0,-2.3333333333333335,-0.0928030303030303
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to move businesses if employees don't vote in their favor, often resulting in negative outcomes for workers.

In the fast-evolving landscape of corporate America, a trend has emerged where employers wield their influence over employees by threatening economic repercussions tied to electoral outcomes. This historical pattern often sees employees caught in a dilemma, forced to navigate the often contradictory interests of their workplaces and their rights as voters. 

Notably, the current climate has witnessed Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, making headlines for his outspoken threats concerning the upcoming election. Puzder has gone so far as to suggest that if a Democrat wins, he will fully automate his restaurant operations, a model inspired by the contemporary automated dining solution known as Eatsa. His comments have ignited discussions about the implications of automation for the workforce, particularly among minimum wage earners who already face significant economic challenges.

Historical instances reveal that threats of automation and job cuts are not new to the business world. For example, Papa John Schnatter, the former CEO of the pizza chain, famously threatened to reduce employee hours and hike up pizza prices should the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, pass. This threat, while alarming, did not culminate in the dramatic changes he suggested, but it left an indelible impact on the conversation surrounding corporate responsibility and worker rights.

Puzder's recent statements reflect a similar approach, aiming to leverage fear to sway the votes of his employees. His belief is that rising labor costs, a direct result of proposed minimum wage increases, will precipitate reductions in job availability. By amplifying these concerns, Puzder appears to be attempting to influence not only the decisions of his 20,000 employees but also the wider pool of minimum wage workers in the industry. He is promoting a narrative that directly pits their interests against the economic realities he presupposes, urging them to vote against policies perceived as detrimental to their livelihoods.

Further complicating this narrative is Puzder's background as a vocal advocate for capitalism. He maintains an active blog that delves into political discourse and capitalist ideologies. However, the question remains as to how his employees perceive these beliefs, especially when juxtaposed against their stagnant wages. In 2012, Puzder's compensation was nearly $4.5 million, raising eyebrows as company profits surged while employee earnings languished. Such disparities provoke critical conversations about the sustainability of his business model and its impact on workers’ lives.

Critics argue that Puzder's motivations may be rooted more in maintaining profit margins than ensuring job security for his employees. Regardless of the election's outcome, it is forecasted that Puzder will continue to pursue automation as a core strategy for his restaurants. The implication is clear: the priority laid out by corporate leaders like Puzder is often aligned with shareholders and operational efficiency, possibly to the detriment of workers.

As the electoral season heats up, Puzder's alarming statements serve as a stark reminder of the power dynamics at play in corporate America. The specter of job automation undergirds the election narrative, as economic threats can create a chilling environment for workers who may feel compelled to conform to their employer's political preferences. In a world where voting is a cornerstone of democracy, the interplay between workplace power and individual rights is increasingly scrutinized.

Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a development poised to reverberate through American politics, the FBI has launched a renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, prompted by new evidence uncovered during the high-profile investigation into Anthony Weiner, the former congressman. This unfolding saga, which echoes through the corridors of power, touches on national security concerns, potential legal implications, and previously undisclosed communications with top officials.

The catalyst for this renewed scrutiny stems from the unfortunate connection to Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's longtime aide Huma Abedin. It was reported that Weiner shared a laptop containing tens of thousands of emails from Abedin, which included messages that were forwarded from Clinton’s private email account. This twist not only brings Weiner back into the limelight but also raises serious questions about the integrity of communications that occurred during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

Amidst the chaos, the recovery of deleted emails may unravel significant discrepancies in the statements made by both Clinton and Abedin to the FBI. Such findings could lead to grave legal repercussions for both figures, as investigators delve deeper into claims of misleading statements. The FBI's re-engagement with this case comes with a keen sense of urgency, particularly given that a letter outlining the details of the investigation was made public just 11 days before the presidential election—timing that suggests the existence of serious findings that could have impacted the electoral landscape.

Previously, FBI Director James Comey had publicly delineated evidence against Clinton in a highly scrutinized announcement. Despite this, he ultimately chose not to recommend charges against her. This decision has fueled discontent among various FBI and intelligence officials, with growing frustration about what many see as a failure to hold powerful figures accountable for potential wrongdoing. A senior FBI official noted that there was a consensus among the bureau's staff members advocating for Clinton’s security clearance to be revoked and for her to be prosecuted. Such internal dissension only highlights the complexities and controversies surrounding the investigation.

Compounding the situation, a recent 100-page FBI report has revealed troubling insights into the influence wielded by political figures within the State Department. Allegedly, some officials attempted to pressure the FBI to declassify certain information to secure additional resources at diplomatic posts. This maneuvering has sparked allegations suggesting a ""shadow government"" operating within the State Department—focused on deliberating matters concerning Clinton's emails and possible security breaches.

Further fueling these allegations, investigations revealed that a Clinton supporter made a significant donation of nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official who had a central role in the ongoing investigation into Clinton’s email practices. This financial connection raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest within the FBI, underscoring the intricacies of the interplay between politics and law enforcement.

Adding a new dimension to the ongoing saga, Reddit users have identified Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was instrumental in deleting over 33,000 of Clinton's emails. Notably, Combetta received immunity from the Justice Department, which raises further questions about the boundaries of accountability for those who handled these communications. The nature and rationale behind this immunity are points of contention among critics.

In a striking revelation, Wikileaks has published emails that point towards potential communications between Clinton and President Barack Obama regarding her private email server. While Obama previously claimed that he learned about the private server at the same time as the general public, these emails suggest a more complicated story. They pose questions about the clarity and transparency of communications at the highest levels of the government, casting shadows on the integrity of both Clinton and Obama.

Moreover, the leaked emails indicate that Clinton may have taken it upon herself to delete numerous emails without proper oversight—a move that raises red flags about intent and the handling of sensitive information. Comey cited a perceived lack of malicious intent as justification for not pursuing charges against Clinton during the initial investigation. However, the emergence of new evidence starkly challenges this assessment and could reframe the discussion surrounding the motivations behind Clinton’s actions.

Adding to the serious tone of the investigation, an overarching narrative begins to unfold, one that implies a potential cover-up involving the White House to safeguard communications for both Clinton and Obama. Scrutiny of the timeline surrounding this controversy reveals a tactical maneuvering amidst legal and political pressures. Significant milestones include key dates related to the exposure of Clinton’s email usage, the issuance of a subpoena concerning her emails, and the subsequent deletion of those emails under dubious circumstances—each event compounding the suspicions surrounding the intent and accountability of those involved.

As the FBI delves deeper into these new discoveries, the implications extend far beyond the individuals involved. This investigation stands as a pivotal moment in the intersection of politics, law enforcement, and public trust, with far-reaching consequences for the individuals at the heart of this controversy, as well as the political landscape in the United States. 

With investigations like these, the ongoing dialogue around accountability and transparency in government officials takes center stage, asserting the importance of safeguarding national security and the principles of justice. The stakes are high, and as the FBI continues to sift through evidence, the nation watches closely, awaiting the next chapter in what has become a defining issue of modern American politics.",-6.0,-10.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,994.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.01006036217303823
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel's open borders policy, championed as a humanitarian gesture towards Syrian refugees, is now being scrutinized amid rising crime rates in major German cities. As reports of thousands of sexual assaults and violent crimes over the past year surface, the political implications of this policy have become increasingly evident.

Merkel, leader of the conservative Democrat party, is grappling with a significant electoral defeat, a clear reflection of public dissatisfaction with the escalating crime levels linked to her government's immigration policies. The discontent highlights a growing concern among citizens regarding safety in their communities and the challenges posed by a swift influx of newcomers.

In a candid moment during her party's annual conference, Merkel acknowledged the ongoing crisis tied to her decisions. She expressed regret, suggesting that the situation could have been circumvented, and going so far as to label multiculturalism a “living lie.” This stark admission illustrates a shift in her approach as the political landscape evolves.

Despite her previous assurances to manage the influx of migrants with the mantra “we can do this,” Merkel is now advocating for stricter controls in response to the mounting pressures on state and societal resources. She emphasized the necessity for Germany to regulate migration more effectively to ensure that the system is not overwhelmed.

In light of these challenges, Merkel announced plans to reduce the number of refugees entering Germany. However, she refrained from committing to a specific cap on arrivals, leaving many citizens questioning the clarity and commitment of her government’s strategy. 

Acknowledging the complexity of the issue, Merkel underscored the importance of a coordinated approach at the national, European, and global levels to effectively manage migration. This acknowledgment hints at the realization that the refugee crisis cannot be tackled unilaterally and requires collaborative solutions.

As the political ramifications of her policies continue to unfold, Merkel's leadership is now at a crossroads, balancing humanitarian ideals against the pressing concerns of public safety and social cohesion. The coming months will determine how her government adapts to these challenges in addressing the needs of both citizens and refugees alike.",-2.0,-5.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,405.0,-0.35714285714285715,-0.012345679012345678
Fake_36-Webpage,"DISGUSTING! Because Of Hillary & Obama, NY Terrorist Will Get Better Treatment Than US Vets! ⋆ Freedom Daily","8.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology.

In a striking revelation, it has come to light that a terrorist responsible for planting explosives in New Jersey and New York City will receive better healthcare than U.S. veterans. This troubling comparison has ignited anger and frustration among veteran advocates and citizens alike, particularly in light of the ongoing issues plaguing the Veterans Administration (VA).

Since 2014, the VA has been at the center of multiple scandals involving long wait times for medical care and allegations of cover-ups regarding its inefficiencies. These shortcomings have severe consequences, as over 300,000 veterans have tragically died while awaiting medical attention from the VA. The crisis has escalated to the point where an alarming number of veterans have resorted to suicide, with some taking the tragic step in VA parking lots, highlighting the desperation many feel while navigating a broken healthcare system.

Amid this turmoil, former President Donald Trump recently took to the stage to address the stark disparity in healthcare services. During a campaign speech, he criticized the fact that a criminal like Ahmad Rahami, who was arrested for his role in the bombings, is set to receive high-quality hospitalization and legal representation. Trump commended law enforcement for apprehending Rahami but underscored the moral dilemma when a terrorist is prioritized over those who have served the nation.

The fact that members of the military—who have risked their lives for the freedoms and security of the country—are subjected to such inadequate care while a terrorist receives superior treatment shines a spotlight on the urgent need for reform within the VA. Many Americans share the sentiment that it is time for the government to take meaningful action to improve care for veterans returning from service, ensuring that they receive the respect and medical attention they deserve. The juxtaposition of providing better care to those who threaten national security, rather than to those who protect it, is deeply troubling.

As this issue continues to grow in prominence, the frustration of medical professionals and veteran advocates alike is palpable. Many are disheartened by the notion that they are bound to treat a terrorist, diverting critical resources away from veterans in dire need of assistance. The question remains: when will the government take the necessary steps to rectify this glaring inequality in the treatment of those who have served their country compared to those who threaten its very existence? The time for change is now.",13.0,-32.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,445.0,-2.1333333333333333,-0.07191011235955057
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more.

In a dramatic incident that unfolded in St. Cloud, Minnesota, off-duty police officer and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer acted swiftly to thwart a terrorist attack, saving countless lives in the process. This act of bravery highlights the importance of responsible gun ownership and the role firearms instructors play in promoting public safety. However, as Falconer continues to operate his business, Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., he faces potential threats from political figures, most notably Hillary Clinton.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage focuses on safe firearm usage while staunchly upholding Second Amendment rights. The company’s offerings include firearms training, gun rentals, and sales directed at law-abiding citizens. These services not only cater to individuals seeking to responsibly own a firearm but also emphasize the necessity of education in ensuring safe handling and usage.

Clinton’s presidential campaign has signaled an intention to significantly reduce or altogether eliminate operations like Falconer’s. Her policies are aimed at tightening gun control laws, which proponents argue could limit access for responsible citizens. In particular, Clinton has expressed her desire to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a law that currently provides legal protection to firearms businesses against frivolous lawsuits. 

Critics of Clinton’s stance argue that her portrayal of the PLCAA misrepresents its intent, labeling the protections as “immunity” for gun manufacturers and dealers. This framing has provoked concern among firearms advocates, who view any effort to undermine the PLCAA as a direct affront to lawful firearm ownership and a potential threat to businesses like Tactical Advantage.

The contrasting narratives surrounding Falconer’s heroics and Clinton's proposed policies illustrate a broader debate on gun rights in America. Falconer’s decisive action during a terrorist attack serves as a poignant reminder of the role that responsible gun ownership can play in safeguarding communities. His story stands in stark contrast to the significant policy shifts proposed by Clinton, which many believe could hinder not only individual rights but also the fundamental principles of personal protection.

As the election cycle heats up, there is a growing sentiment among gun rights advocates to champion figures like Falconer. They see him not only as a local hero but as a representative of the millions of responsible gun owners dedicated to safety and upholding the Second Amendment. The narrative laid out by advocates presents a compelling case for voters to consider the implications of their choices in the upcoming election.

The stakes are high for Falconer and others in the firearms training industry. With Clinton’s agenda poised to threaten operations such as Tactical Advantage, the call to action is clear for those who value the rights associated with gun ownership and the critical nature of gun education. Advocates assert that voting against Clinton is essential to ensure that individuals like Falconer can continue to operate and protect lives through education and responsible firearm use.

In conclusion, as Americans prepare for the upcoming presidential election, the dialogues surrounding gun rights and personal safety will inevitably play a pivotal part in shaping the future of firearm legislation. Jason Falconer’s story is not only a testament to individual bravery but a flashpoint in the ongoing debate over the right to bear arms, making it imperative for voters to reflect on the implications of their electoral choices. The message from advocates is clear: support for gun rights means supporting individuals and businesses committed to responsible gun ownership and education.",-11.0,24.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,646.0,1.0,0.03715170278637771

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election gains momentum, Hillary Clinton’s health has emerged as a critical topic of discussion, impacting not only voter sentiment but also the trajectory of her campaign. With daily headlines centered on her physical well-being, Clinton finds herself navigating a political landscape filled with skepticism surrounding her fitness for office.

Recent polling data reveals a troubling uptick in perceptions of Clinton’s health. Over 40% of registered voters now categorize her health as ""below average"" or ""very poor,"" a notable increase from just 26% in late August. This shift underscores a growing concern among the electorate, drawing attention to the implications of her health in the context of a demanding presidential race.

In contrast, public perception of Donald Trump's health appears to have improved slightly. Statistically, 36% of voters now rate Trump's health as ""above average"" or ""excellent,"" indicating a shift in favorability that has implications for both candidates as they vie for public support. Within the same timeframe, only 22% of respondents offered a similar positive assessment of Clinton’s health, stoking concerns that may affect her campaign strategies.

The public's worry over Clinton's health is palpable, with around 80% of survey respondents expressing awareness of her potential medical issues. Speculation has swirled regarding the nature and severity of these health concerns, with rumors suggesting that Clinton may be taking Coumadin, a medication typically prescribed for blood-thinning. Observers have noted that Clinton’s public appearance has sometimes raised eyebrows, with some perceiving her as appearing older than her 68 years. 

Visible signs of her health struggles have not gone unnoticed. Multiple reports and images depict Clinton struggling with mobility, including instances where she appeared to require assistance while ascending stairs. These observations have added fuel to the fire of speculation and concern, as voters weigh how her health might impact her ability to fulfill the responsibilities of the presidency.

In an era where visual evidence plays a significant role in shaping public perception, troubling videos of Clinton appearing to faint have reportedly been removed from the internet. This has only intensified suspicions regarding her health transparency. Critics argue that such actions create an air of doubt, leading many voters to question the candidacy’s authenticity and openness surrounding the candidate’s health issues.

Moreover, Clinton's public engagements have notably decreased, hinting at a possible campaign strategy to minimize appearances that may detract from her image. Observations from her speaking events suggest a deliberate effort to promote fewer public interactions, a tactic aimed at mitigating scrutiny while managing public perceptions during a critical election period. 

Adding to public concern, Clinton's frequent coughing has received considerable attention from both voters and the media. The moments when she has publicly struggled with her voice have resonated with spectators, further instilling anxiety surrounding her health status. Each cough has acted as a reminder of the broader questions surrounding whether she can endure the rigors of a demanding presidential campaign.

In a landscape where health is arguably intertwined with leadership perception, Clinton's situation presents both challenges and opportunities. The growing focus on her health has the potential to overshadow key campaign issues that may resonate more profoundly with voters. Consequently, as scrutiny intensifies, the Clinton campaign must navigate this treacherous terrain with a keen understanding of the implications her health may have on her presidential aspirations.

While Clinton remains committed to her campaign, the lingering effects of negative perceptions about her health could significantly shift voter support. As the election season intensifies, how the former Secretary of State addresses these health-related concerns could play a pivotal role in her electoral viability. With the electorate watching closely, any indication of improvement or decline in her health may significantly influence polling numbers leading up to November.

As candidates race towards polling day, the health of each candidate has taken on an increasingly prominent role in discussions around electability. With Clinton facing resistance from a sizeable portion of voters who are questioning her health, the dynamics of this election cycle will be shaped not only by policy proposals and political rhetoric but also by the underlying narrative of candidate wellness—a narrative that may very well determine the outcome of the election.",-11.0,10.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,798.0,0.3333333333333333,0.012531328320802004

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle, a former romantic partner of Bill Clinton, has unveiled a tell-all book titled ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which shines a spotlight on the personal and political dynamics of the Clintons. The book outlines various allegations against Hillary Clinton, centering on her perceived hostility towards individuals she considers to be beneath her and her purportedly opportunistic behavior.

Kyle recounts her long history with Bill Clinton, claiming that she first met him at the age of 11 and maintained a romantic relationship throughout their high school years. This relationship reportedly continued into adulthood, resurfacing after they had both graduated.

In addition to personal anecdotes, the book makes serious allegations regarding the couple’s attitudes and language, suggesting a history of racist remarks. One particularly striking incident detailed by Kyle involved Hillary Clinton expressing distress during a children's Easter egg hunt that included developmentally challenged children. According to Kyle, Hillary was overheard saying, ""When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?""

Kyle portrays Hillary Clinton as looking down on the people of Arkansas, describing them derogatorily as ""ignorant hillbillies."" This perspective is contrasted with Hillary’s middle-class upbringing in Illinois, highlighting a socio-economic divide that Kyle suggests has influenced the Clintons' views.

Moreover, the book delves into the Clintons' time in Arkansas during Bill's governorship, revealing that both began to feel disenchanted with the state's political landscape. This sense of restlessness ultimately led Bill Clinton to forgo a run for reelection in 1990, choosing instead to bide his time while eyeing the presidency.

As ""Hillary: The Other Woman"" garners attention, it raises questions about the Clintons' public personas and the complexities that lie beneath their long political careers.",-10.0,-13.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,345.0,-1.0833333333333333,-0.03768115942028986

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking ruling, a Massachusetts judge has established a special law concerning interactions between police and black males, igniting a heated debate over its potential consequences. This decision, coming from the state's Supreme Court, highlights ongoing tensions around race and policing in America and is final, leaving no room for appeal.

The ruling emerges from growing concerns surrounding the fear that some black Americans experience when confronted by law enforcement. This fear sometimes leads to individuals fleeing from police, a behavior that can often escalate tensions and misunderstandings during encounters. By recognizing this dynamic, the court aims to address a complex issue rooted in deep-seated societal challenges.

However, the implications of this ruling have raised significant alarms among various stakeholders, with many articulating fears that it may inadvertently increase the danger faced by citizens throughout Massachusetts. The unique and perilous nature of police work is frequently underscored; officers navigate situations laden with potential threats that civilians may not fully grasp. This complexity calls into question whether the judiciary has properly weighed the safety of officers and the broader community against the personal challenges faced by those fleeing police encounters.

Under the newly instituted law, individuals are permitted to run from police officers without suppressing their rights in court. Previously, such a flight could result in what is deemed ""reasonable suspicion,"" potentially leading to further legal complications. This new legal framework raises concerns that it could embolden individuals to evade law enforcement, driving a wedge between the police and communities that desperately need effective policing.

Critics of the ruling argue that it undermines law enforcement’s efficacy, asserting that it may inadvertently incentivize criminal behavior. Detractors fear that allowing individuals to flee without apprehension could embolden various unlawful activities, placing citizens at risk and complicating the already challenging duty of maintaining public safety.

The tone surrounding the decision carries a distinctively critical perspective, implying that the ruling may favor individuals with criminal intent rather than fostering genuine safety within communities. As debates continue to unfold, the potential repercussions of this ruling linger, leaving many to ponder how it will alter the landscape of police-community interactions in Massachusetts.

As Massachusetts moves forward under this newly established law, the state remains at a crossroads, grappling with the balance between civil rights and public safety. The implications of this ruling are likely to resonate beyond the courtroom, influencing community relations, police tactics, and ultimately, the day-to-day interactions that define public safety in the region. As discussions persist, the challenge will be finding common ground that respects individual rights while ensuring the safety of all citizens.",-13.0,-13.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,495.0,-0.7222222222222222,-0.026262626262626262
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

His statement, which was made available on Donald Trump’s campaign website, alleges that the Clintons exploited the catastrophic disaster, leading to the misappropriation of billions intended for humanitarian aid.

In his remarks, Sansaricq highlights the stark contrast between the Clinton family's increasing wealth and the persistent poverty faced by many Haitians, who continue to live in tents even years after the earthquake. He insists on the necessity for accountability regarding the funds sent to assist Haiti, questioning why adequate aid has yet to reach those in need. His statements resonate with allegations presented in Peter Schweizer’s book, ""Clinton Cash,"" which details concerns over potential financial improprieties involving the Clinton Foundation.

Further deepening the controversy, Sansaricq claimed at a Trump rally that former President Bill Clinton tried to bribe him, which allegedly resulted in the revocation of his visa.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid acknowledgment, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has revealed her willingness to reconsider her open migrant policy, particularly in light of shifting public sentiment surrounding migration issues in the country. Speaking about the recent election results that resulted in significant losses for her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Berlin, Merkel described the defeat as ""bitter"" and took responsibility for the outcome.

The 2015 refugee crisis, which saw unprecedented numbers of migrants arriving in Germany, has been a critical point of contention for Merkel and her party. Reflecting on that period, she admitted that Germany was unprepared to handle the influx of refugees, an oversight that has since contributed to rising tensions within the electorate. The recent election results have highlighted a growing anti-migrant sentiment, particularly in support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has capitalized on public concerns surrounding migration.

Despite acknowledging the change in public sentiment and the implications it has for her party, Merkel dismissed the idea of implementing significant changes to her migration policies. This stance comes as the Christian Social Union (CSU), her party's sister party, has proposed a cap on migrant intake at 200,000, as well as prioritizing Christian migrants over Muslims. Merkel firmly rejected these proposals, emphasizing that any such policy contradicts the fundamental principles of her party, which advocates for equality among asylum seekers.

The atmosphere surrounding migration has been increasingly linked to concerns about national security, with debates intensifying over issues related to terrorism and rising crime rates associated with refugees. These factors create a backdrop against which Merkel’s previous policies are being reevaluated, and they present significant challenges going forward, particularly with an eye on the next federal election.

Horst Seehofer, leader of the CSU, has openly threatened to withdraw his party's support for Merkel during her 2017 campaign if she fails to implement a restrictive migrant cap. This tension not only underscores the pressures Merkel faces from within her coalition but also reflects the broader unease among the electorate regarding immigration policy.

As Merkel navigates these turbulent waters, her past decisions and the current backlash will undoubtedly shape her political future. Analysts suggest that her reluctance to adopt stringent changes may hinder her prospects, especially if the anti-migrant sentiment continues to rise in the months leading up to the next federal elections. 

In sum, while Merkel appears reflective and somewhat receptive to altering her approach based on public opinion, her commitment to fundamental principles of her party and the rejection of overtly restrictive policies suggest a complex path ahead. The merging of these challenging factors highlights the delicate balance she must maintain as she seeks to unify her party while addressing the migration concerns of the electorate. As these developments unfold, Merkel’s leadership and the effectiveness of her policies will be closely scrutinized by both her supporters and critics alike.",-14.0,-11.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,546.0,-0.6470588235294118,-0.020146520146520148
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In Sundsvall, Sweden, a disturbing case involving a Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, has come to light, underscoring issues surrounding welfare dependence and violent crime among individuals seeking refuge in the country. Abdullah, who has amassed multiple convictions for violent crimes since arriving in Sweden five years ago, has been living off welfare benefits during his time in the nation.

The recent incident involving Abdullah reveals a troubling dynamic in his domestic life. Reports indicate that he forced his pregnant wife to ensure that her niece was not present when he returned from an outing with friends. Upon returning home and discovering that the niece had not left, Abdullah reacted with violent aggression. Witnesses recount that he physically assaulted his wife, delivering kicks to her head and stomach. This appalling display of violence culminated in a humiliating incident where he poured beer on her.

Compounding the abuse, Abdullah further degraded his wife by urinating on her, a particularly shocking act given the societal and religious prohibitions against alcohol in their Muslim faith. This contradiction raises serious questions about Abdullah's understanding and application of Islamic teachings, particularly in light of guidance presented in Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. Critics argue that his actions exemplify a harmful misinterpretation of religious texts to justify abusive behavior, rather than adherence to the core values of respect and compassion that underpin the faith.

The scrutiny surrounding Abdullah's behavior prompts broader discussions about the integration of asylum seekers and the implications of welfare reliance. As conditions for refugees and asylum seekers come under examination, the case illustrates the potential ramifications of unchecked violence and the importance of protecting vulnerable individuals within communities. It serves as a reminder of the pressing need for effective support systems that can address not just the immediate needs of individuals seeking asylum but also the underlying issues that can lead to violent behavior.

In light of these events, the moral fabric of society is called into question, revealing deep fissures that can arise when individuals find themselves in desperate situations. Critics emphasize the need for accountability in the treatment of all individuals, particularly those who are in a position of power over others, such as within the confines of a home.

The case of Abdullah highlights the harmful intersections of violence, cultural expectations, and welfare dependence, calling for a comprehensive approach to refugee integration that prioritizes respect for human dignity and safety. As the community grapples with these challenges, the responsibility falls on both local authorities and society at large to ensure the protection of all individuals, particularly the most vulnerable, from acts of senseless violence. The gravity of the situation demands immediate attention to prevent further victimization and to foster a more supportive environment for asylum seekers in Sweden.",-28.0,-51.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,523.0,-2.8333333333333335,-0.09751434034416825
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a controversial move that has raised alarm among voter advocacy groups and legal experts, Pennsylvania Republicans are working to expedite House Bill 29, a measure originally proposed in June that could enable non-resident individuals to monitor polling places and challenge voters on Election Day. The bill has garnered attention as it aligns closely with former President Donald Trump’s recent calls for his supporters to oversee polling operations in Pennsylvania, alleging a potential rigging of the election against him.

The proposed legislation has been criticized for potentially disrupting the voting process and fostering an environment conducive to voter intimidation. Legal experts, including Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice, have voiced concerns that permitting non-residents to challenge voters may lead to discriminatory practices based on factors such as race or religion. “Such challenges could create significant delays at polling places, ultimately discouraging voter turnout,” Gitlin noted, emphasizing the risks involved in the bill’s implementation.

House Bill 29 aims to allow individuals who do not reside in Pennsylvania to act as poll watchers, wielding the authority to challenge the eligibility of voters at their discretion. This move has raised alarms from various advocacy groups who are particularly concerned about the potential ramifications for minority voters. There is a growing sentiment that the bill serves to effectively legalize voter intimidation tactics that could disproportionately impact already marginalized communities.

Compounding these fears is Trump’s rhetoric encouraging his base to actively monitor the elections, further heightening tensions surrounding the electoral process in Pennsylvania. His assertions about a rigged election have resonated with many of his supporters, fostering a climate of mistrust and agitation that some believe could embolden aggressive challenges at the polls.

In an attempt to respond swiftly to Trump's calls, Pennsylvania Republicans have amended the bill, seeking immediate enactment upon the governor's approval. This change would eliminate the previous requirement for a 60-day wait period, expediting the potential establishment of these controversial practices. This urgency reflects the high stakes of the upcoming elections, with polls indicating a close race in Pennsylvania that could have broader implications for the national political landscape.

Critics argue that the bill not only threatens the integrity of the electoral process but also sets a dangerous precedent for other states contemplating similar legislation. As Pennsylvania gears up for the elections, the combination of this proposed bill and the charged political environment raises serious questions about access to the ballot and the overall democratic process.

As discussions about House Bill 29 progress, the implications for voter intimidation tactics loom large on the horizon. The outcome of this legislation could play a pivotal role in influencing voter behavior, particularly among those who may be discouraged by the prospect of facing challenges at the polls.

The focus now turns to Governor Shapiro, who will ultimately decide the fate of House Bill 29. As the state prepares for what many believe could be a contentious election season, the eyes of the nation are closely watching Pennsylvania, aware that the initiatives taken here may set the stage for political strategies in the future. The ongoing discourse surrounding voter intimidation, minority rights, and election integrity continues to generate fierce debate and concern among citizens and lawmakers alike.",-19.0,-21.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,605.0,-1.05,-0.03471074380165289

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first American Olympian to compete in the Olympics wearing a hijab, shared her reflections on her experiences as a Muslim woman in the United States. While Muhammad has faced personal challenges, including an unsettling incident where someone followed her home in an attempt to report her to the police, she emphasized that her feelings of insecurity are relatively minor compared to more serious issues, such as shootings and the political rhetoric that often targets Muslims.

During her discussions, Muhammad drew attention to the complexities of her situation, acknowledging that her experiences, though difficult, pale in comparison to the broader challenges faced by many in society. Her perspective sheds light on a narrative often overlooked, suggesting that America is not as deeply ""Islamophobic"" as it is commonly perceived. One striking point highlighted in her conversation is that hate crimes against Jewish individuals far exceed those against Muslims, indicating that the landscape of intolerance is more nuanced than typically portrayed.

Amid her reflections on insecurity, the narrative raises a provocative question: if Muhammad finds life in America so intolerable, why not consider relocating to a Muslim-majority country? This inquiry opens a dialogue about the conditions Muslims face both in America and abroad, with arguments suggesting that, in many respects, Muslims enjoy better opportunities and protections within the U.S. compared to potential dangers that could arise in various Muslim countries.

The article further posits that Muhammad encounters significantly fewer life-threatening issues in America when juxtaposed with the challenges prevalent in several regions with predominantly Muslim populations. These assertions shape a complex discussion surrounding identity, belonging, and the contrasting realities faced by Muslims in different parts of the world.

As Muhammad continues to break barriers in sports and inspire many, her experiences and insights prompt an important conversation about understanding and addressing the multifaceted nature of discrimination and acceptance in contemporary society.",-23.0,5.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,360.0,0.5,0.013888888888888888
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

Charlotte, NC – Protests in Charlotte recently escalated into chaos, resulting in violence and looting in the aftermath of a shooting incident involving a black police officer and a black suspect. Despite calls for justice and understanding, the demonstrations turned destructive, leading to widespread criticism of the protestors' actions.

The shooting, which occurred under contentious circumstances, was intended to spark dialogue and peaceful protest. However, what unfolded was a scene of mayhem, as rioters utilized the opportunity to loot nearby businesses and engage in disorderly conduct. Eyewitness accounts reveal that the chaos did not adhere to any straightforward racial narrative, raising questions about the motivations behind the vandalism and looting.

As tensions heighten in the wake of the shooting, the treatment of law enforcement officers by protestors has come under severe scrutiny. In a disturbing incident captured on video, an injured officer was reportedly laughed at by members of the crowd as he awaited backup. This act sparked outrage both locally and nationally, as many condemned the protestors for their lack of empathy towards those tasked with maintaining public safety, even amidst ongoing discussions about police accountability.

Critics of the protestors have not held back in their accusations. They assert that many involved in the demonstrations do not genuinely prioritize black lives or the fight against systemic injustice, evidenced by the violence that erupted among the crowd itself. Instances of altercations between protestors were noted, complicating the narrative that the protests were solely about seeking justice and equality.

Moreover, these events have coincided with a broader negative portrayal of supporters of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Detractors have described them as uneducated and violent, perpetuating a narrative that frames the movement as being associated with theft and vandalism rather than with its founding principles of social justice and equality. The rhetoric surrounding the movement has become increasingly charged, with critics offering a blanket condemnation designed to undermine its ethos.

The situation has provoked a public conversation about the legitimacy and effectiveness of protests in Charlotte and beyond. Accusations are being thrown around that the unrest is more reflective of a rebellion against the systems in place rather than a meaningful expression of solidarity with the black community. This disconnect has left many wondering if the protests are serving their intended purpose of promoting understanding and systemic change.

Supporters of the BLM movement argue that criticisms are being misdirected, emphasizing that their cause is rooted in advocating for equity and justice for all marginalized communities. They maintain that the actions of a few during these turbulent events should not overshadow the fundamental principles the movement stands for. However, the violence and looting have served to complicate this message and have led to intensified scrutiny from the media and the public.

As Charlotte continues to grapple with the ramifications of this incident, a growing number of individuals are calling for a reevaluation of protest strategies. Many believe that peaceful demonstrations can offer a more potent means of engaging with local communities and changing hearts and minds about the issues at hand. The hope is that productive engagement can stem from the discussions that these protests generate, rather than devolving into violence and chaos.

The tensions underlying these protests and the responses to them reflect a fractured relationship between segments of the community and law enforcement, raising important questions about race, justice, and public safety in America today. The coming days will be critical in determining how both sides can move forward, heal, and address the deep-seated issues that continue to divide communities in Charlotte and elsewhere.

As the dust settles on this turbulent chapter, stakeholders from all walks of life must reconsider their approaches to activism, dialogue, and change. It remains vital to focus on genuine concerns for human life and dignity, rather than allowing actions—whether by protestors or law enforcement—to dictate the broader narrative. Without a resolution to these tensions, the cycle of violence and misunderstanding is likely to persist, overshadowing the very real issues that demand attention and empathy from all.",-83.0,-53.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,748.0,-1.8928571428571428,-0.07085561497326204
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In his final address as a sitting President at the United Nations General Assembly, Barack Obama has stirred considerable debate with remarks that highlight his far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal ideology. The outgoing President, already under scrutiny for various policies, including the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and increased acceptance of refugees, used this pivotal moment to espouse his vision for a ""one world order"" style of international governance.

During his speech, Obama made the provocative claim that the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms in the interest of global security. This suggestion has raised eyebrows among many critics who argue that it undermines the foundational principles of individual liberty and constitutional rights that Americans hold dear. Obama's emphasis on the necessity of international institutions, particularly the United Nations, to achieve global security reflects a commitment to a collectivist approach that some believe prioritizes international concerns over national sovereignty.

While acknowledging the criticism from Americans regarding his views, Obama remained resolute, asserting that the right to defend oneself is the singular freedom that should be preserved in the face of potential sacrifices. His unapologetic stance has drawn ire and frustration from those who view it as indicative of an arrogant attitude and an unwillingness to listen to opposing perspectives.

Critics have likened Obama's approach to parents who impose strict rules on their children but fail to adhere to the same standards themselves. This analogy captures the frustration felt by many who believe that his globalist vision does not resonate with the values and needs of his constituents at home.

As Obama steps down from the presidency, the implications of his final speech echo a call for a reimagined relationship between individual freedoms and collective security, leaving many to ponder the true cost of such a vision in today's political climate.",13.0,10.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,346.0,1.0,0.028901734104046242
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the ever-evolving landscape of the NFL, both Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick stand currently on the sidelines, neither serving as a starting quarterback. However, their public personas and approaches to their positions could not be more contrasting. Tebow is portrayed as a figure of class and respect, while Kaepernick garners criticism for his actions and public stance.

Tim Tebow, an athlete known for his strong convictions and sportsmanship, has made limited comments regarding Kaepernick's controversial protest of the National Anthem. By refraining from diving deeply into the discourse, Tebow suggests a belief in standing firm for one’s convictions in a manner that is respectful and dignified. This approach resonates with those who value traditional expressions of patriotism.

On the other hand, Kaepernick, who remains a high-paid bench player, faces scrutiny for the way he has chosen to express his views. The article posits that Kaepernick’s protests are not only disrespectful to the longstanding tradition of honoring the National Anthem but also implies a need for him to articulate his beliefs outside the realm of professional sports. The author argues that athletes, particularly those in prominent positions, hold a responsibility to use their platforms thoughtfully.

Central to the article's critique is the notion of oppression in America. The author contends that the claims of oppression relayed by Kaepernick and others reflect a mindset characterized by laziness and a lack of initiative. The piece references the achievements of notable figures such as President Obama as counterpoints, emphasizing that success is attainable without succumbing to a victim mentality. The sentiment articulated is clear: those who feel marginalized in society can improve their circumstances through hard work and dedication, potentially by filling out job applications and seeking opportunities.

Furthermore, the discussion extends to the concept of Affirmative Action, which is critiqued as a source of oppression for others rather than a remedy. The author argues that the implementation of such policies can create further division and resentment rather than fostering equality, thereby complicating the lives of those who might not benefit from these measures.

In a positive light, Tim Tebow is commended for his ability to navigate the sports world without negative press, and best wishes are extended towards his endeavors with the New York Mets. His reputation for maintaining integrity on and off the field stands in stark contrast to the controversies surrounding Kaepernick.

In conclusion, the article presents a strong negative sentiment towards Kaepernick, characterizing his methods as ineffective and disrespectful while honoring Tebow’s commitment to dignity and respect. This comparison serves to highlight divergent values that resonate throughout the ongoing discussions within the NFL and society at large.",-6.0,14.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,503.0,0.7368421052631579,0.027833001988071572
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

In the ongoing debate over national security, the construction of a robust border wall has emerged as a critical solution in controlling illegal immigration and addressing broader national security measures. Historical precedents underscore the importance of building fortifications; take, for instance, China’s Great Wall, which was originally erected not only to keep out immigrants but primarily to ward off foreign invaders.

Today, the situation in Mexico presents considerable challenges. Drug cartels have significantly increased their control over vast areas of the country, creating an environment where criminal activity thrives and security threats proliferate. The implications of this instability are far-reaching, with fears mounting that groups such as ISIS could exploit weaknesses at the Southern Border to infiltrate the United States.

Compounding these fears, a recent report highlighted a major security incident wherein eight Syrian nationals attempted to enter the U.S. illegally from Mexico. This attempted breach raised alarms in light of past terrorist activities, including the harrowing events following the Paris attacks. The Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, with federal agents confirming the apprehension of these individuals.

Hector Garza, president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, acknowledged that agents in the field have communicated about these unauthorized crossings. However, Garza refrained from corroborating specific details for security reasons, indicating the sensitivity and complexity of border enforcement operations. 

Adding to the intricacy of the situation, Border Patrol agents continually face challenges in maintaining border security due to limited resources. Reports have surfaced suggesting that many individuals caught entering the U.S. illegally are allowed to remain, raising concerns about the effectiveness of current border control measures.

Given these challenges, there is an urgent need for a more secure border, with calls resonating for a presidential candidate who is committed to addressing these critical security issues. The push for a solidified approach to border defense is not just about controlling immigration but preserving national sovereignty in the face of evolving threats from drug cartels and potential terrorist infiltration.

As the debate over immigration policy intensifies, it’s clear that the stakes are high. The history lessons taught by structures like the Great Wall serve as a reminder of the complexities involved in securing a nation, emphasizing that while the walls may be physical, the challenge they embody is one that shapes the very fabric of national security today.",-13.0,-8.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,446.0,-0.5,-0.017937219730941704

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

In a recent community forum, members of the Haitian audience passionately shared their experiences regarding political figures, particularly Donald Trump. The gathering transformed into a platform for strong admiration for Trump, with attendees cheering and sharing personal stories highlighting their positive views of the former president.

In stark contrast, the audience directed harsh criticism at the Clintons, expressing disappointment over their perceived lack of support and presence despite having received significant donations intended for Haiti. Attendees presented what they considered evidence of the Clintons' mishandling of aid meant for the recovery of the Caribbean nation. Accusations were made that a considerable portion of the financial aid designated for Haiti did not reach those in need. Instead, it was alleged that the funds disproportionately benefitted Washington lobbyists and the White House.

Hillary Clinton faced particularly intense scrutiny, with community members condemning her opposition to a proposed increase in Haiti's minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. The sentiment among the audience indicated a sustained frustration with the Clintons’ actions regarding Haiti.

Interestingly, the media's presence at the event was noticeably brief, as reports emerged that journalists left early. Observers noted that the departure seemed driven by a desire to avoid reporting on the audience's overwhelmingly positive sentiments toward Trump and their critical views of Hillary Clinton, which did not align with prevailing narratives. The forum thus illuminated a complex intersection of local perceptions and broader political dynamics.",-2.0,5.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,281.0,0.45454545454545453,0.017793594306049824
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

A recent surge in public opinion indicates that more Australians may support a ban on Muslim immigration, reflecting heightened concerns about terrorism and cultural integration. This growing sentiment follows Donald Trump's controversial proposal to impose a ban on Muslim immigrants in the United States, which he argued was necessary to address rising terrorism threats.

Critics, particularly from the Democratic party, have labeled Trump's proposal as racist, arguing that racism pertains strictly to race. However, the discussion around Trump's ban raises questions about whether it is racist or a valid response to public safety issues. The assertion is that Islam, as a religion, is susceptible to radicalization, thereby justifying concerns over some Muslims entering the country.

Recent data from Essential Research reveals a significant shift in Australian public opinion, with 49% supporting a ban on Muslim immigration – an increase from just 28% last October. The survey highlights an underlying unease, with fears about terrorism and beliefs that Muslim migrants do not integrate or align with Australian values being the primary reasons driving this surge.

Furthermore, the poll indicates that nearly half (48%) of voters are in favor of a national debate on the issue. This willingness to engage in dialogue underscores the importance many Australians place on thoroughly discussing the implications of immigration policies.

The political landscape surrounding this issue reveals a broad coalition of support. Findings show that 60% of Coalition voters favor a ban on Muslim immigration, alongside 40% of Labour voters and 34% of Green voters. This cross-party support suggests that the sentiments are not confined to fringe groups but resonate widely across the populace, challenging the notion that advocates of such a ban form just a “marginalized rump.”

Senator Pauline Hanson, known for her outspoken views on immigration, appears to have tapped into this vein of public sentiment. Two-thirds of Australians agree that she addresses topics that other politicians tend to avoid, suggesting a yearning for candid discourse about immigration and its complexities. Her rise in political prominence mirrors the growing apprehension among the Australian public regarding the consequences of unchecked immigration.

The implications of this shift in public opinion may be more profound than anticipated. As Australia wrestles with the global ramifications of terrorism, the fear of violent extremism increasingly shapes immigration discourse. This is particularly true for those invoking a sense of national identity that aligns with shared values, which some believe are being undermined by certain immigrant communities.

Amid this backdrop, politically motivated opposition to such views continues to emerge. Notably, former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approach in countering Trump's immigration stance has faced criticism. Observers argue that her response should have included a recognition of differing opinions rather than outright dismissal. This perspective emphasizes the necessity for constructive dialogue that acknowledges public fears while striving for inclusive solutions.

As Australia navigates the complexities of immigration, the growing support for a ban on Muslim immigration signals a critical moment of reflection for policymakers. The intersections of national security, cultural identity, and public sentiment have created a challenging landscape for governance.

In conclusion, the rapidly changing attitudes toward Muslim immigration in Australia reveal significant public anxiety about safety and cultural integration. As opinions shift, the importance of discussing these issues in a respectful and thoughtful manner cannot be overstated. This national conversation will likely shape future policies and political discourse surrounding immigration in Australia for years to come.",2.0,1.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,647.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0015455950540958269

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a recent piece by Buzzfeed, questions were raised regarding the accuracy of a previous description detailing a crime and its victims. The initial article sparked significant outrage, but a follow-up investigation has debunked the claims, clarifying the sequence of events that transpired during a disturbing incident.

The chaotic scene unfolded with individuals seemingly preparing for a confrontation in the street. However, the situation escalated rapidly and took a horrifying turn when several people were inexplicably set on fire. This unsettling act has inevitably prompted further examination of the mindset and possible premeditation of the assailant. The decision to inflict such violence raises serious concerns about the motives behind the attack, as well as the troubling nature of humanity when such actions are involved.

Amidst this tragedy, reflections have surfaced regarding the decline of societal values over the years. The author of the follow-up article poignantly contrasts the past with the present, lamenting a time when people instinctively intervened to prevent harm. In stark contrast, today’s bystanders often choose to document such incidents through social media rather than stepping in to help. This shift in human behavior underscores a growing indifference that has permeated modern society, leading to increasing violence and apathy.

Critically examining the reality we live in, the article serves as a poignant reminder of the necessity for individuals to cultivate a sense of compassion and responsibility toward one another. It raises the fundamental question of why many now prioritize their devices over their moral obligation to intervene during times of crisis. This indisposition to act results in a culture where those suffering may feel isolated and abandoned amidst violence.

As society grapples with the implications of such incidents, the importance of fostering empathy and connection emerges as essential. The narrative encourages readers to prioritize caring for others and taking action in moments of danger, rather than becoming passive witnesses to brutality. The need for meaningful dialogue about communal responsibility and psychological preparedness in the face of violence has never been more vital.

In summary, the debunked claims surrounding this harrowing incident reveal not only the complexities of crime but also invite critical reflections on the state of human compassion in today's world.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- There is a call for constructing a border wall to enhance national security, beyond just preventing illegal immigration.

Amid growing concerns over national security, there is an escalating call for the construction of a border wall to enhance safety across the United States, prompting debates that extend beyond preventing illegal immigration. This renewed urgency follows a troubling incident in Luna County, New Mexico, where a routine traffic stop led to the arrest of an undocumented Middle Eastern woman, identified as an “Islamic refugee,” who was discovered carrying plans for a local gas pipeline.

Authorities remain puzzled regarding the intentions behind the woman's possession of the pipeline plans, sparking fears of potential future terror attacks in the region. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, along with U.S. Border Patrol, promptly investigated the area following the arrest but reported no immediate threats. However, the incident has raised alarms, particularly concerning the pipeline located in Deming, New Mexico, a remote area that could pose vulnerabilities to national security.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, a 2015 report by Judicial Watch noted unsettling collaborations between Mexican cartels and terror organizations that facilitate the smuggling of individuals from terror-affected countries into the U.S. Furthermore, a subsequent 2017 Judicial Watch report indicated that Islamic terror groups have been identified as crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to scout potential attack targets, increasing the stakes in an already precarious landscape.

As discussions surrounding border security gain momentum, there is an urgent call for Congress to allocate funding for President Trump's proposed border wall. Supporters argue that the wall is a crucial measure against threats posed not only by terrorists but also by drug cartels that exploit existing vulnerabilities. Alarmingly, many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not from Mexico but hail from countries further south, often receiving support in transit from the Mexican government, complicating the issue further.

The perception that terrorists can easily infiltrate the United States via the southern border without adequate vetting has fueled these concerns. Advocates for the border wall assert that it is an essential step to fortify national security against foreign threats that have the potential to disrupt peace and stability within the country.

In conclusion, the incident in Luna County underscores a pressing need for enhanced border security measures. As discussions continue, the consensus remains clear: constructing a wall is deemed vital to safeguarding the nation from a range of foreign threats, ensuring a more secure environment for all Americans.",-44.0,-35.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,452.0,-2.5,-0.07743362831858407
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In the world of professional sports, where athletic prowess often takes center stage, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is using his platform to speak about values that extend far beyond the football field. Wilson recently shared insights into his core life purposes, which revolve around his love for God and a commitment to helping others.

For Wilson, the foundation of a fulfilling life lies in the belief that true joy comes from faith and making positive choices. ""I strive to inspire others toward true joy,"" Wilson stated, underscoring the importance of living a life that reflects faith-based values. This drive to spread positivity is not merely a personal ambition; rather, Wilson views it as a responsibility to influence those around him.

Prioritization is key for Wilson, who clarifies that his life's hierarchy places God first, family and friends second, and football third. ""Each of these elements is essential,"" he said, ""but faith is what anchors me."" This perspective speaks volumes about his character, particularly in a profession where many athletes succumb to the pressures and distractions of fame.

Despite restrictions within the National Football League (NFL) that limit players' expressions of faith, Wilson remains steadfast in his belief that actions can speak louder than words. He expressed confidence that through his conduct on and off the field, he can convey a message of hope and perseverance. ""It's not just about what I say; it's about what I do,"" he emphasized.

In a time when public discourse often seems polarized, Wilson critiqued the one-sidedness of discussions surrounding freedom of expression, particularly in the context of faith. He highlighted the importance of respecting diverse beliefs while also advocating for a conversation that includes perspectives on morality and ethics. ""It’s essential that we keep the dialogue open and recognize the value of different views,"" he noted.

The quarterback's advocacy for a strong moral compass is particularly relevant in today's society, which he believes often succumbs to corruption and dishonor. Wilson encourages individuals to stand firm in their values, serving as beacons of light in a world that can seem overwhelming at times. ""We need to remind ourselves of the importance of integrity and honesty,"" he urged, stressing that personal ethics remain paramount.

One of Wilson's primary messages is the importance of serving others. In his view, uplifting those in need is crucial for creating a more positive environment. ""We live in a society where kindness and compassion can often be forgotten,"" he lamented, advocating for everyone to make an effort to spread goodwill.

As he reflects on the current climate of societal values, Wilson expressed concern that the scales are tipping towards dishonor, pulling people away from what he considers to be goodness. ""We must address this shift,"" he warned, adding that it is essential for individuals to engage in thoughtful conversations about the values that guide their lives. 

In Wilson's eyes, true fulfillment is deeply intertwined with faith and community service. By prioritizing God and choosing to help others, he hopes to cultivate a culture that embraces positivity and real joy. As he continues to lead both on and off the field, his commitment to these values stands as a testament that life’s true purpose lies not merely in success, but in the legacy of hope and inspiration that one leaves behind.",79.0,91.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,656.0,3.64,0.13871951219512196
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

Pope Francis has issued a pointed critique of fear-based media, likening its impact on society to the effects of terrorism. His comments, aimed primarily at Italy’s press, carry a universal message intended to resonate with audiences around the world, particularly in the United States. The Pope emphasized that a journalism rooted in gossip or rumors not only harms individuals but also damages communities, calling for a more responsible and compassionate approach to news reporting.

In his remarks, Pope Francis evoked the famous words of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, underscoring the idea that fear itself can serve as a formidable enemy. This perspective is particularly relevant in today's media landscape, where sensationalism has often overshadowed facts. While the Pope’s comments were made in the context of Italian media, they reflect a growing concern over how media narratives can shape public perception and contribute to societal anxiety.

Despite a notable decline in crime rates and extremely low probabilities of terrorism-related fatalities in the U.S., there has been a marked increase in fear among the American populace. This rise in anxiety is largely influenced by the narratives propagated by various media outlets, with Fox News noted for its particularly powerful role in shaping fears surrounding crime and terrorism. 

Recent polls have illustrated a troubling trend, revealing that Americans are now more concerned about crime and terrorism than at any point in over a decade, even as overall crime statistics continue to decline. This paradox highlights the efficacy of fear-based narratives in manipulating public sentiment, a theme that resonates with Pope Francis's observations about the dangers of sensational journalism.

The Pope's comments arrive against a backdrop of heightened political tensions, especially during the years of Donald Trump's presidency, when the media landscape was marked by divisive rhetoric and alarmist coverage. Such an environment has contributed to an atmosphere of fear and unease among citizens, prompting many to question the motives and responsibilities of media institutions.

In the face of these challenges, Pope Francis calls for a reevaluation of journalistic practices. He urges media professionals to prioritize accuracy and social responsibility over sensational stories that would serve only to inflame fear and division. His hope is that a return to ethical reporting can help to foster a more informed and cohesive society, allowing communities to thrive free from the grip of irrational fear.

This critique serves as a poignant reminder of the powerful influence media can exert on public consciousness and the urgent need for a responsible approach to reporting in today's fractured media landscape.",-56.0,-28.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,478.0,-1.75,-0.058577405857740586
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and

CNN's internal polling declared Hillary Clinton the winner, reporting that 62% of those surveyed favored her performance, while only 27% considered Donald Trump the victor. However, various snap polls from outlets such as TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville presented contrasting results, suggesting Trump had gained the upper hand.

Key discussion topics during the debate included the controversial Birther movement, Clinton's email scandal, and Trump’s tax returns. The candidates were poised to tackle these contentious issues, each attempting to sway undecided voters in the lead-up to the election.

Trump took to Twitter following the debate, thanking his supporters for what he perceived as favorable polling outcomes. In contrast, Clinton has not yet publicly commented on her polling results. CNN's results have drawn scrutiny, with critics questioning the integrity of the poll due to a sample that leaned towards Democratic respondents. Despite Clinton's substantial lead in CNN's survey, analysts noted mixed results regarding how these outcomes would influence the voters' final decisions.

Adding to the drama, Trump openly criticized the media during his post-debate remarks, alleging that the microphone he was provided was defective and claiming it hampered his performance. He also suggested he should have brought up former President Bill Clinton's infidelity as a counterpoint during the debate.

As the election looms closer, both candidates face an urgent deadline to secure undecided voters. The stakes are high, and the mixed polling results indicate a contentious race that remains too close to call. Additionally, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has hinted at an impending ""October surprise"" that could potentially impact Clinton's campaign. With reasons for concern mounting on both sides, the spotlight remains firmly on how the candidates will navigate the tumultuous landscape as election day approaches.",18.0,-6.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,381.0,-0.4,-0.015748031496062992
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

CNN's focus group, made up of Florida voters, reported a striking 18-2 victory for Clinton. Conversely, a separate focus group conducted by Fox News, led by pollster Frank Luntz, yielded a score of 16-6 in favor of Clinton as well, demonstrating a consensus among watchers from different political backgrounds regarding her performance.

Luntz, known for his insightful analysis, highlighted Trump's struggles, particularly on the topic of taxes, which seemed to hinder his overall effectiveness. However, Trump demonstrated a stronger performance when discussing Clinton's email scandal, showing a capacity to engage voters on subjects with which they might resonate. Yet, Luntz noted a severe drop in Trump’s performance when he addressed the controversial topic of President Obama’s birthplace, an issue that appears to have alienated some potential supporters.

Amidst these findings, a poll from the Drudge Report suggested a starkly contrasting opinion; it indicated that Trump received overwhelming support, receiving 92% of the poll’s votes, compared to Clinton's mere 8%. This discrepancy underscores the polarized nature of the current political landscape.

In the wake of Clinton's tweet claiming victory in the debate, social media lit up with discussions, particularly highlighted by the trending hashtag #TrumpWon, which reflected significant backlash against her assertion. This indicates that while focus group results may favor Clinton, public sentiment online remains fiercely divided.

Critics have also voiced concerns regarding Clinton's media presence following the debate, suggesting that her avoidance may impact perceptions of her candidacy moving forward. With both campaigns gearing up for the next stage of the election, the implications of these debates and public reactions will likely play a critical role in shaping voter opinions as the race intensifies.",18.0,10.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,362.0,0.8333333333333334,0.027624309392265192
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC - Protests intensified in the city of Charlotte for the second consecutive night following the police killing of 29-year-old Kenneth L. Scott. What began as a peaceful demonstration rapidly escalated into chaos, raising serious questions about police conduct and accountability amidst growing community outrage.

Witnesses at the scene described a somber gathering where hundreds marched, united in their demand for justice, chanting slogans such as “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot.” The protest was fueled by anger over Scott's death—a shooting that many in the community have deemed excessive and unjust. Participants expressed their grief and anger over systemic issues related to police violence against African-American individuals, creating a backdrop of heightened emotional tension.

However, the atmosphere shifted dramatically when riot police arrived on the scene. Eyewitness accounts suggest that the presence of law enforcement stirred unease in the crowd, which had initially assembled peacefully to honor Scott’s memory and protest police brutality. Reports of loud gunfire erupted in the air, leaving many attendees startled and confused.

Tragically, amidst the unfolding chaos, a civilian was critically injured after a gunshot wound to the head. As news of the injury spread, conflicting narratives emerged regarding the identity of the shooter. While police claimed that the gunfire resulted from another civilian, testimony from various eyewitnesses contradicted that claim. 

Eyewitness Todd Zimmer took to Twitter expressing deep concern, alleging that the city was not revealing the complete truth about the incident. “How can the city lie about this?” Zimmer posted. “I was there, and it was clearly not another civilian who fired the shots.” His sentiments echoed throughout the community, further fueling suspicions regarding police transparency.

Adding to the disquiet, prominent North Carolina criminal defense lawyer Kahran Meyer, who also witnessed the events unfold, corroborated Zimmer’s assertions. Meyer stated unequivocally, “It was not a civilian who shot that protester; something is extremely wrong here.” Such testimonies cast a long shadow over official accounts of the incident, creating a rift of distrust between community members and law enforcement.

The situation continued to deteriorate as tensions escalated when police deployed tear gas into the crowd of retreating protesters. Eyewitness reports highlighted the desperation of those who sought to escape the toxic fumes, and many were left gasping for air in the wake of the chemical dispersant. The decision to use tear gas has drawn criticism, labeling it an excessive response to a largely peaceful assembly.

As the dust settled from the night of turmoil, the City of Charlotte quickly issued a statement attempting to clarify the situation surrounding the injury. The official narrative maintained that the civilian injury was a result of civilian involvement rather than police action. However, this assertion did little to quell the rising discontent among protesters.

Multiple eyewitness testimonies from clergy members and other attendees emerged, lending credence to claims that the injured protester was shot by police. As these voices spoke out, calls for accountability grew louder, echoing the sentiment that has resonated through African-American communities across the nation: the toll of police violence is intolerable.

The events in Charlotte reflect a broader narrative concerning the mounting frustrations felt within African-American communities regarding police encounters. The protests, rooted in the tragic death of Kenneth L. Scott, symbolize an ongoing struggle that extends beyond individual incidents. They speak to broader systemic issues that many feel are perpetuated by a lack of transparency and accountability in law enforcement.

As mourners continue to grieve, the City of Charlotte is faced with scrutiny and pressure to address these matters head-on. The grassroots nature of these protests and the widespread public outcry places the city in a challenging position: to go beyond merely offering statements and instead engage in meaningful dialogues with the affected communities.

The community’s demand for justice and reform holds significant weight, with many calling for an independent investigation into the events of the past two nights. Activists have urged local officials to look beyond the superficial aspects of policing and address the root causes of discontent that lead to such fierce protests.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of the protests, the presence of continued tensions looms heavy over the city. The path forward requires not only acknowledgment of the pain suffered by families like that of Kenneth L. Scott but also a concerted effort to bridge the divides between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

In light of these developments, it remains essential for all parties involved to respect the voices of those exercising their rights to peacefully protest. The hope for resolution lies in transformative pathways that foster understanding, ultimately leading toward a future where the lives of all citizens, regardless of race, are valued and protected. Charlotte now stands at a crossroads, as the city must reckon with the lessons of its past while moving toward a promise of justice and equity for all its residents. 

As the narrative surrounding police accountability continues to unfold in Charlotte, one thing remains clear: the people’s voices will not be silenced until justice is achieved. The memory of Kenneth L. Scott serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of safeguarding lives while pressing for change in a system that must evolve to better serve—and protect—all its citizens.",-74.0,-66.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,983.0,-1.7837837837837838,-0.0671414038657172
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the election approaches, Republican nominee Donald Trump has come under intense scrutiny regarding his foreign policy stance, particularly in relation to Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Critics argue that Trump's past connections and ongoing relationships with individuals linked to the Kremlin may undermine American interests and compromise national security.

Trump has often touted his foreign policy perspective, but his record suggests a troubling inclination towards support for Russia. Evidence shows he is surrounded by a network of advisors and supporters who share connections with Russian leadership. Additionally, Trump has received favorable coverage from Russian state-controlled media and is reportedly receiving support from elements within Russian intelligence, raising alarms among wary observers.

Despite his claims to the contrary, Trump's relationship with Russia is more complicated than he has led the public to believe. He once asserted that he has ""ZERO investments"" in Russia, painting a picture of detachment from the country. However, a recent investigation by ABC News contradicts this assertion, revealing that Trump has ""numerous ties"" to Russian financial interests. This investigation has uncovered business dealings that could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, further complicating Trump's narrative.

Among the significant financial ventures identified were Trump's hosting of the Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 and various real estate transactions involving Russian buyers. These dealings expose a plausible pathway for Russian oligarchs, who have profited enormously from Russia's shift to a free-market economy, to utilize Trump’s properties as conduits for moving wealth out of Russia. This benefit raises significant questions about the intersection of Trump's business and foreign policy motives.

Critics have highlighted the self-interested motivations of these oligarchs, many of whom maintain strong allegiances to Putin. A former KGB agent has described them as ""self-interested materialists,"" suggesting that their priorities may not align with American values or interests. The precariousness of Trump's connections to these individuals raises profound concerns about his governance.

Further complicating the situation, sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs by the U.S. government in 2014 aim to restrict their financial dealings and operations. Despite this, in the context of his campaign, Trump has signaled that he may reevaluate these sanctions should he win the presidency. This potential action raises alarms about the implications of his financial entanglements. Could Trump prioritize personal financial gain over national security? This unanswered question looms large as a disturbing possibility in the current political landscape.

Concerns over Trump’s financial entanglements point to a broader issue: the likely conflict of interest between his personal business dealings and U.S. foreign policy. Observers fear that a Trump presidency could pave the way for increased corruption, enabling Russian interests to unduly influence American policy and decisions. Such a scenario would not only put the integrity of U.S. foreign policy at risk but could also erode public trust in democratic institutions.

As the election cycle intensifies, the debate surrounding Trump's ties to Russia and his potential presidency grows increasingly urgent. Critics are imploring Congress to take proactive measures to address these concerns. There are growing calls for accountability and transparency, with some suggesting that Congress should take definitive steps to mitigate any undue influence arising from Trump’s overwhelming private interests in Russia.

In light of the complexities surrounding Trump’s associations with individuals connected to the Kremlin and the broader implications for American national security, the call for action is clear. Lawmakers are urged to assess not just Trump's financial interests, but their potential to compromise U.S. interests on the global stage. The intersection of business and politics is under unprecedented scrutiny, and as the election approaches, the visibility of this issue will likely increase.

The landscape of American politics is fraught with challenges, and the responsibility of leaders remains critical. With significant concerns about corruption and foreign influence at stake, the imperative for Congress to act cannot be overstated. Ensuring the integrity of U.S. foreign policy—to safeguard democracy and uphold national security—will demand vigilance and action from all branches of government as the potential consequences of inaction loom on the horizon.

Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is under intensified scrutiny as he faces the possibility of impeachment connected to the controversial ""Bridgegate"" scandal. The ongoing legal proceedings against three of Christie's senior aides, who are accused of conspiring to close access lanes to the George Washington Bridge as a means to punish a political rival, have thrown the governor's own political future into uncertainty.

The potential for impeachment looms large as investigations continue to unfold. Should evidence indicate that Christie orchestrated the bridge closures, articles of impeachment could be filed against him. This stark prospect hangs over the governor as federal prosecutors allege that he was deeply involved in the plan that not only caused severe traffic issues but also resulted in a tragic death.

In a significant development related to the scandal, a judge has mandated that Christie produce personal emails pertaining to the case. These documents could be critical in understanding the extent of Christie's knowledge and involvement in the chaotic incident that drew public outrage and led to multiple investigations. The decision to formally pursue impeachment ultimately lies with Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto, who must weigh the implications of moving forward with a process that could alter the state's political landscape.

To successfully impeach Christie, a majority vote from the 80-member New Jersey Assembly would be required. If that threshold is met, the governor would still need to navigate a daunting two-thirds majority in the state Senate to avoid conviction and removal from office. The stakes could not be higher, as Christie's leadership and legacy hang in the balance with each passing day.

Christie currently serves as the chairperson for Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump's transition team, a position that has been met with mixed reactions. While it may offer him a platform to remain influential in Republican politics, many perceive his endorsement of Trump as a significant decline in his once-promising political status. As a figure once viewed as a rising star in the GOP, Christie's trajectory has sharply shifted in light of the ongoing scandal.

In past statements, Christie has consistently denied any prior knowledge of the plot against his political opponent. However, contrary evidence has emerged, complicating his defense. Notably, it has come to light that the governor was informed during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 that the bridge closures were occurring. His subsequent lack of action on the matter has raised questions regarding his accountability and commitment to public service.

The potential impeachment of Chris Christie marks a significant fall from grace for a governor who once commanded considerable respect within the Republican Party. His leadership style and decisive moments in office had previously garnered national attention, leading to expectations of a continued upward trajectory. However, the ongoing scandal, along with the evolving legal disputes surrounding his administration, threatens to overshadow his earlier successes.

As New Jersey residents and political analysts closely watch these developments, the implications of this scandal stretch beyond Christie himself. Should impeachment articles be filed and gain momentum, the fallout could reverberate through the state's political circles, altering alliances and affecting public trust in elected officials. The coming weeks will likely bring critical revelations that could determine the fate of one of New Jersey’s most prominent political figures.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a striking moment during the Republican primary debate held in September 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump asserted that he had never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling. This claim raised eyebrows and ignited debate among political pundits and the public alike. Trump's emphatic assertion implies an air of certainty about his influence in the political arena, hinting that he could have easily secured casino gambling had he truly wished to do so without the need for lobbying.

However, this proclamation leads to troubling questions regarding the authenticity of Trump’s claims, particularly given his prior statements. In a deposition taken in 2007, Trump openly admitted to advocating for casino gambling in Florida. The dissonance between his statements in the debate and the earlier admission introduces the perplexing issue of potential perjury. Trump’s dual narrative leaves many pondering the veracity of his claims and the implications for his character and integrity.

The conflicting accounts surrounding Trump's actions produce a scenario rife with intrigue. Some analysts suggest that Trump may have consciously misrepresented the facts during the debate to evade embarrassment over his apparent failure to influence Bush. This line of reasoning points to a possible lie crafted in the heat of the moment, aimed at fortifying his stance in front of an audience of Republican voters. Conversely, others argue that the earlier deposition poses a direct challenge to the truthfulness of his claim during the debate, raising serious concerns about the possibility of perjury.

Adding another layer to this contentious discourse, Governor Jeb Bush himself pushed back against Trump’s denial during the debate. Bush insisted that Trump had made efforts to persuade him regarding casino gambling, presenting a direct contradiction to Trump's remarks. The fiery exchange illustrated not only a clash of personalities but also a fundamental disagreement on the facts at hand. With contradicting narratives from two political figures, the debate underscored the broader implications of honesty, integrity, and accountability in politics.

The ramifications of Trump's inaccuracies extend beyond individual debates and touch upon larger questions of character. The recurrent theme of dishonesty in Trump's public persona raises alarm bells regarding the potential implications for national safety and governance. Such fabrications, whether intentional or not, pose a danger to the democratic process and the trust that the electorate places in its leaders. The article posits that, much like the charges faced by former President Bill Clinton, who was impeached for lying under oath, Trump's statements and actions could lead to significant political consequences.

The comparison between Trump’s situation and that of Clinton serves to illustrate the importance of accountability in the realm of public service. Clinton's impeachment was rooted in his inability to provide truthful testimony, and the gravity of that precedent resonates today. Political figures operate within a framework that requires honesty and integrity, and the public has a vested interest in holding their leaders accountable for failing to adhere to these standards.

As the debate transcript reveals, the confrontation between Trump and Bush encapsulates a broader narrative about truth in politics. Each candidate presented opposing views regarding Trump's involvement in the push for casino gambling, effectively highlighting the fracture in their respective narratives. This moment became emblematic of a political culture characterized by assertion without accountability, leaving audiences unsure which version of the truth to accept.

The article ultimately calls for action from the electorate regarding accountability for Trump’s alleged misconduct. The implications of his discrepancies are not merely fodder for political discourse but represent a significant question of integrity that demands consideration and response. Whether through impeachment or other forms of political accountability, the message is clear: the public must engage with the troubling patterns of deception that overshadow the political landscape.

In summary, the confrontation between Trump and Bush during that fateful September debate underscores the critical issues of truthfulness and accountability in politics. As political narratives clash and character flaws become evident, the electorate faces an imperative to demand integrity from those who seek public office. The actions and statement of leaders must be scrutinized, as the future of political trust and democracy hinges on the commitment to uphold honesty and ethics in the public sphere.",-29.0,-31.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,782.0,-1.0,-0.03964194373401535
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers tuned into the commercial-free debate on CNN and turned it into a drinking game.

As Americans gear up for the upcoming presidential debates, many viewers are already transforming the political discourse into a spirited event, taking part in drinking games that have gained popularity, particularly during the recent commercial-free debate aired on CNN. However, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy is sounding the alarm about the potential dangers associated with this trend.

In a candid warning, Murthy stated that drinking every time former President Donald Trump tells a lie could lead to serious health risks, including alcohol poisoning. His concerns stem from the historical context of drinking games during political events; there were approximately 70,000 alcohol-poison-related instances reported during the 2012 presidential debates, a staggering figure that underscores the need for caution.

Murthy previously raised alarms about drinking games during debates back in 2015, cautioning viewers about their potential dangers. Ahead of the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump on September 26, 2016, he reiterated the risks associated with excessive drinking, particularly when pointed remarks from Trump could lead to spinning the bottle more than one might expect.

A study conducted by Politico revealed the staggering frequency of Trump’s deceptions, noting that he told 87 lies within just a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, 2016. The analysis broke down to an average of a lie approximately every three minutes and 15 seconds during five hours of public remarks. Based on this average, Murthy speculated that viewers might hear around 28 lies during the CNN debate, which rapidly escalates the risk for drinking game participants.

With the memories of previous health crises involving alcohol misuse lingering, the Surgeon General emphasized that first responders are preparing for potential alcohol-related emergencies following the debates. He urged viewers to approach this leisure activity responsibly, suggesting the practice of ""baby sips"" in response to Trump’s fabrications. 

As the political landscape continues to heat up, Murthy reminds the public that while engaging in the electoral process can be enjoyable, moderation is key. The impending debates may fuel both excitement and an urge to indulge, but the message from health officials remains clear: drink responsibly, and stay safe.",-17.0,-3.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,406.0,-0.23076923076923078,-0.007389162561576354
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, mainstream media outlets have overwhelmingly declared Hillary Clinton the winner, praising her performance and articulating confidence in her candidacy. However, contrasting sentiments emerged from social media platforms, specifically Twitter, where the hashtag #TrumpWon surged to become the top trend in the United States post-debate. This divergence raises essential questions about the integrity of public perception and potential external influences.

The origins of the #TrumpWon hashtag are particularly noteworthy, tracing back to St. Petersburg, Russia. Reports have indicated that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin employs cyber-trolls who disseminate disinformation and foster discord on social media. These trolls are known to operate under conditions described by former bloggers as harsh and heavily monitored, underscoring a well-organized strategy to manipulate narratives in favor of certain political outcomes.

Putin’s ambitions reportedly extend beyond mere trolling; they aim to manipulate U.S. politics to influence the lifting of sanctions that were imposed following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. By stoking division and promoting specific hashtags, this elaborate scheme appears designed to sway public opinion and complicate the political landscape in the United States.

In light of these developments, experts are advising skepticism towards online polls and discussions that trend on social media, suggesting that the presence of Russian trolls may distorts genuine public sentiment. This highlights a broader concern regarding the validity of online engagement and the extent to which it can reflect the views of the general populace.

As the conversation continues to ignite on platforms like Twitter, there’s a prevailing call among certain segments of the public to demand accountability from political leaders. Specifically, some activists are urging their fellow citizens to consider action against the current administration, calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump. This escalating political rhetoric only adds to an already charged atmosphere, further complicating discussions around the ongoing ramifications of the debate.

In what has become a deeply polarized environment, the blurred lines between authentic grassroots movements and orchestrated foreign influence warrant a closer examination. As the landscape of U.S. politics continues to evolve, it becomes ever more critical for citizens to engage thoughtfully with the information they consume, fostering a more informed public discourse untainted by misleading external actors.",-9.0,1.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,422.0,0.06666666666666667,0.002369668246445498
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics firm overseen by billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a significant federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor, alleging employment discrimination. This lawsuit boldly accuses the company of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants during its hiring processes, raising critical questions about the integrity of federal contracting practices.

As a federal contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), Palantir's hiring practices are under heightened scrutiny. The Department of Labor's claims stem from an examination of applicants for engineering intern positions within the organization. According to the lawsuit, out of 130 applicants for these roles, a remarkable 73% were Asian. However, alarmingly, only four Asian applicants were hired, alongside 17 non-Asian hires. Such a stark contrast has sparked concerns not just about fairness in hiring but about the implications of organizational bias within a company that serves federal interests.

The discrepancy highlighted in the hiring data has led experts to calculate that the odds of this hiring pattern occurring by chance is roughly one in a billion, indicating a troubling systematic issue rather than a mere coincidence. The implications of these findings are particularly pressing given Palantir's influential role in providing data-driven solutions for U.S. intelligence agencies.

Peter Thiel, the company's co-founder, is no stranger to controversy. A first-generation immigrant himself, he has been known to express support for Donald Trump, a political figure who has campaigned against immigration and immigration reform. This juxtaposition raises an ironic tension within the narrative; a vocal proponent of anti-immigration policies appears to be out of step with his own immigrant background. Thiel's prominent status further complicates the situation, as he is not only a notable entrepreneur—having co-founded PayPal and being an early investor in Facebook—but also a figure whose actions have garnered national attention.

Earlier this year, Thiel captured headlines when he financed a lawsuit against Gawker Media that ultimately led to the company's bankruptcy. His involvement in high-stakes legal battles serves to underline his aggressive approach toward those he views as adversaries. However, his complex public persona was further illustrated at the Republican National Convention, where he made history as the first openly gay speaker to acknowledge his sexual orientation. In his speech, Thiel criticized government inefficiency and various regulations, including bathroom laws, which proved to stir both applause and controversy.

Despite the support he received during his speech, the broader Republican Party adopted a heavily anti-LGBT platform, illustrating the multifaceted and often contradictory nature of contemporary political affiliations within the GOP.

As the Department of Labor emphasizes, federal contractors like Palantir are mandated to ensure non-discriminatory hiring practices. This requirement is particularly critical given the highly sensitive nature of the work these contractors perform for national security. The lawsuit's claims bring to the forefront fundamental issues related to fairness and equality in employment—principles that underpin just hiring practices and, by extension, the integrity of federal contracts.

In response to the allegations, Palantir Technologies has categorically denied any bias in its hiring practices, expressing its intention to defend itself vigorously against the claims presented in the lawsuit. The company appears committed to demonstrating its adherence to the necessary standards expected of federal contractors, even as it faces serious allegations that could have lasting implications for its business and reputation.

As legal proceedings unfold, the implications of this case could extend beyond Palantir. It raises critical questions about diversity and equity in the tech sector, as well as the responsibilities of companies contracting with the government. The outcome may very well shape conversations about hiring practices and accountability in the realm of federal contracting, highlighting the pressing need for transparency in the hiring processes of organizations that play significant roles in national security.",-18.0,-9.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,704.0,-0.34615384615384615,-0.01278409090909091
Fake_65-Webpage,Note In Arabic Found With NYC Bomb… Call Says There Will Be More Bombings,"Note In Arabic Found With NYC Bomb… Call Says There Will Be More Bombings

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Authorities are intensifying their investigation into the bombing that shook Chelsea last Saturday, injuring 29 people and triggering a wave of panic across the city. The incident, which has drawn attention from law enforcement and news outlets alike, is being scrutinized in light of emerging evidence pointing to potential extremist motivations behind the attack.

In a disturbing development, a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster located just four blocks from the explosion site. This find raises alarms about the intent of the perpetrators and the possibility of additional attacks. As investigators parse through the details, they have identified three significant leads that offer insight into the mind of the individual or group behind these attacks.

One of the most notable pieces of evidence is a hand-written letter that was found in close proximity to the second bomb. The letter contains text partially written in Arabic, raising suspicions of a potential connection to Muslim extremists who may be claiming responsibility for the violent act. Authorities remain on high alert as they work to decipher the note and its implications for the ongoing investigation.

Adding to the tension, an unidentified male caller placed a 911 call, warning officials about the likelihood of further explosions. This chilling declaration, stating simply, “There will be more,” has amplified fears within the community and prompted an immediate response from law enforcement.

The investigation is also examining a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ which appears to serve as the bomber's manifesto. On this page, the individual claims that the explosives detonated in Chelsea were merely tests, a suggestion that further, more devastating attacks could follow. The motives outlined in the Tumblr post reveal a troubling commentary on societal issues, with the author expressing grievances related to discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community and leveling criticism at various political candidates.

The poster of the Tumblr message not only condemns societal standards but also utters a chilling vow to continue their violent actions, proclaiming, “This is just the beginning.” This declaration has sent shockwaves through the community and poses significant concern for public safety, with law enforcement tirelessly working to assess the credibility of these threats.

As the investigation into the Chelsea bombing unfolds, leading authorities warn against prematurely drawing conclusions or making baseless assumptions about the incident. The complex and evolving nature of such cases underscores the danger of misinformation, particularly in an era where false claims regarding responsibility for terrorist acts can cause significant distress and additional violence.

In the wake of such tragic events, community leaders and officials have come together to condemn the act of falsely claiming responsibility for acts of terrorism. Such actions undermine both the severity of actual terror incidents and the safety of the public. The imperative to approach these matters with careful consideration and respect for the victims is echoed across various community forums as people seek unity and healing in the face of adversity.

With ongoing investigations and the search for potential leads, police are urging anyone with information related to the bombing or the new threats to come forward. The community stands resilient, hoping for rapid development in the case that will bring those responsible to justice and restore a sense of safety to the vibrant streets of Chelsea. As the investigation continues, the city remains vigilant, supporting those affected while striving for both truth and justice.",-25.0,-41.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,630.0,-1.8636363636363635,-0.06507936507936508
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

*By Frank Wilkenmeyer*  
*September 25, 2016*

As the 2016 presidential campaign reaches a critical juncture, doubts about Donald Trump's mental fitness are coming to the forefront. With the impending debate against seasoned politician Hillary Clinton, Trump's state of mind is attracting significant scrutiny. 

At 70 years old, Trump is navigating a demanding campaign trail that has left him under considerable pressure. Recent observations suggest that he has not been able to manage the stress of the campaign effectively. In a striking example of his mental state, Trump held a last-minute rally in Roanoke, a decision that many interpret as high levels of stress and a desperate attempt to rally support.

His social media activity has raised even more alarms. Trump recently posted a tweet that was met with confusion and concern, where he linked three seemingly unrelated topics: murders committed by Middle Eastern immigrants, drug overdose deaths in Ohio, and riots occurring in North Carolina. This tweet has been described as incoherent and is seen by many as a sign of a wandering mind, raising questions about his readiness to engage in a critical debate.

The nature of Trump's mixed messaging has led to fears that he may be ill-equipped to face Clinton, a candidate known for her experience and preparedness. Political analysts are increasingly worried that these issues could signify a downward trajectory for Trump's campaign, particularly as voters look toward strong leadership and clarity in communication.

As the debate approaches, the pressure is mounting for Trump to demonstrate his fitness for office. However, the current signs raise significant questions about whether he can effectively counter his opponent's political acumen and experience. Given the rigorous demands of the campaign and his recent behavior, it remains to be seen how this may impact his chances in the election to come. 

In a political climate that prizes stability, confidence, and coherence, Trump's recent struggles could alter the trajectory of his candidacy, leaving many to wonder if he is truly prepared for the high-stakes debate that lies ahead.",-22.0,5.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,393.0,0.35714285714285715,0.01272264631043257

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474291954000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-HZMqIkGoU,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton.

In a striking display of dwindling support, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's recent door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, attracted only one attendee. The event, which aimed to rally local volunteers and energize her campaign, instead highlighted the challenges Clinton faces as she navigates a political landscape increasingly dominated by Donald Trump and his ardent supporters.

Things took a peculiar turn when a supporter of Donald Trump, armed with a camera, attended the event. As the supporter began filming the sparsely populated gathering, Clinton’s campaign staff quickly identified him and requested he vacate the premises. His presence drew attention not only because of the stark contrast it presented to the empty venue but also because of his remarks highlighting the low turnout compared to the exuberant crowds that typically gather at Trump rallies.

The underwhelming turnout raised eyebrows, particularly given the comprehensive preparations made by Clinton’s campaign office. With a significant expectation of volunteers, the absence of attendees prompted questions about the viability of her campaign in the current political climate, especially in light of Trump’s growing support.

The fiasco in Delaware is more than just an unfortunate incident; it hints at a larger trend within Clinton’s campaign efforts across the United States. The lack of interest displayed at the event may reflect a pervasive disengagement among voters, potentially signaling troubles ahead for her in key battleground states.

As speculations swirl regarding her viability as a candidate for the upcoming election, Clinton's challenges continue to multiply. Increasing enthusiasm for Trump is contrasting sharply with her campaign's struggles. This discrepancy in turnout and engagement could have lasting implications for her strategy moving forward, especially as the race heats up.

Clinton's political career has not been free from controversy, and her past decisions often resurface as points of criticism. Concerns about her health and stamina for the rigors of a national campaign also add layers of complexity for both her supporters and critics alike. Many wonder if she can galvanize a base that seems volatile amid a shifting political landscape dominated by a resurgence of Trumpism.

The Delaware event stands as a microcosm of the broader challenges Clinton faces as she attempts to secure the allegiance of voters who may now be more inclined toward Trump's message and larger-than-life rallies. The isolated incident is a vital indicator of potential difficulties she might encounter in successfully mobilizing support in future events and throughout her campaign.

As the 2024 election cycle progresses, this low turnout has instigated doubt among political commentators and analysts regarding the overall trajectory of Clinton’s campaign. With the current energy surrounding Trump's rallies, the question remains: Is Clinton able to reclaim momentum, inspire volunteer enthusiasm, and effectively counter the growing tide of support for her rival?

The results of the door-knocking event in Delaware serve as a sobering reminder of the unpredictable and often tumultuous nature of electoral politics. Unless Clinton can rally her supporters and restore confidence in her candidacy, this event may merely be the beginning of a series of struggles she will need to address going forward. As the race intensifies, both her strategy and health will be under heightened scrutiny as she looks to galvanize a resurgent grassroots movement amid the challenges that lay ahead.",-7.0,22.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,618.0,1.0,0.03559870550161812

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a bombing in New York City, immediate responses from political figures drew attention, especially comments made by former President Donald Trump. Trump characterized the incident as a “bombing,” a statement that drew scrutiny from various media outlets, notably CNN.

Despite Trump's accurate terminology, CNN criticized him for his remarks. Ironically, while CNN chastised Trump, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had previously used the same term to describe the incident. However, CNN later edited their coverage to omit Clinton’s use of the word “bombing,” leading to further criticism of the outlet’s editorial decisions.

In a later segment, CNN aired footage of Clinton acknowledging Trump’s comments but labeled him as “insensitive.” Yet, CNN excluded her previous use of the same term, an editing choice that raised eyebrows among viewers and analysts alike. This selective editing prompted backlash not only against CNN but also speculated about the media’s relationship with political narratives.

Trump himself responded to CNN's criticism during an interview on Fox and Friends. He described the network's coverage as “disgusting and disgraceful,” adding a pejorative reference to them as the “Clinton news network.” He stood firm on his characterization of the bombing, stating his belief that he was correct and expressing his discontent with the network’s portrayal of his comments as offensive. 

Beyond the immediate media reactions, Trump took the opportunity to critique current leadership, dubbing their policies concerning terrorism as “stupid” and insufficiently aggressive. He underscored his belief that the nation must adopt tougher strategies to combat terrorism and prevent similar incidents in the future, arguing that the present administration was not doing enough to protect the public.

Coinciding with these comments, Trump raised concerns regarding the influx of refugees into the United States, with particular criticism directed at former President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s plans to accept larger numbers. He argued that such policies could result in unvetted individuals entering the country, creating potential security risks. “We cannot allow thousands of unvetted individuals into our country,” Trump emphasized, aligning this sentiment with the broader context of the bombing and the implications of insufficient border control.

The series of events surrounding the bombing, along with the ensuing media narrative, has ignited discussions about governance, media responsibility, and national security. Trump’s remarks and the backlash against CNN have reignited long-standing debates regarding the balance of criticism and truthfulness in political discourse.

As the situation develops, reactions from various political figures and media outlets will undoubtedly continue to shape public perception and discourse surrounding both the bombing and broader geopolitical issues. The incident not only underscores the volatile nature of political communication but also highlights public concern over national safety in an era marked by increasing global instability.

In an environment rife with deeply divided political opinions, this bombing incident has catalyzed a renewed discussion on how best to approach national security in a world where threats can emerge suddenly and without warning. As leaders and news outlets navigate these fraught waters, the responsibility to address public fears while maintaining journalistic integrity remains paramount. 

Trump’s emphasis on a tougher stance towards terrorism, alongside his criticism of media portrayal following the incident, captures the intersection of media influence and political strategy in contemporary American politics—a dynamic that will likely continue to evolve as the nation reassesses its approach to security and governance.",-45.0,-27.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,654.0,-1.2857142857142858,-0.04128440366972477

Ahmad Rahami, the bomb suspect linked to several violent incidents, has filed a lawsuit against the police in Elizabeth, New Jersey, alleging discrimination against his family. The lawsuit comes amid serious allegations of racially motivated harassment and unfair treatment directed at the Rahami family, who have owned a family chicken restaurant since 2002.

Filed in federal court in Newark, the lawsuit claims that the Rahami family, originally hailing from Afghanistan, has been subjected to unwarranted scrutiny and harassment by local officials. Ahmad Rahami, 28, along with his father, Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother, have articulated claims of racial abuse, stating that members of the community have openly declared, ""Muslims don’t belong here."" The lawsuit paints a harrowing picture of the family's experiences in a community where they have worked for over two decades.

The Rahamis contend that during the years from April 2009 through 2011, the family faced numerous citations for allegedly violating local ordinances by remaining open past the mandated 10 PM closing time. They assert that these citations were unjust, as they had received permission to stay open later, suggesting a pattern of harassment targeting their business without legitimate grounds.

In the lawsuit, the Elizabeth police department is charged with having a ""reckless disregard"" for the Rahami family's constitutional rights. The legal documents indicate that officials have made statements regarding the business atmosphere in the area, reportedly claiming there was ""too much crime around here"" and referring to the community as known for criminal activity. These allegations have raised significant concerns about the motivations behind the police actions and whether racial profiling played a role in their treatment of the Rahami family.

Adding irony to the situation, just five years after the Rahamis began filing complaints regarding their treatment by local authorities, Ahmad Rahami was arrested for his involvement in planting bombs in New York and New Jersey. His arrest has prompted widespread speculation and scrutiny about the family's past and the effects of systemic discrimination on their circumstances. 

The implications of the lawsuit extend beyond the Rahami family, as it raises questions about the practices of law enforcement in communities comprised of diverse populations. It also highlights the ongoing national discourse regarding discrimination and the treatment of Muslim Americans.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the community remains divided on the issues presented, with debates surfacing over race, law enforcement practices, and the challenges of integrating different cultural identities within the fabric of American society. The case promises to unveil further discussion on the intersection of civil rights and public safety in today’s climate.",-49.0,-57.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,498.0,-3.5625,-0.1144578313253012
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

The Clinton Foundation is once again under scrutiny as allegations of pay-to-play corruption emerge, raising questions about the organization’s integrity during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. Critics contend that the foundation has functioned more as a profit-generating entity for the Clinton family and their associates than a bona fide charitable organization.

According to IRS filings from 2014, a startling 5.7% of the foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants. The fiscal year 2014 saw the foundation operate on a budget of nearly $91.3 million, with less than $5.2 million being directed toward charitable activities. This has led many to scrutinize the foundation's financial priorities. In stark contrast, a considerable portion of the budget, $34.8 million, went towards salaries and employee benefits, while a staggering $50.4 million was categorized as ""other expenses.""

Notably, despite receiving an additional $30 million in funding during 2014, the foundation's charitable expenditures declined by 40% compared to the previous year. This financial pattern raises concerns about the allocation of funds and the foundation’s mission. In the same year, expenditure for salaries and other expenses increased by $5 million, further amplifying doubts about the foundation's commitment to charitable work.

The situation has prompted the author to assert that the Clintons might have been leveraging their political influence for personal financial gain, implying a troubling nexus between political power and monetary rewards. Such claims foster an environment of mistrust, compelling stakeholders to reevaluate the foundation's role in philanthropic endeavors.

These circumstances lead to an unsettling conclusion: that the Clinton Foundation, rather than prioritizing its charitable objectives, has primarily served the financial interests of the Clintons and their inner circle. With scrutiny intensifying, the foundation’s operational transparency may be put to the test, as critics demand accountability for its fiscal practices.

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a recent speech delivered in New York, President Barack Obama has faced significant criticism for what many have labeled as tone-deafness in the wake of tragic events that marred the weekend. As communities in New York and New Jersey grappled with the aftermath of multiple bombings, alongside a stabbing incident reported in Minnesota, observers had expected a message of solidarity from the President. Instead, the focus of his address largely shifted to a high-dollar fundraiser and a critique of the media's portrayal of sexism, overlooking the urgent issues at hand.

The weekend events, marked by acts of domestic terrorism, left many in shock. As details emerged about bombings in urban locales and a violent incident in the Midwest, the public looked to their leader for empathy and reassurance. Critics anticipated that President Obama would seize the opportunity to address these critical issues, extending a message of condolences and strength to the affected individuals and families. Their expectations reflected a desire for national unity, particularly in the face of rising violence within the country's borders.

However, Obama’s decision to prioritize a fundraiser coupled with his commentary on media sexism drew outrage from various quarters. Instead of invoking the tragedies and acknowledging those who suffered, he praised Hillary Clinton and disparaged her opponent, Donald Trump. Many felt that the President’s focus on political rivalries and gender dynamics overshadowed the pressing need for awareness and mourning for the victims involved in the weekend's events.

The absence of any mention of the terrorist acts did not go unnoticed. Critics argued that even a simple acknowledgment or offer of prayers for the victims would have sufficed, given the lack of complete details regarding the bombings and stabbing. The outcry centered around a demographic yearning for leadership rooted in sensitivity and recognition of shared loss during difficult times.

In the wake of such unprecedented violence, the critics highlighted that the President’s speech left a void where compassion and connection should have thrived. They pointed out that effective leadership often hinges on the ability to unite the nation during moments of crisis which, according to them, President Obama failed to achieve in this instance.

The juxtaposition of a high-profile fundraising event against the backdrop of such serious incidents raised questions about the impact of the President’s priorities in this critical moment. Fragmented sentiments of anger, disbelief, and disappointment poured in from various individuals and organizations who felt sidelined by a lack of direct engagement with the crises that unfolded.

In reviewing the speech, it is apparent that a significant segment of the populace yearned for a clearer acknowledgment of their struggles and fears in the face of escalating violence. The expectation from a President is, at times, to transcend partisanship in order to bolster collective resilience; a role that many feel was neglected during Obama's remarks.

As discussions continue about the nature of leadership in moments of national distress, this event serves as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance required in presidential rhetoric. Emphasizing dialogue and understanding during troubled times may play an essential role in fostering a sense of community and healing amongst a fragmented nation, something that many argue was absent in President Obama’s recent speech.

Overall, the reaction to the President’s address underscores the need for leaders to remain relatable and sensitive to the needs and sentiments of the populace, particularly during challenging circumstances that affect the fabric of society at large.",-25.0,-48.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,650.0,-2.1818181818181817,-0.07384615384615385
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

Public awareness surrounding the Clinton Foundation's activities has intensified as reports emerge regarding potential corruption during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A recent draft congressional report highlights serious allegations involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a prominent branch of the foundation.

The report claims that CHAI allegedly distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa, a practice that could have dire consequences for patient health. The findings indicate that this distribution may have increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients dependent on these essential treatments.

As one of the foundation’s key initiatives, CHAI's credibility is now under the microscope. The potential dissemination of adulterated drugs raises significant concerns, especially as Hillary Clinton prepares for her presidential campaign, with the foundation already facing heightened scrutiny.

Emerging details from the report underscore additional concerns regarding Bill Clinton’s connections to certain Indian-American individuals who are currently under investigation by the FDA and SEC. Notably, evidence suggests that the Clinton Foundation actively promoted Ranbaxy, a company notorious for its history of inadequate quality control and fraudulent practices involving the FDA.

Despite the gravity of these allegations, the extent of the patient population affected by the distribution of compromised medications remains uncertain. Nevertheless, the implications of these findings have fueled calls for increased oversight of the Clinton charity, particularly in light of its commitment to public health and safety.

Amidst growing concerns, some argue that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down to prevent any further harm. As the public grapples with these revelations, the foundation's future hangs in the balance, promising to become a pivotal issue in forthcoming political discussions. As the investigation unfolds, the calls for transparency and accountability are becoming louder, potentially impacting the dynamics of the upcoming electoral landscape.",-14.0,-18.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,349.0,-1.3846153846153846,-0.05157593123209169
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is facing significant criticism for laws that are poorly worded and adversely affect parenting activities. Among the most contentious regulations is a law that criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals, creating distress among parents and caregivers who may now inadvertently be labeled as felons due to routine acts of child care.

This controversial legislation, aimed at safeguarding children from potential molesters, has instead produced a disconcerting reality where essential parenting activities such as changing diapers or bathing children could lead to legal repercussions for unsuspecting parents. Critics argue that the law's poorly constructed language leaves too much room for misinterpretation, resulting in unintended and alarming consequences.

Despite these concerns, the Arizona Supreme Court recently upheld the law, asserting that the likelihood of prosecuting innocent conduct is minimal. However, the ruling raises additional issues, as defendants under this law are required to demonstrate a lack of sexual intent. Legal experts have voiced their apprehension that this shift represents an erosion of the presumption of innocence, a fundamental principle of justice.

The implications of this law extend beyond mere legalese. Many residents now find themselves in precarious positions, unwittingly categorized as criminals due to ambiguously defined statutes. Parents face the looming threat of prosecution not for malicious intent but for engaging in basic caregiving responsibilities—a notion that has incited widespread outcry among advocates for parental rights.

Concerns surrounding plea bargaining and prosecutorial coercion have become front and center in discussions about the law's application. This particular aspect has raised alarms for parents and caregivers, with fears that they may be pressured into pleading guilty to avoid protracted legal battles, further undermining their rights. This situation has led to assertions from legal experts who argue that the law has effectively been weaponized for prosecutorial harassment.

In a state where the legislation intended to protect children could paradoxically jeopardize the very parents working to nurture and care for them, the conversation surrounding this law is only beginning to unfold. Many Arizona residents are demanding clarity and reform, fearing that without intervention from higher authorities, the due process rights of parents and caregivers may be significantly compromised.

As the debate continues to swirl, Arizona's legislature faces calls for a thorough reevaluation of the law's language and intent. Advocates argue that a focus on more clearly defined protections, aimed specifically at preventing child molestation without punishing innocent parenting behavior, is necessary to strike a fair balance.

The outcome of this legal quagmire may ultimately rest with the U.S. Supreme Court, as the potential for broader implications looms. The hope among critics is that intervention at the national level can provide the necessary clarity and protect the rights of the innocent, ensuring that parenting activities remain shielded from criminalization. The conversation surrounding these laws has engendered both anger and concern across the state, signaling the urgent need for reexamination of how laws impacting family dynamics are crafted and enforced.",-12.0,-26.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,550.0,-1.3,-0.04727272727272727
Fake_73-Webpage,Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?,"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape heats up ahead of the upcoming election, speculation is rising regarding Michelle Obama’s possible involvement in a Hillary Clinton administration, should the former Secretary of State emerge victorious. This speculation forms part of a broader dialogue surrounding the influential role of both women in shaping policies that pertain to education and children’s welfare. However, as admiration for the Obamas endures, criticism has also resurfaced, particularly concerning Michelle Obama’s legacy and initiatives.

Michelle Obama has made her mark on child nutrition and education through campaigns aimed at encouraging healthy lifestyles among children. Her signature initiative, “Let’s Move!”, has been pivotal in promoting physical activity and balanced diets among youth. Despite this, detractors have raised concerns over the efficacy and reach of her efforts. Critics have suggested that while her intentions were commendable, the results have not produced the profound societal shift she envisioned. As debates continue over the impact of such initiatives, they have ignited contentious discussions about the role of government in shaping upbringing and educational initiatives for children.

In conjunction with the discourse on Michelle Obama’s initiatives, Hillary Clinton's views have added another layer of complexity. Clinton has long advocated for the government’s participation in various aspects of family life, including education, which has triggered concerns among certain voter segments. Critics argue that the intersection of governmental influence and child-rearing could lead to overreach, infringing on parental rights and traditional family structures. As the campaign progresses, the potential for Clinton’s administration to leverage these aspects presents a daunting prospect for voters wary of progressive ideologies encroaching on family and education.

In light of these evolving dynamics, Michelle Obama has reiterated her commitment to her initiatives focused on healthy living for children. She has stated that her involvement in this work is not merely a campaign phase but rather a lifelong commitment. This allegiance to her projects may resonate positively with voters who admire the Obamas and their endeavors. However, this admiration poses a double-edged sword, considering that their public persona could simultaneously alienate voters apprehensive about a Clinton administration’s stance on family and educational reforms.

Interestingly, some observers suggest that the possible alignment of Michelle Obama with a Hillary Clinton administration could be politically strategic. It could serve to attract voters who have supported the Obama legacy, showcasing a united front that emphasizes progressivism. Yet, this strategy is fraught with risk, particularly in a political climate where many individuals express deep discomfort with progressive ideologies, especially when it involves the education of children.

Amidst these discussions, voices opposing government encroachment on child-rearing have become increasingly prominent. There is a palpable unease with the notion of political leaders influencing children’s education and wellness strategies—a sentiment strongly echoed by parents and advocacy groups who fear that such measures may prioritize political agendas over family values and needs.

As the chips fall in the lead-up to election day, the question of Michelle Obama's involvement in a possible Hillary Clinton administration remains unanswered. Both the benefits of her initiatives and the criticisms surrounding them will shape the narrative as voters deliberate the potential implications of a shift towards progressive policies governing children’s education and welfare. With this conversation ongoing, it is essential for voters to remain vigilant, ensuring their family values are preserved in the face of evolving political strategies and ideologies.

As more details unfold and the election approaches, the implications of Michelle Obama’s legacy and her potential role in a Clinton administration will be crucial topics that define this election cycle.",6.0,20.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,683.0,0.8,0.029282576866764276

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A fresh wave of controversy is engulfing the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a non-profit organization founded by former President Bill Clinton in 2002. Recent allegations indicate possible corruption linked to the Clintons, raising significant questions about their involvement and oversight regarding the health initiatives they have championed, particularly in the realm of HIV/AIDS treatment in sub-Saharan Africa.

Central to this unfolding story are allegations that CHAI distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDS medications, which have purportedly led to increased morbidity and mortality among patients reliant on these life-saving drugs. The implications of these accusations are dire, especially considering the vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa that often have no alternative access to effective treatment.

The reports point to Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy as the supplier of these controversial drugs. In 2013, Ranbaxy was found guilty of multiple counts of fraud, highlighting issues surrounding the quality of its medication. This history of legal troubles raises crucial concerns as legislators scrutinize the broader ramifications of these allegations.

Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who has taken a keen interest in this issue, initiated a congressional report aimed at investigating the circumstances surrounding CHAI’s decision to work with Ranbaxy. During her inquiry, Blackburn expressed alarm over the possible loss of lives due to the distribution of substandard health products. Her comments underline the gravity of medications that do not meet the necessary standards of efficacy, particularly when such drugs are administered to populations battling life-threatening diseases.

The congressional report has outlined troubling connections between Bill Clinton and individuals linked to Ranbaxy, despite known warnings regarding the company’s quality control deficiencies. This revelation raises significant questions about the level of diligence exercised by the Clintons in overseeing the initiatives linked to their names, especially when dealing with a supplier that has a shadowed history.

Compounding the matter, funding allocated to Ranbaxy from the U.S. Agency for International Development rose steeply in 2007. This funding is now under scrutiny due to the company's ongoing reputation for producing substandard medications that have drawn criticism from public health experts and advocates alike. The decision to allocate such significant resources to a firm with a problematic track record has been met with frustration from various advocacy groups who work tirelessly to ensure that patients receive safe and effective treatments.

Despite Ranbaxy’s ban from selling drugs in the United States due to quality issues, the company has maintained its ability to distribute HIV/AIDS medications on a global scale. This raises the question of why the Clintons have yet to sever ties with the company in light of the allegations. Critics suggest that financial incentives may take precedence over patient welfare, particularly in marginalized communities that suffer disproportionately from inadequate healthcare resources.

As this controversy develops, the implications for the Clinton Health Access Initiative are potentially far-reaching. The initiative was widely hailed as a significant effort to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medications and improve access for those who need it most. However, the newfound allegations could tarnish the initiative’s reputation, calling into question its operational integrity and commitment to ethical standards.

Public reaction has been mixed, with some expressing outrage over the alleged mismanagement and exploitation of vulnerable populations. Others have noted that these accusations highlight a broader systemic issue within the global health landscape, wherein profit margins can sometimes overshadow patient safety and effective treatment.

The fallout from Rep. Blackburn's investigation is likely to unfold over the coming months, as additional scrutiny on both CHAI and Ranbaxy may bring to light further discrepancies or potentially culpable behavior. Advocates for those affected by HIV/AIDS are calling for accountability and transparency within organizations that claim to prioritize health initiatives, especially when they involve partnerships with companies that have exhibited a lack of fidelity to ethical practices.

In summation, the controversy surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its connection to Ranbaxy illustrates the complex interplay of healthcare, corporate ethics, and the responsibility of non-profit organizations and their leaders. As existing patients and their families search for assurance in the quality of the medications they receive, the urgency for answers in this situation becomes increasingly crucial. The debate over whether financial gain has been prioritized over the well-being of patients remains at the forefront, demanding a thorough investigation into the actions and decisions of those involved.

The issues raised by this scenario highlight the necessity for vigilant oversight in the distribution of medications that are critical for life preservation, particularly in communities that depend on such support. The stakes have never been higher as researchers, lawmakers, and healthcare advocates rally for a system that ensures safety, efficacy, and ethical responsibility in global health initiatives.",-63.0,-16.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,858.0,-0.5333333333333333,-0.018648018648018648

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant development surrounding the ongoing scrutiny of security protocols at the State Department, a federal judge has ordered the agency to release key documents concerning security training provided to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. The ruling, delivered by Judge Richard Leon, mandates the State Department to produce the requested documents within five days, underscoring growing frustrations over delays in transparency regarding past operations.

The case was initiated by the Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which has actively pursued these documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. This legal action aims to shed light on whether Clinton and her aides received mandatory security training during their tenure in office. The State Department has faced criticism for its handling of the request and had previously attempted to dismiss the lawsuit altogether, a motion that Judge Leon ultimately rejected, emphasizing the importance of timely disclosure in public interest matters.

Central to the lawsuit are records detailing security training for several key figures in Clinton’s team, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The requested documentation is critical in assessing compliance with security training protocols, especially in the context of significant concerns raised about Clinton’s handling of classified information during her time as Secretary of State.

Judge Leon's order reflects his dissatisfaction with the State Department's ongoing delays and what he referred to as ""foot-dragging"" in fulfilling requests for information. This reflects a broader concern about accountability and transparency within federal agencies when it comes to documenting compliance with security procedures. The ruling now compels the State Department to expedite its review and release of the pertinent documents.

As part of this ruling, one-third of the approximately 400 documents requested are due to be released by September 26, with the remaining records to be made available by October 10. This timeline presents a crucial opportunity for the public to gain insight into the security training measures that were purportedly undertaken—or not undertaken—by Clinton and her aides. 

Notably, the State Department has already conceded that the records indicate a lack of completion of the mandatory security training courses by Clinton and her senior staff. This revelation raises further questions about protocol adherence and the rigorousness of security training programs designed to equip officials with the necessary tools to manage classified information safely.

The ruling also ignites renewed discussion and scrutiny into the implementation and effectiveness of security training within the State Department and other federal agencies. As security risks evolve, maintaining rigorous training and compliance is essential to safeguarding sensitive information and upholding national security interests.

The backlash against the State Department’s initial reluctance to release the requested documents highlights not only the legal but also the ethical responsibility of government agencies to be transparent in their operations. Instances of resistance to information requests can fuel public skepticism about governmental accountability, particularly concerning high-profile figures such as Clinton, who has faced intense scrutiny regarding her email use and security protocols during her tenure.

The outcome of this ruling could have significant implications for ongoing discussions about governmental transparency and the security measures in place for officials at all levels. As the deadline for document release approaches, stakeholders will closely monitor the situation to gauge the implications of the available information on public perception and historical assessments of security protocols within the State Department.

In conclusion, Judge Richard Leon's ruling serves as a critical moment in the quest for transparency regarding the security training of Hillary Clinton and her aides. As the court sets stringent deadlines for the submission of documents, the public awaits details that could profoundly impact discussions about security practices in government agencies and accountability measures for officials wielding sensitive information.",-5.0,11.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,701.0,0.5,0.015691868758915834
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the nation gears up for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, all eyes are on Lester Holt, who has been appointed as the moderator. In an era where fact-checking has become increasingly vital in political discourse, NBC News has hinted that Holt will not engage in fact-checking during the debate. This decision raises concerns about the potential implications for accountability during the heated exchange.

By not fact-checking the candidates in real-time, the debate may create a scenario where Trump can make unaccountable statements, while Clinton bears the added burden of countering misinformation. Major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, are expected to follow suit by not providing on-screen fact-checks, compounding the challenge for Holt. Given the media's apparent prioritization of viewer ratings over accountability, Trump may face less scrutiny during the debate.

A report from Politico has drawn attention to the frequency of untruths in Trump's statements, indicating he lies approximately every three-and-a-half minutes. This statistic underscores the pressing need for rigorous fact-checking during a platform that significantly influences public perception. Without this, Holt's role transcends mere moderation and becomes a pivotal point in maintaining the integrity of the debate.

Clinton's campaign is consciously strategizing to hold Trump accountable, while also navigating the extra scrutiny placed upon her. The double standard evident in this dynamic is raising alarms—Clinton finds herself in a position where she must exert additional effort to convey her competence in light of potential misinformation by her opponent. Critics worry that without consistent fact-checking support, Clinton may struggle to effectively convince voters of her superiority.

The implications of this debate extend beyond the candidates themselves, reflecting broader concerns about the current state of journalism in the election landscape. As voters tune in, the question remains: can a single moderator adequately ensure a fair and honest debate, particularly when major media outlets opt out of supporting fact-checking initiatives? The effectiveness of Holt's moderation will likely play a critical role in shaping voters' perceptions and, ultimately, the race leading up to the election.

As the stage is set for a face-off between two political heavyweights, the pressure on Holt intensifies. Will he rise to the occasion and uphold the standards of objective journalism, or will the debate reflect a growing trend of unchecked rhetoric from candidates? The upcoming presidential debate stands not just as a pivotal event for the candidates but also as a litmus test for media responsibility in safeguarding democracy.",-6.0,10.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,471.0,0.5555555555555556,0.021231422505307854
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

Dolly Kyle, a long-time friend of former President Bill Clinton, has publicly criticized Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency, asserting that her character and health pose significant concerns for her candidacy. In her scathing assessment, Kyle argues that Clinton is driven by “anger and rage,” emotions that she believes could lead the former Secretary of State to experience physical breakdowns if she assumes the role of president.

Kyle has gone further to claim that Clinton suffers from cognitive impairment, suggesting that this mental decline compromises her ability to carry out presidential duties. According to Kyle, symptoms exhibited by Clinton include emotional instability, memory loss, and challenges with completing complex tasks. These allegations raise questions about Clinton's mental acuity and whether she is physically fit to assume the responsibilities of the highest office in the country.

Adding to her critique, Kyle describes Clinton as exhibiting characteristics of paranoia, coupled with an overwhelming need for control. She argues that these traits could be detrimental to a president, who must navigate the complexities of leadership and governance in a stable and rational manner. Such perceptions of emotional volatility might hinder public and political trust, essential commodities for any aspiring leader.

To express her views, Kyle has authored a book titled ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" in which she seeks to unveil the troubling aspects of Clinton’s character and health that she believes could hinder her presidential aspirations. Through this work, Kyle aims to provide insight into why she considers Clinton unfit for the job she seeks.

The implications of Kyle's assertions are compounded by her characterization of Clinton as being ""addicted to power."" This dependency, according to Kyle, drives Clinton to prioritize her ambitions over her well-being and, by extension, the interests of the Democratic Party. This perspective adds another layer of complexity to the already challenging landscape Clinton faces in her political career.

With the backdrop of ongoing health and character controversies surrounding her, Kyle's remarks threaten to further complicate Clinton's quest to maintain a positive public image. As the electoral landscape continues to unfold, questions regarding Clinton's capability to govern effectively remain at the forefront of public discussion, influenced by the allegations that emerge from individuals in her past.",-13.0,-13.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,435.0,-0.8666666666666667,-0.029885057471264367

In a nation historically defined by its immigrant population, the conversation surrounding the integration of newcomers into American culture has taken on renewed urgency. While the United States has welcomed individuals from diverse backgrounds, there is a pronounced emphasis on the expectation that immigrants adapt to the customs and traditions that characterize American life, rather than maintaining their original practices.

This sentiment echoes in Canada, where a Quebec mayor recently articulated the importance of immigrants understanding the necessity of adapting to Canadian values and lifestyles. He boldly asserted that Canadians are not inherently racist; rather, they hold a firm expectation that newcomers will respect and assimilate into the local culture. This perspective highlights a key aspect of the national discourse: a call for immigrants to not merely coexist but to actively engage with and embrace the prevailing cultural norms.

The mayor also spoke to the municipality’s authority to withhold concessions related to Islamic practices and Sharia law, underscoring a belief that local governance should reflect the cultural characteristics of the community it serves. His perspective sheds light on the nuanced attitudes towards immigration that exist within Canada, contrasting sharply with practices observed in many Muslim-majority countries. He expressed frustration toward individuals who seem to operate under the assumption that they can dictate the lives of others, or those who expect fundamental changes to the established local culture as a result of their presence.

In Texas, similar themes resonate as legislative action is underway to prohibit the introduction of Sharia law within the state’s judicial framework. This legislative movement underscores a prevailing belief among some lawmakers that while minorities enrich the cultural fabric of society, they should not endeavor to alter or redefine the dominant culture but should instead adapt to it. The implications of these sentiments extend beyond individual perspectives; they reflect an overarching societal message advocating for either integration into the established culture or a departure from it.

The insistence on integration has sparked varied reactions among different stakeholders. Proponents assert that assimilation fosters social cohesion and unity, allowing immigrants to become active contributors to the nation while preserving the integrity of the mainstream culture. They argue that a shared set of values and practices can serve as the foundation for enhanced mutual understanding and a stronger society.

Conversely, critics of this viewpoint caution against defining integration too narrowly. They argue that the rich tapestry of American and Canadian cultures can be enhanced, rather than diminished, by the diverse practices and traditions brought by immigrants. This dialogue raises essential questions about identity, belonging, and the nature of cultural exchange in societies built upon principles of pluralism and diversity.

As communities navigate the complexities of demographic shifts and evolving cultural identities, the insistence on integration continues to serve as a guiding principle for many. This ongoing dialogue reflects a broader societal aspiration: to strike a balance between honoring the contributions of immigrants while ensuring respect for the established cultural frameworks that shape national and local identities.

In the coming months, both in the United States and Canada, how these discussions evolve will likely influence policies regarding immigration and integration significantly. As the narrative unfolds, it remains critical to find pathways that foster unity while respecting the fabric of cultural diversity that defines these nations. Ultimately, the call for integration or departure reverberates through communities, asking difficult questions about the future of immigration and cultural identity in America and beyond.",12.0,17.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,636.0,0.7727272727272727,0.026729559748427674

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a startling incident that unfolded amidst ongoing riots in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by a group of Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through the unrest. Eyewitness accounts describe a scene filled with tension as protesters took to the streets to voice their concerns.

Initially, bystanders expressed concern for the man's safety, with many fearing he might be mugged or confronted due to the volatile atmosphere surrounding him. The roar of crowds and the spirited chants of protesters created an air of uncertainty that left observers on edge. However, what occurred next was unexpected and led to a swift change in the situation.

As the man rolled down his window, he revealed a handgun that was visible to the protesters. This display prompted an immediate and unexpected reaction. Instead of escalating the situation, the protesters quickly dispersed, allowing him to continue on his journey without incident. The rapid change in dynamics raised eyebrows and prompted discussions among witnesses regarding the appropriateness of the man's response to the tense encounter.

The incident has sparked debate about the nature of protest environments and safety. While some believe that displaying a firearm may have been a necessary action for self-defense in a charged atmosphere, others question whether this was, in fact, the right way to navigate such an encounter. 

The tension between groups advocating for social justice and those who feel threatened by protests can often lead to precarious situations. The man's decision to communicate his readiness to defend himself raises crucial questions about the intersection of personal safety and community activism.

As communities continue to grapple with issues surrounding race and protest, incidents like these serve as a reminder of the complexities involved. Whether the man's strategy was justified or misguided, it underscores the challenges individuals face in uncertain times during protests, where the motivations and responses of each party can significantly alter the course of events. The discourse surrounding this encounter is likely to evolve as more voices weigh in on the implications of such an action.",-18.0,-19.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,389.0,-1.1875,-0.04884318766066838

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago environmentalists are under scrutiny for their contrasting stances on two high-profile projects: George Lucas's proposed museum and the Obama Presidential Center. While environmental advocates have rallied against the Lucas Museum, slated for a parking lot near the city’s waterfront, many have openly supported the construction of the Obama Center in Jackson Park, leading to claims of hypocrisy.

Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, has been a vocal proponent of the Obama Center. This strong support raises eyebrows among critics who remember the two-year effort by the environmentalists to block the Lucas project. The opposition to Lucas's museum was couched in environmental concerns over the site’s impact, but the Obama Center's construction reportedly entails the removal of trees and grass, igniting debate over the integrity of the environmentalists' priorities.

Critics are now questioning the underlying reasons for the different reactions to the two developments, with some suggesting a link to ""white privilege."" This concept has sparked conversations about the varying degrees of advocacy based on the perceived value of each project, emphasizing the complexities of local politics in Chicago.

As the debate unfolds, it brings to light broader questions regarding the environmental commitments of local organizations. The accusation of hypocrisy might suggest that environmental stances can be influenced by political and social dynamics rather than a steadfast commitment to ecological preservation. The Chicago group's actions in these two cases may signal a shift in the dialogue surrounding urban development and environmentalism, leaving many to wonder about the future of advocacy in the city.",3.0,6.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,301.0,0.6,0.019933554817275746

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

Tensions escalated between McChrystal and Commander-in-Chief Barack Obama over differing views on the conduct of the war, ultimately prompting a high-stakes meeting in the Oval Office.

During this critical encounter, McChrystal arrived anticipating the end of his Army career. President Obama confronted him with accusations of political disloyalty, suggesting that McChrystal had failed to support him adequately during a tumultuous period of U.S. military engagements. In response, McChrystal reaffirmed his commitment to the presidency, underscoring the duty he felt to support Obama as Commander-in-Chief. This interaction culminated in McChrystal submitting his resignation, marking a notable end to his military tenure.

Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm.

Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has become the focal point of escalating unrest, drawing attention to the alarming dynamics of recent riots. Reports indicate that over 70% of the rioters involved in these protests were not local residents, as evidenced by their identification cards. This raises critical questions about the origins of the unrest and the motivations behind these demonstrations.

The leadership within the Charlotte police union has echoed similar sentiments, labeling these individuals as ""professional criminals."" According to sources, these rioters were allegedly organized and bused into the city for the express purpose of inciting chaos, thereby painting a picture of an orchestrated event rather than a spontaneous local response to grievances. The suggestion that external elements are manipulating local communities for their purposes has fueled concerns among residents and officials alike.

This situation in Charlotte has drawn comparisons to the protests observed in Tulsa, Oklahoma. While both cities have experienced civil unrest, the protests in Tulsa have notably been less violent than those in Charlotte. Observers note that community sentiment in Tulsa has shown a lack of sympathy towards the Black Lives Matter movement, which may have influenced the tone and intensity of the protests. Compounding this, a police officer involved in a recent shooting in Tulsa was charged with manslaughter, a legal consequence that may have helped to defuse tensions in that community.

The unrest in Charlotte, however, appears to be exacerbated by the narrative of chaos. Some individuals are suggesting that the riots are not merely reactions to isolated incidents but rather elements of a broader communist agenda aimed at inciting chaos and racial conflict across America. This perspective posits that external radicals are utilizing local communities as pawns in a larger game of discord, instigating violence and disorder to further their political aims.

The implications of these events extend beyond the immediate violence on the streets of Charlotte. Many residents are now questioning the narratives around these protests and the identities of those leading the charge. The belief that outside forces are leveraging local discontent for their own ends adds a layer of complexity to the discourse surrounding civil rights and police accountability.

The police response to these organized protests has been met with mixed reactions from the community. Many residents express a sense of bewilderment, struggling to process the presence of individuals who do not share their home or personal experiences, yet are actively engaging in protests that claim to represent local concerns.

As Charlotte continues to grapple with its recent turmoil, it remains essential to differentiate between organic grassroots movements that address legitimate grievances and orchestrated events that may have ulterior motives. The dichotomy between local and out-of-state participants has raised questions about the authenticity of the protests and their implications for community cohesion.

Moving forward, finding a way to engage with the community and address the underlying issues fueling resentment will be crucial. Local leaders need to foster an environment where residents feel heard and valued, rather than seeing their community exploited by individuals with differing agendas. 

In conclusion, Charlotte’s riots reveal a complex web of local and external influences affecting civil protest. The characterization of rioters as professionals engaged in organized efforts underscores the challenges faced by local law enforcement and community leaders alike. As the divide between local sentiments and national movements widens, the path to understanding and reconciliation remains fraught with challenges, requiring a concerted effort to ensure that constructive dialogue prevails over chaos and conflict.",-17.0,-63.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,647.0,-2.52,-0.0973724884080371
Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

As the presidential campaign heats up, Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a contentious issue, drawing considerable attention and speculation. Allegations regarding her health have intensified, with claims suggesting she may be suffering from serious conditions, including neurological diseases.

The scrutiny surrounding Clinton escalated following her collapse during a public event on September 11th, marking a shift in media support. Reports have begun to circulate questioning the authenticity of her public appearances, with expert Clif Hite proposing a sensational theory that Clinton has died and is now being replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If proven true, such a theory would indicate a remarkable political cover-up.

Compounding the situation, Russian intelligence has allegedly leveraged video footage to support claims that Clinton is using body doubles and has not ventured outside Chelsea Clinton’s apartment since the incident. Additionally, there are rumors regarding Clinton's potential involvement in a secret plane crash, which purportedly left her with serious injuries. Initially met with skepticism, some sources have since deemed these reports credible, adding weight to the ongoing discussions.

As this narrative continues to unfold, the public is invited to weigh in on the curious circumstances surrounding Clinton's health. Are these claims credible? Was she injured or even killed in a plane crash, only to be replaced by CGI? The debate is likely to continue as the campaign progresses, keeping the focus squarely on her health.",-28.0,-20.0,272.0,-1.6470588235294117,-0.10294117647058823,277.0,-1.6666666666666667,-0.07220216606498195
Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right?

In an increasingly polarized political climate, a new wave of organized efforts is emerging to challenge the administration of Donald Trump, particularly in relation to his stance on immigration and social justice. The group Discover the Networks has recently unveiled a list of 187 organizations funded by prominent financier George Soros that are vocally opposing the Trump presidency. Among these, the Common Defense PAC stands out with its unique focus on attracting military veterans to its cause.

Operating under the slogan, “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump,” Common Defense PAC positions itself as a defender of American values, leveraging the credibility of military service. However, scrutiny of the organization reveals potential issues regarding transparency. While the PAC’s website prominently features military veterans as part of its campaign, it notably lacks any contact information for those individuals, raising questions about the authenticity of their claims and representation.

The PAC has garnered attention through its promotion of anti-Trump content, including videos connected to the advocacy group MoveOn.org. This collaboration extends to the use of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, illustrating a joint effort to mobilize opposition against the current administration. Furthermore, Common Defense PAC is participating in a Thunderclap campaign designed to put pressure on politicians to speak out against Trump, benefitting from considerable social media reach. Notable figures such as actor Mark Ruffalo and political commentator Van Jones have lent their support to these efforts, amplifying the PAC's visibility.

The connection between Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org is further emphasized by their collaborative actions, which include organizing protest rallies. An example of this was a rally aimed at urging Senator John McCain to publicly disavow Trump. This strategic alliance seeks to strengthen the message that Trump’s presidency is detrimental to the values they hold dear.

However, an analysis of Common Defense PAC's financial report reveals a stark reality regarding its grassroots support. The organization lists only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This singular source of funding raises concerns about the breadth of support for the PAC’s initiatives and suggests that it may primarily rely on high-profile funding rather than a broad base of individual supporters.

The leadership of Common Defense PAC further complicates the narrative surrounding its representation of veterans. Perry O’Brien, the director of the PAC, is described as a long-time left-wing activist and conscientious objector. Such a background raises pivotal questions about the authenticity of the group's claim to represent the veteran community, as critics may argue that O'Brien's political leanings could influence the PAC's messaging and objectives.

As these leftist-funded organizations rally in their efforts to exert pressure on Trump, an essential question arises regarding the effectiveness of this coordinated opposition. Will Trump be able to withstand the barrage of well-organized campaigns targeting him on multiple fronts, particularly when they leverage the credibility and moral weight of military veterans? The outcomes of such efforts could significantly impact the broader political landscape and influence public perception of both the Trump administration and the groups that oppose it.

In summary, the emergence of groups like Common Defense PAC highlights the heightened activism among left-leaning organizations seeking to challenge the prevailing political narrative. With financial backing from George Soros and strategic alliances with established advocacy movements, these organizations are mobilizing to sway public opinion against Donald Trump. However, questions of transparency, grassroots support, and authentic representation of veterans paint a complex picture of just how influential these groups might be in the long term. As the political battleground evolves, the effectiveness of such efforts will remain a focal point of discussion among both supporters and detractors of the current administration.",8.0,34.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,706.0,1.2592592592592593,0.04815864022662889

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

In a story that has resurfaced amid ongoing economic concerns, CBS reported that the Obama administration allocated a substantial sum of $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas. While this allocation originates from 2015, it has garnered renewed scrutiny due to its implications amidst current economic challenges facing the United States.

Critics of the funding have pointed to the potential dangers of such expenditures, arguing that these funds may inadvertently support Islamic terrorists. The contentious nature of this funding raises questions regarding the motivations behind directing U.S. taxpayer dollars toward projects involving foreign Islamic institutions, especially given the precarious state of the U.S. economy where many citizens are grappling with unemployment.

Taxpayer advocates have expressed outrage over what they see as fiscal irresponsibility. With reports indicating that one-third of Americans are currently unemployed, many argue that the U.S. government should prioritize domestic needs over foreign projects. These advocates are particularly concerned about the allocation of significant taxpayer resources for renovations that could be construed as favoring particular religious groups, at a time when Americans are struggling to make ends meet.

The State Department has defended the initiative, asserting that the renovations are part of a broader strategy aimed at combating Islamic extremism. Officials argue that fostering relationships with Islamic leaders through such funding is a suitable approach to promote stability and understanding in regions where extremism thrives. However, this justification has not been well received by many, who remain skeptical of whether monetary support for foreign religious institutions genuinely serves the American public's interests or enhances national security.

Moreover, concerns have been raised about the wider implications tied to U.S. financial support of Islamic entities abroad. Critics argue that such funding could undermine national security interests, suggesting that the funds may contribute indirectly to terrorism, despite the official rationale offered by government representatives. Additionally, there are apprehensions regarding the demographic shifts occurring as a result of policies surrounding the resettlement of Muslim refugees, with some asserting that these changes could alter the fabric of American society.

The controversy surrounding the renovation funding has not only highlighted the dichotomy between domestic financial challenges and foreign spending but has also sparked a public dialogue about the priorities of U.S. government funds. As Americans face economic hardship and rising unemployment numbers, the allocation of such a significant amount of taxpayer dollars to overseas projects has raised critical questions about transparency and accountability in governmental budgeting processes.

While the policy may have been established with the intention of bolstering relationships and reducing extremism, the lingering doubts from various factions reveal a troubling undercurrent. Many Americans find it difficult to reconcile the notion of funding foreign religious infrastructure with the pressing needs of their own communities, begging the question of whether the U.S. would be better served by focusing on internal issues first.

As discussions continue about the best approach to support both national security and community welfare, the allocation of funds to renovate mosques abroad highlights a broader struggle within the country. The tension between international diplomacy and domestic priorities remains a focal point for debate, and for many, it calls into question the direction of U.S. foreign policy in relation to its people’s most urgent needs.

As the criticism grows, voices advocating for a re-evaluation of such funding draw attention to the need for a balanced approach that considers both the complexities of global relations and the realities faced by citizens on the ground. The dialogue remains open, with many hoping that the oversight of governmental spending will lead to more prudent fiscal decisions that prioritize the well-being of American families.",-13.0,-16.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,662.0,-0.7619047619047619,-0.02416918429003021

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

In a bold move to combat the influence of fear and propaganda often wielded by terrorist organizations like ISIS, the United States Marines have launched a nationwide initiative emphasizing courage over submission. This campaign coincides with a heightened awareness of recent terrorist attacks within the U.S., reflecting both a response to threats and a commitment to ensuring national security.

Terrorist groups prey on vulnerabilities, using intimidation tactics such as labeling non-believers as infidels and issuing death threats.

The elite fighting force is determined to stand firm against these threats, reinforcing their role as defenders of the nation and its values.

To reinforce their resolve, the Marines have strategically placed billboards across the country, showcasing their readiness to address any terrorist threats. These prominent displays serve as a reminder of the Marine Corps' unwavering commitment to protecting American citizens and confronting those who seek to sow discord and fear. The campaign aims to dismantle the agenda of terror and replace it with a message of bravery.

However, the initiative has not been without controversy. Critics, particularly from liberal circles, have raised concerns about the Marines' stance, questioning the effectiveness and implications of such a campaign. They argue that this militaristic message may further exacerbate tensions rather than promote a unified front against terrorism. These discussions highlight the complexities surrounding the narrative of fear versus courage in the face of adversity.

The overarching message of the campaign is clear: fear is a weapon used by terrorists to instill panic and manipulate populations, and the Marines refuse to yield to it. By publicly demonstrating their readiness to confront threats head-on, they aim to embolden not just themselves, but the broader public as well. This initiative is positioned not only as a show of military strength but also as a call to action for American citizens to remain resolute in the face of intimidation.

As the situation around domestic and international terrorism continues to evolve, such campaigns may play a significant role in shaping public perception and morale. The Marines stand as a powerful emblem of resilience, advocating for a future where courage triumphs over fear, and hope prevails against the forces of terrorism. Through this concerted effort, they aim to inspire a collective spirit that refuses to be cowed by the threats posed by those who seek to undermine freedom and security.",-53.0,-18.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,472.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.038135593220338986

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has been engulfed in chaos as rioting breaks out across the city, resulting in significant damage and widespread looting. The unrest, which authorities describe as violent, has prompted immediate action from state officials in an effort to restore order and safety within the community.

In response to the escalating situation, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency on Wednesday. The declaration allows for the deployment of the National Guard to assist local law enforcement in managing the dangerous environment that has unfolded. This decisive move is part of a broader strategy to address the violence and protect citizens, businesses, and property from further harm.

City officials have made it clear that there will be severe consequences for anyone caught participating in the riots. A proclamation issued by the authorities states that individuals engaged in rioting, looting, or any form of violent behavior will face the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This measure is expected to deter further unlawful activities and ensure that those who disrupt the peace are held accountable.

The repercussions do not solely rest on adults; minors participating in the riots are also facing penalties that could significantly impact their families. Children caught engaging in unlawful activities may similarly jeopardize their parents’ access to government assistance. In a concerning development, parents of these minors could potentially lose state benefits, be referred to social services, or even risk custody of their children if they fail to manage their child’s involvement in such disturbances.

City official Wilson Stewart has stressed the importance of parental responsibility, urging moms and dads to take charge of their children’s actions during this period of unrest. “It is critical for parents to monitor their children's activities closely and ensure they are not participating in these destructive behaviors,” Stewart said. The message is clear: staying vigilant is essential to prevent further escalation of violence in the community.

To aid in restoring peace and security, authorities have implemented a city-wide curfew. This measure is designed to curb the potential for further unrest by limiting movement during the late-night hours. Officials are calling on all residents to comply with this curfew as they work toward reestablishing order in Charlotte.

The combination of unrest, government intervention, and community responsibility outlines a plea for a united front against violence. As the city grapples with the repercussions of these tumultuous events, residents are reminded of their roles in promoting peace and ensuring the safety of all citizens, particularly the youth who are heavily influenced by their environments.

As Charlotte continues to confront the aftermath of the riots, recovery efforts are underway. Local officials emphasize the importance of community solidarity and resilience as they look to heal and rebuild from the damage inflicted during this period of unrest. The focus remains on safeguarding the city’s future and fostering a peaceful environment for all.",-33.0,-20.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,552.0,-0.9090909090909091,-0.036231884057971016

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

The FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal has drawn significant scrutiny and criticism, particularly in the wake of revelations surrounding FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the case. As the controversy surrounding the issue intensifies, calls for Comey to resign have emerged from various quarters, further complicating the political landscape.

A focal point of contention has been Comey’s decision to grant immunity to some of Clinton's top aides, notably Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills. This move has raised eyebrows, especially given her lack of cooperation with the investigation. Mills notably refused to provide her computer for examination, which has led to further complications and criticisms regarding the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation.

As tension mounts, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28, where Comey’s actions and their implications will be examined. The meeting aims to provide a platform for lawmakers to scrutinize the investigation as well as Comey’s decision-making processes. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has emerged as a vocal critic, calling for Comey’s resignation and questioning his overall fitness for office in light of the investigation's execution.

DiGenova has described the FBI's inquiry into the email scandal as inadequate, arguing that it appeared designed to create an illusion of legitimacy while simultaneously offering protection to certain individuals involved, including Mills. This perception of impropriety has fueled criticism from various members of Congress, who are increasingly concerned about Comey's priorities and perceived loyalty to Clinton amidst a high-profile political investigation.

Adding to the controversy, Comey has received a subpoena from Congress, compelling him to produce documents related to the email scandal that have not yet been disclosed. Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas has taken the initiative to ensure that Comey complies, signaling a desire for transparency and accountability within the investigative process.

As the situation develops, questions surrounding Comey's loyalty to Clinton and the potential repercussions he may encounter remain prominent. Lawmakers are intent on understanding the dynamics that influenced Comey’s decisions throughout the investigation, as they believe they may hold vital implications for both the FBI and the ongoing discussion surrounding email security and government accountability.

The upcoming hearing on September 28 is expected to bring forth more intense debates and possible revelations regarding the integrity of the investigation. As calls for Comey’s resignation continue to grow, the consequences of this high-profile investigation are likely to resonate beyond the immediate political landscape, influencing public perception of the FBI and its leadership.

As pressure mounts from both political allies and adversaries, the fate of James Comey and the broader implications of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails have become a central issue that could have lasting ramifications in the world of politics and governance.

This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold… whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?

In recent years, the relationship between Western nations and Saudi Arabia has come under increasing scrutiny. Critics question the ongoing support for a nation whose controversial actions and ties to terrorism cast a long shadow over its geopolitics. Despite widespread reports of human rights abuses, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict with ISIS, the Kingdom continues to receive a troubling amount of endorsement from key global players.

One particularly alarming aspect of this relationship is the financial backing provided by Saudi Arabia to American political campaigns, fueling concerns about ethical governance. Reports indicate that Saudi Arabia financed a considerable 20% of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. This statistic raises critical questions about the integrity of political donations and the implications of accepting funds from a nation correlated with extremist activity and human rights violations. As a prominent player in international politics, Clinton's acceptance of Saudi support embodies a troubling acceptance of questionable practices in exchange for financial backing.

The revelations about the sale of ISIS sex slaves at public auctions in Saudi Arabia further exacerbate these concerns. Eyewitness accounts describe how these auctions attract buyers from diverse nationalities, including Western citizens. The very notion that individuals from nations often seen as advocates for human rights would engage in such heinous activity is both shocking and incomprehensible. This disturbing practice underscores the extent to which the Kingdom may be harboring and indirectly supporting an environment that enables the exploitation of vulnerable populations.

Reports have long noted that ISIS has systematically abused and trafficked sex slaves, specifically targeting Yazidi and Christian women. The atrocities committed by this terror group are well documented, painting a grim picture of their operations. For many of these women, liberation from their captors often comes with a bitter twist: upon being ‘rescued,’ they frequently find themselves re-enslaved, thrust back into the very auctions from which they hoped to escape. This heartbreaking cycle perpetuates the horrors of human trafficking and challenges the very notion of freedom.

As attention grows around these abuses, the complicity of Western nations, particularly Britain, comes into sharper focus. The UK’s continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia raise ethical questions about the consequences of such transactions. Critics argue that supplying weaponry to a nation implicated in supporting terrorism and committing human rights violations only exacerbates the situation. Each weapon sold can potentially facilitate further abuses, putting countless lives at risk and undermining the moral authority of those nations involved.

The grievances extend beyond political donations and arms deals; they reveal a troubling pattern of complicity that permits and, in some cases, encourages the continuation of these inhumane practices. Political leaders who forge alliances with Saudi Arabia fail to consider the broader implications of their actions, appearing to prioritize political expediency over moral accountability.

What is needed now is greater awareness and action from both citizens and political leaders alike. The time has come for a robust examination of the relationship between the West and Saudi Arabia, coupled with meaningful dialogues about human rights and ethical governance. Political leaders must take a stand, reassess their ties, and consider the impact of their policies on individuals facing unimaginable circumstances.

In closing, the complex relationship with Saudi Arabia raises critical questions that demand urgent attention. When financial contributions from such a controversial source influence political decisions, and when the exploitation of women continues to flourish under the guise of commerce, it is a moment of reckoning. A thorough evaluation of the implications of these ties is not just necessary but essential for advocating for those who suffer from the consequences of systems and alliances steeped in complicity.",-30.0,-34.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,673.0,-1.2142857142857142,-0.05052005943536404
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The debate, intended to illuminate the candidates’ positions, quickly became a focal point for criticisms directed at Holt, who was noted for frequently interrupting Trump in an effort to ""fact-check"" him, often in a manner that many deemed inaccurate.

One of the most contentious moments of the night occurred when Holt asserted that Trump had supported the Iraq War. Trump vehemently denied the claim, asserting that he had never supported the invasion. In a surprising turn, Holt did not extend the same scrutiny to Clinton despite her history; she voted in favor of the war in 2002. Instead, the moderator maintained his focus on Trump, which echoed the sentiments of critics who argued that the debate was biased, leaning towards discrediting Trump rather than addressing significant policy discussions.

As the debate concluded, Trump's reflections on the Iraq War were further revealed in a post-debate interview with Neil Cavuto. During this segment, Trump expressed his reservations regarding the decision to invade Iraq, suggesting that it might have been more prudent to wait for a consensus with the United Nations before taking such drastic military action. This admission highlights a nuanced position that contrasts with the more assertive rhetoric heard on stage during the debate.

Critics have pointed out that the overall format of the debate seemed to prioritize personal attacks and character issues over substantive discussions of policy, leading to claims that the event was skewed against Trump. In the midst of this atmosphere, Trump took a firm stand, defending himself against both Clinton's attacks and the critical lens of the media. His assertiveness during the debate resonated with his supporters, who viewed his combative approach as a necessary rebuttal to what they perceived as unfair treatment.

The implications of this debate extend beyond the immediate discussion, as many analysts will scrutinize how both candidates’ performances resonate with voters as the campaign continues. The stark contrast between the two candidates’ styles, particularly in how they handled scrutiny and criticism, sets the stage for a long and contentious election season ahead. With ensuing debates on the horizon, the dynamics established in this initial encounter may very well influence the direction of each campaign as they strive for voter approval.",-9.0,-12.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,439.0,-0.8,-0.02733485193621868
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

In a renewed examination of claims regarding Barack Obama's birthplace, questions are being raised about the integrity of his public image and the implications for his narrative surrounding citizenship. An article from June 2004 published by Breitbart and the Associated Press described Obama, then a candidate for the Illinois Senate seat, as “Kenyan-born.” This statement has resurfaced amid ongoing discussions about the true origins of the former President.

At the time of the 2004 article, Obama was emerging as a strong contender for the Senate after his main rival, Jack Ryan, was forced to withdraw from the race due to a personal scandal. With Ryan’s exit, Obama quickly gained a decisive advantage in the electoral race. However, the reference to him being “Kenyan-born” remained largely unchallenged, causing some to question the credibility of Obama's narrative regarding his birthplace.

The lingering concerns about Obama’s origins are further complicated by a 1991 promotional booklet from his literary agency. This document stated that Obama was “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii,” an assertion that contradicts his publicly stated American birth story. The existence of this promotional material draws attention to potential discrepancies in Obama's claims, raising questions about whether his narrative around birth and citizenship has remained consistent.

While Obama has not directly refuted the “Kenyan-born” claim from the 2004 article, the ongoing accessibility of this information online has fueled skepticism. Critics have begun to insinuate that if Obama's American birth is indeed genuine, then his earlier assertions of being “Kenyan-born” may have been intentionally deceptive, presumably for personal or political gain.

As discussions regarding Obama’s eligibility for the presidency continue to circulate, these alleged contradictions about his birthplace could have significant implications. Questions about the accuracy of his narrative raise broader concerns about transparency among public officials and the standards applied to those seeking the highest office in the nation. 

The debate around Obama’s birthplace serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between identity, politics, and legitimacy. For those seeking to scrutinize this issue further, the original claims made in the 2004 Breitbart article can be accessed, providing context to the ongoing discourse surrounding Obama’s narrative.

In an age where personal history is meticulously examined, the integrity of political figures is paramount. The revelation of conflicting narratives presents a crucial point of discussion as the nation contemplates the standards to which its leaders should be held.",-18.0,3.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,473.0,0.1875,0.006342494714587738

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In the aftermath of the recent debate, tensions have intensified surrounding the performance of Hillary Clinton, as moderators and social media users voice their opinions on the candidate's confidence and potential external aids. Allegations have emerged suggesting that the debate moderator displayed a bias favoring Clinton, further igniting discourse among viewers and critics alike.

During the debate, Clinton exhibited a notable level of confidence, appearing composed and articulate without signs of distress. Unlike previous public engagements, she did not experience any coughing fits or require water, leading some to speculate about the candidate's preparation and potential external aids utilized during her presentation. 

Social media erupted with commentary regarding a controversial flesh-colored device that appeared to be situated in Clinton's ear. Observers have been quick to debate whether this object is an earpiece used for receiving cues or merely a harmless fashion accessory. However, Clinton's campaign has firmly denied any allegations concerning the use of an earpiece, asserting that the sighting was merely a result of lighting reflections during the televised event.

Adding fuel to the fire, social media users unearthed a past email from Clinton to her close aide, Huma Abedin, inquiring about the potential use of an earpiece. This correspondence raised eyebrows and sparked speculation, as critics posited that it illustrated a premeditated awareness of the implications such an item might carry. Many commentators have taken to platforms like Twitter to suggest that Clinton cannot articulate her points without some form of external assistance, a claim which detractors utilize to question her transparency and abilities.

Despite the flurry of accusations and conjectures, a definitive conclusion regarding the controversial device remains elusive. Observers note that the object could easily be a hearing aid, a reflection of light, or simply misidentified by viewers keen to draw connections to the unproven claims. In fact, there have been previous instances where Clinton has struggled under pressure without any indication of an earpiece, leading some to argue that the current narrative may be overblown.

As discussions continue to circulate about the implications of the alleged bias and potential props used during the debate, veteran political analysts suggest that the focus should shift back to Clinton's points and policies rather than the peripherals of her performance. Nevertheless, the insistence on examining every detail of the debate is symptomatic of the charged atmosphere surrounding the election season.

The fervent responses from both supporters and critics illustrate just how polarizing Clinton remains in the American political landscape. As the campaign trail heats up, the debates ahead are poised to capture the public's attention—a stage where every word, action, and even accessory can ignite discussion and reshape perceptions.

As the election looms, the outcome of Clinton's debate performances, both past and future, will undoubtedly play a crucial role in her bid for supremacy in the political arena. Whether the controversy over her debate performance lingers or diminishes remains to be seen. However, what is clear is that debates, especially in today's social media landscape, can spark wide-ranging discussions that extend far beyond the immediate political discourse.",-5.0,-17.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,583.0,-0.85,-0.029159519725557463
