Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

In a recent media discourse, former President Bill Clinton has made waves with his statements regarding donors to his foundation, suggesting that it is “natural” for those contributors to seek favors. This assertion has sparked discussions linking Clinton's remarks to the ongoing ""pay to play"" allegations—similar claims that have been levied against former President Donald Trump regarding his personal charity operations.

Clinton's comments were brought to light during an interview with NPR, where he sought to clarify the context of his statements. He emphasized that while it is commonplace for foundation donors to request assistance, merely asking for favors does not assure that those requests will lead to any grants or privileges. This important distinction was made as Clinton navigated the potential fallout from headlines that have sensationalized his words, inciting comparisons to Trump’s alleged activities with his charitable foundation.

The debate surrounding Clinton's remarks has been further fueled by leaked emails from his foundation that illustrate a stark contrast in access among donors. These emails have revealed that while some contributors were able to secure meetings with Clinton, others were left with denied requests. Importantly, there has been no substantiated evidence linking these interactions to any form of ""pay to play"" scheme, raising questions about the validity of such allegations against the former president.

This discourse naturally transitions to the scrutiny surrounding Trump's charitable practices. Reports indicate that Trump has not personally donated to any of his charitable endeavors since 2008. Instead, he has been accused of collecting significant charitable funds, which allegedly have been funneled towards his personal benefits—an action that raises serious ethical concerns.

The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, is currently investigating Trump’s charitable foundation for potential improprieties. Allegations against the Trump Foundation include the misuse of charitable donations for personal purchases and misrepresenting financial contributions as Trump's own. These claims point to a pattern that suggests serious mismanagement of charitable funds, contrasting sharply with the operational standards that Clinton’s foundation has publicly upheld.

As discussions about these foundations unfold, a pointed concern has arisen regarding the perceived “double standard” in media coverage. Critics argue that the media has placed disproportionate emphasis on minor issues surrounding Clinton's foundation while glossing over substantial controversies linked to Trump's charitable activities. This perceived imbalance in reporting could come with significant consequences, as it may inadvertently aid Trump’s campaign efforts while hindering Clinton's candidacy.

This coverage disparity has not gone unnoticed and has led some analysts to question how such differences in reporting could influence public perception and the overall election landscape. As Clinton seeks to clarify his remarks, the juxtaposition of his foundation's practices with those of Trump’s leads to broader conversations about accountability and ethics in charitable organizations, especially for figures in high political offices.

With the upcoming electoral cycle intensifying the spotlight on both Clinton and Trump, how these allegations and discussions evolve will likely play a critical role in shaping both candidates' trajectories. While Clinton aims to defend his legacy and the integrity of the Clinton Foundation, Trump continues to grapple with the implications of his own charitable operations, which have come under fire from various angles.

As voters begin to engage with these narratives, the conversation will undoubtedly pivot from individual controversies to a larger examination of the role of philanthropy in politics, and what it means for public trust in charitable institutions. In an era where transparency is paramount, both presidential hopefuls are now under increased scrutiny, with their foundations’ deeds perhaps playing a pivotal role in influencing voter opinion leading up to the next election. 

As these issues develop, it will be vital to keep an eye on how the media narrative shapes the public understanding of these complex situations, ensuring that voters are equipped with clear and balanced perspectives moving forward.",6.0,21.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,721.0,0.875,0.02912621359223301
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

In a developing story that could have far-reaching implications, former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) are facing serious allegations regarding the distribution of substandard HIV/AIDS medication in sub-Saharan Africa. The gated narrative has emerged from a draft congressional report indicating that the initiative may have, in fact, ""watered-down"" drug formulations, thereby risking increased morbidity and mortality among countless patients relying on these life-saving treatments. 

The report, entitled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” has been put forth by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee. It presents a comprehensive examination of the troubling interactions between Clinton’s health initiatives and the Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer Ranbaxy, a central player in providing HIV/AIDS drugs for CHAI.

CHAI has long been viewed as a cornerstone of the Clinton Foundation's multi-faceted response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis. Established to improve access to medications and healthcare services for individuals affected by this devastating epidemic, the initiative has garnered considerable attention and funding over the years. However, the latest revelations raise pressing questions about the quality and safety of the medications distributed through this program.

Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower and former employee of Ranbaxy, has played a pivotal role in bringing attention to the alleged practices within the pharmaceutical industry. Thakur was instrumental in a landmark lawsuit against Ranbaxy for selling adulterated and diluted drugs, which has become a linchpin in the ongoing scandal concerning CHAI’s association with the company. Notably, Ranbaxy faced serious repercussions for its actions, pleading guilty to several criminal counts in 2013 and receiving a hefty $500 million fine from the Department of Justice (DOJ).

The DOJ's findings shed light on the potentially dire health risks posed by Ranbaxy’s diluted pharmaceuticals. Critics and health experts alarmingly assert that the distribution of substandard HIV medications can exacerbate existing health issues and accelerate mortality rates among vulnerable populations. The exposed connection between the Clinton Foundation and Ranbaxy means that the consequences of these allegations could extend far beyond mere financial losses, impacting the lives of countless individuals reliant on effective HIV treatment.

Rep. Blackburn has publicly expressed her concerns regarding the scope of the issue, asking crucial questions concerning how many lives may have been affected by the distribution of these diluted medications. The emotional toll on healthcare workers and patients is palpable, she emphasized, as many have been led to believe that they were receiving legitimate treatments thanks to the initiatives championed by the former President and his foundation.

Additionally, the congressional report brings to light troubling concerns regarding the Clinton Foundation's ties to Indian-American figures connected with Ranbaxy who have been the subject of investigations. As the report continues to gather attention, the implications of such connections further compound the scrutiny facing Clinton’s health initiatives.

The backdrop to this unfolding situation traces back to 2004, when the first signs of irregularities at Ranbaxy began to emerge. Regulatory agencies initiated scrutiny in response to concerns about product quality, culminating in a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006. Despite ongoing investigations and serious allegations surfacing over the years, both CHAI and Bill Clinton have continued to advocate for, and distribute, Ranbaxy products, raising eyebrows about the efficacy of established protocols meant to safeguard patient health.

In 2010, CHAI severed its formal ties to the Clinton Foundation but has maintained a close collaborative relationship since then. This decision, however, has not quashed questions regarding possible compromised quality control—issues exacerbated by a 2000 executive order signed by Clinton that has raised concerns about relaxed standards in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

CHAI's engagement in distributing generic HIV drugs from Ranbaxy and other manufacturers began in earnest in 2003, supported by U.S. governmental initiatives aimed at enhancing global access to treatment. As the program expanded, so did reports of potential financial gains, and the congressional report raises serious concerns about possible corruption and increased donor contributions to the Clinton Foundation that may have ensued from these partnerships.

Amidst these allegations and the political ramifications they entail, it is important to underscore the critical nature of the issue at hand. Lives hang in the balance where health outcomes are at stake, and the ramifications of distributing inadequate medications in regions with high HIV prevalence are far-reaching. The alarming intersection of health care, politics, and profit underscores the necessity for accountability in organizations aimed at benefiting public health.

The call for accountability grows louder, with Blackburn and various health experts stressing that the consequences of substandard medications could not only result in wasted lives but diminish trust in global health initiatives designed to provide aid and support to the most vulnerable communities. As the report continues to draw attention to these potential missteps, the global community watches closely, seeking answers and accountability in a matter that transcends political lines and highlights the moral imperative of effective healthcare provision.

As the situation evolves, passionate advocates for public health echo Blackburn’s sentiments, emphasizing the urgent need for transparency. Those affected by the alleged practices of CHAI and Ranbaxy deserve answers and resolution. The battle against HIV/AIDS remains a pressing global concern, and the discourse surrounding these allegations may end up reshaping the narrative of public health interventions and foundations aimed at combating such critical health crises. 

In light of this report and its damning allegations, the question looms large—how did such a powerful partnership go wrong, and how many lives might have been adversely affected by the decisions made at the intersection of health, politics, and profit? As authorities seek answers, the global discourse surrounding the ethics of healthcare interventions continues to evolve, forcing those involved to reckon with the ramifications of their actions on a world stage. 

The findings and allegations documented in the congressional report serve as a powerful reminder of the critical importance of maintaining rigorous oversight in the distribution of healthcare solutions, particularly in regions where access to quality medicines can mean the difference between life and death. Moving forward, stakeholders must ensure that the unfortunate lapses in the quality and safety of distributed medications are rectified and that the patients who depend on such interventions receive only the best care possible.

As the legislators begin their inquiries and the narrative around these allegations expands, it will be essential to remain vigilant in our scrutiny of health initiatives and the entities associated with them. The tale of the alleged emissions of compromised drugs by Bill Clinton’s health initiative is one that embodies the complexities of public health, requiring a renewed commitment to transparency, accountability, and the ethical provision of healthcare. 

With so much at stake, the inquiry into these allegations will undoubtedly draw the attention of not only political actors but also public health advocates, researchers, and the very patients that these initiatives were designed to support. As the investigation deepens, the hope remains that this will lead to significant reform and reliable safeguards to ensure such disappointments do not happen again in the arena of public health. The lives touched by these initiatives demand nothing less, as the long, winding road of healthcare advocacy continues toward its ultimate goal: the health and wellbeing of communities worldwide.",-6.0,12.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1344.0,0.2926829268292683,0.008928571428571428
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling series of events that has captivated political observers, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton experienced a health scare on September 11, 2023, when she collapsed moments before entering her vehicle after attending a memorial ceremony in New York City. The incident, occurring during a day of reflection and remembrance, has raised significant questions regarding her health and political viability as the 2024 election approaches.

Witnesses reported that Clinton appeared unsteady prior to her fall, prompting immediate concern from onlookers. Following the incident, the candidate was transported away from the ceremony. However, just hours later, Clinton re-emerged at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, leaving many to marvel at her renewed vigor and energetic demeanor.

Notions of a quick recovery were swiftly overshadowed by striking observations regarding her appearance. Sources indicated that she looked visibly lighter and more vibrant than earlier that day. Furthermore, reports noted a notable change in one defining feature: her nose. Described as exhibiting a distinct Roman shape, this alteration markedly differed from Clinton's previously recognized Nordic nose. Such variations sparked rampant speculation about the authenticity of the individual who appeared following the health incident.

Amidst these discussions, some observers suggest a possibility that the person seen post-collapse could be a clone or stand-in for the former First Lady. Notably, this individual appeared years younger and exhibited none of the aging signs typically associated with Clinton. This raises concerns, particularly as the stand-in seemed to lack a defining mole located above Clinton's right lip, a feature that has been consistently visible in public appearances.

As the narrative continues to unfold, speculation has arisen regarding the implications for Clinton's campaign strategy and her upcoming public engagements. Political analysts have begun to question whether this clone—or stand-in—may assume the majority of public appearances as the candidate battles ongoing health issues. Recent concerns have emerged particularly about her capacity to participate effectively in critical upcoming debates against current rival Donald Trump.

Analysts point to specific signs to monitor as the situation progresses. Indicators of Clinton's potential use of a clone could include significant weight loss, an appearance of youth, and a lack of signs typically associated with her health challenges, such as coughing or hoarseness. The political landscape awaits clarity on whether the original Hillary Clinton will play an active role in the campaign or if her clone will manage the public façade entirely.

This scenario prompts further examination of the implications for governance should Clinton be elected. Concerns are mounting that, in such a case, a Clinton Administration could operate under the premise of a figurehead leadership, where the real Clinton remains largely absent from public view while delegating all authority to her cabinet through her stand-in. Such an arrangement would mark an unprecedented moment in U.S. political history, drawing comparisons to past speculation regarding President Barack Obama among conspiracy theorists.

The author expresses a grave skepticism about the authenticity of leadership in a potential Clinton Administration, questioning the integrity of democratic processes if a stand-in were to take the reins in the public eye while the genuine candidate remained obscured. 

As the political narrative develops, the public and analysts alike are left to ponder the depth of this situation. Will Clinton's health issues reshape the landscape of the 2024 elections entirely? And what does this mean for the future of political transparency and accountability in the United States? With monitoring efforts and speculations ongoing, the American electorate may soon confront fundamental questions regarding fidelity, representation, and the implications of substitute leadership in the highest office of the land.

While views expressed reflect the author’s perspective, they underscore a unique intersection of health, politics, and public perception in a time of unprecedented political discourse. As speculation continues, the narrative surrounding Hillary Clinton's possible use of a stand-in, and the implications it harbors, remains one of the most contentious discussions leading into the next election cycle.",8.0,10.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,735.0,0.3448275862068966,0.013605442176870748
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In a campaign marked by provocative remarks and contentious policies, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his stark suggestions surrounding immigration and terrorism. His proposals have raised significant concerns among various communities, prompting debate about the potential consequences of his political strategies.

One of the most alarming suggestions from Trump has been his call for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a measure he connects to the prevention of crime perpetrated by what he terms ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" This characterization of immigrants has sparked outrage, as many view it as an unfounded generalization contributing to the stigmatization of entire communities.

In addition to the wall, Trump has proposed the establishment of a national registry for Muslims, drawing troubling parallels to historical actions taken against Jewish populations during the Holocaust. Such a proposal raises questions about religious discrimination and the potential for systemic oppression, as history has shown the disastrous effects of scapegoating based on religious identity.

Perhaps more disquieting is Trump's suggestion of employing extreme measures, including the removal of families of terrorists as a tactic to counteract terrorism. This approach not only raises ethical concerns but also prompts questions about the fundamental values of justice and accountability. The implication that entire families would bear the consequences of an individual's actions echoes a dark chapter in history where collective punishment was meted out without regard for individual rights.

In his critiques of former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump asserts that their narratives and policies are to blame for the rise of terrorism. He frames himself as the antidote to what he perceives as a failure of leadership, claiming that their approaches have allowed terrorism to flourish, particularly concerning threats from ISIS and radical Islamic groups. By painting a stark picture of danger from immigrant populations, he seeks to rally support for his vision of a more exclusionary immigration policy.

Moreover, Trump has questioned the responsibility of Muslim communities in reporting suspicious activities, suggesting an implication of complicity in terrorist actions. This assertion has drawn significant backlash, as it unfairly places an entire faith community under suspicion and can foster an environment of distrust and division.

The implications of Trump's policies have raised alarm among civil rights advocates and community leaders. There are growing concerns about the potential for widespread rounding up of Muslims and the possibility of mass violence against those perceived as threats. Critics warn that such actions could lead to a normalization of state-sanctioned discrimination and violence, echoing some of the darkest periods in history where such policies resulted in the suffering of countless innocent individuals.

Furthermore, the risks inherent in Trump's past statements and proposals indicate a troubling trajectory towards extreme measures. Some commentators have drawn parallels between his rhetoric and historical precedents that led to concentration camps and civilian casualties during wartime. The fear of sliding into draconian measures looms large over conversations about national security and the approach to immigration.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, voters are urged to reflect on the implications of a potential Trump presidency. The stakes are high, and understanding how these policies could manifest in practice is crucial for making an informed decision in the upcoming election. Historical lessons underscore the importance of vigilance against policies that can lead to division and dehumanization.

An informed electorate is essential to safeguarding the values of freedom, justice, and equality. As the election approaches, it becomes increasingly important for citizens to engage with the implications of the candidates’ positions, particularly when those policies have the potential to affect the lives of millions. 

In essence, the conversation surrounding Trump’s immigration and terrorism policies is not merely about security; it encompasses fundamental questions about who we are as a nation and the principles we hold dear. Voters must weigh the rhetoric and proposed policies against historical context and the potential for real-world consequences. 

As the nation stands at the crossroads of a significant electoral decision, the call for participation in the impending election – a foundational element of democratic governance – must resonate deeply with all citizens. The choice made at the ballot box will reverberate for years to come, shaping not just its policies on immigration and terrorism, but also the very fabric of society. 

Ultimately, the upcoming election serves as a pivotal moment for reflection. It is an opportunity for voters to advocate for a future that upholds the values of inclusivity and justice, resisting the allure of fear-based policies that could undermine the principles upon which the nation was built. Engaging in this discourse, armed with knowledge and awareness, will prove vital for shaping an America that aligns with its ideals rather than straying into perilous territory.",-71.0,-36.0,888.0,-2.2903225806451615,-0.07995495495495496,881.0,-1.125,-0.04086265607264472

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, advocating for One World Government and globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have arisen concerning pay-to-play corruption linked to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, with assertions that contributors to the foundation received preferential political access. Sources indicate that these donors were afforded invitations to significant events, including White House State dinners, escalating concerns about the potential entanglement of philanthropy and political favoritism.

The Clinton campaign has staunchly defended the foundation, emphasizing its claimed charitable contributions and the positive impact of its initiatives. However, critics have characterized the foundation as a ""money-making machine"" designed to benefit the Clintons and their network of associates rather than an altruistic entity.

Reports suggest that while the foundation ostensibly operated as a charity, an alarming portion of its funds was diverted from substantive causes. According to an investigation reported by The Daily Caller, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget in 2014 was allocated to charitable grants. Of the approximately $91.3 million spent by the foundation that year, a mere $5.2 million was dedicated to such grants, raising questions about the efficiency and transparency of its financial practices.

A closer examination of the foundation's expenditures reveals a stark contrast between charitable spending and operational costs. In the same year, the foundation reportedly allocated $34.8 million toward salaries, compensation, and employee benefits. Additionally, ""other expenses"" accounted for $50.4 million, not including further costs attributed to professional fundraising efforts.

Despite a considerable increase of $30 million in income for the foundation in 2014, it paradoxically slashed its charitable spending by 40% compared to the previous year. The foundation's expenditures on salaries and other operating costs also rose by $5 million, prompting skepticism about its priorities and fiscal management.

These revelations collectively cast a shadow over the foundation's operations, suggesting a possible strategy by the Clintons to leverage political influence for financial gain. The implications of these allegations not only raise ethical questions about the conduct of the foundation but also prompt deeper inquiries into the intertwining of philanthropy and political accessibility within the broader context of public trust and accountability.

As public scrutiny intensifies, the ongoing discussion surrounding the Clinton Foundation underscores the urgent need for transparency in charitable organizations and their potential connections to political power.",25.0,13.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,421.0,0.8666666666666667,0.030878859857482184
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

This event marked her first appearance since a concerning incident at the 9-11 memorial in New York City, where she was seen convulsing and required assistance to reach her van.

Initially, Clinton's campaign attributed her episode to the heat. However, further scrutiny revealed that the temperature in NYC at the time was a mild 74 degrees, raising doubts about the explanation. Following the incident, Clinton was escorted to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment, bypassing several hospitals along the way.

As speculation mounted regarding her health and the authenticity of the rally, questions emerged about whether her return was genuinely indicative of a recovery or a carefully staged event. Videos from the rally drew attention due to unusual camera angles, fueling suspicions about the sincerity of the audience present.

In an effort to address these concerns, a follow-up video surfaced that suggested the audience might have been fabricated. In response, a C-Span video was released, which confirmed that the original footage from the rally had not been manipulated. The development continues to elicit mixed reactions and ongoing debates about the circumstances surrounding Clinton’s recent appearances.",4.0,3.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,231.0,0.3,0.012987012987012988
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the film industry prepares for the fictional release of “Weekend at Chelsea's,” its title already draws significant attention, expectedly resonating with those who have followed the colorful and, at times, tumultuous media coverage surrounding Hillary Clinton. The film’s premise invokes the absurdity and intrigue that have characterized Clinton's public life, sparking conversations about the media’s remarkable loyalty to her, even in the face of declining voter trust and escalating concerns about her health.

Critics have called attention to the apparent disparity between the media’s unwavering support for Clinton and the growing skepticism regarding her competence as a leader. Recently, public sentiment has indicated that trust in Clinton is faltering, particularly as questions surrounding her health persist. Allegations of her health issues being misrepresented or downplayed rage on, dismissed as mere “conspiracy theories” by her loyal defenders, yet the impression remains that the narrative is carefully curated to protect her public image.

Those who follow Clinton’s journey are increasingly inclined to speculate about the serious health conditions that have been suggested to afflict her — attributing some of her struggles to potential neurological issues that require ongoing medical attention. This leads to a growing call for transparency from the Clinton campaign regarding her health status. Many believe that a lack of openness on this front exacerbates already negative public perceptions, leaving room for skepticism and unhappiness among critical voters.

Recent controversies, coupled with health crises, have begun to weigh heavily on Clinton, as her poll numbers have taken a notable dip. Political analysts observe that the backlash against her recent comments labeling supporters of Donald Trump as “deplorable” adds layers to the critique against her. What was meant to be a rallying cry for her supporters has morphed into a perception of hypocrisy that hinders her political aspirations.

Complicating these dynamics are Clinton’s long-standing ties to various political establishments. Analysts have questioned her previous actions and the implications for her current claims of racism, creating a complicated image that contrasts sharply with the narrative of progress she continues to champion. This tension only serves to deepen the divide within her support base, as some voters grapple with the genuine compassion they feel for her health challenges while simultaneously critiquing her enduring ambition for political power.

Despite the growing skepticism surrounding her potential candidacy for the presidency, it is important to acknowledge the systems of support that still appear to buoy Clinton's aspirations. These support systems may indeed provide the necessary backing for her campaign, despite the complex nature of her current standing within the electorate. However, even amid this support, the overall sentiment tends to lean toward doubt about her capacity to ultimately secure a victory.

As much as one can hope for her political demise given the circumstances, the desire for her to maintain good health is genuine; this duality encapsulates the mixed feelings towards Clinton's ongoing saga. On one hand, there exists a wish for her to exit the political stage gracefully. On the other, there remains concern for her well-being outside the constraints of a life deeply embedded in the political arena.

The narrative concludes with a pointed reminder of the weight of skepticism that hangs over Clinton’s political career, with some critics openly expressing hopes for her eventual imprisonment as accountability for her perceived misdeeds. The lingering belief in the possibility of such an outcome reflects a significant faction of the electorate that has grown disillusioned with her character and decision-making. 

Ultimately, what the unfolding conversation surrounding “Weekend at Chelsea's” and Hillary Clinton reveals is a complex interplay of loyalty, transparency, and the contentious nature of political ambition. The film may draw laughter and applause, however, its essence speaks to the serious undercurrents that run through the heart of American politics. While anticipating the film's reception may be entertaining, the reality it reflects about public figures like Clinton remains anything but a joke.

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant and reflective final address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack Obama expressed deep skepticism regarding the ability to effectively combat ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. This address, marking a significant moment in his presidency, highlighted the complex and escalating challenges posed by militant organizations that have emerged in recent years.

Obama, who has been at the forefront of discussions surrounding national security and terrorism, did not shy away from acknowledging the limitations of the U.S. military in addressing these threats. With a sense of urgency, he referred to such groups as a “JV team,” indicating his view that they are not to be underestimated, despite the perception that they are not fully equipped to challenge the conventional military might of the United States. This metaphor illustrates the struggle against what many see as an evolving and adaptive enemy.

One of the most crucial points made by Obama during his speech was the recognition of the Islamic State's alarming growth. He candidly stated that there exists no viable military solution to the complexities of the ongoing conflict, thus challenging conventional strategies that rely heavily on direct military engagement. This assertion has sparked considerable debate among military and political experts regarding the effectiveness of a purely military response in addressing deeply rooted sociopolitical issues.

Moreover, Obama stressed the importance of understanding the region's dynamics, arguing that external powers cannot dictate coexistence among diverse religious and ethnic communities. He advocated for a shift in focus—one that emphasizes diplomacy, violence reduction, and the support of political settlements as paths toward achieving long-term stability in areas plagued by conflict and sectarian strife.

However, the president's message has not been without criticism. Some detractors argue that his diplomatic approach may ultimately lead to ineffectiveness, especially given the seemingly unreasonable nature of those involved in the conflicts. The skepticism surrounding his proposals raises questions about the practicality of this approach in a world where radical elements often reject compromise and negotiation in favor of violence.

The article further addresses a perceived disconnect among liberals in recognizing the real threat of radical Islam. Critics lament a reluctance to confront the issue head-on, which they believe could hinder more robust responses to the growing menace of militant groups. This reluctance could be reflective of broader ideological divides regarding the nature of terrorism and the best means of addressing it.

In conclusion, Obama’s final remarks at the U.N. encapsulate a pivotal viewpoint that balances the acknowledgment of military limitations with a call for diplomatic solutions. While advocates of a more forceful response to radical extremism criticize his stance as defeatist, the speech serves as a significant reflection on the complex, intertwining nature of global conflict, diplomacy, and the imperative for cooperation in the face of emerging threats. The conversation sparked by his address is likely to influence U.S. foreign policy and national security discussions for years to come.",-5.0,-17.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,552.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.030797101449275364
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents reveal that the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was foreseen by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as early as 2012. These revelations shed light on the Obama Administration's policy maneuvers, indicating that conditions were deliberately created to facilitate the isolation of the Syrian government led by Bashar al-Assad.

The documents suggest that Western powers, alongside Turkey and Gulf Arab nations, actively supported extremist Takfiri militants in the region, despite awareness that such actions could lead to the formation of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. Investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed voiced concerns that violent Islamist groups were intentionally sponsored as part of a strategy to undermine Assad's regime, despite prior warnings about the potential emergence of ISIS.

This strategic miscalculation by the Obama Administration is further underscored by President Obama's characterization of ISIS as a ""JV"" team—a remark now viewed as emblematic of the larger failure to maintain a U.S. military presence in Iraq. The lack of sustained involvement contributed to a power vacuum that facilitated the rise of the terrorist organization.

The documents also relate to weapons operations in Libya concerning the 2012 Benghazi attack, which exposed knowledge within the administration about weapon shipments from Benghazi to Syria. These revelations have led to heightened scrutiny regarding the circumstances surrounding the tragic events in Benghazi, with a prevailing belief that U.S. servicemen and officials may have been sacrificed due to a covert Middle Eastern policy linked to the burgeoning threat of ISIS.

The emerging information raises significant concerns about the prioritization of political objectives over national security, suggesting that concealing the facts may have taken precedence over the safety of military personnel and broader geopolitical stability. As evidence mounts, the narrative surrounding U.S. involvement and the international landscape during this period is being re-evaluated, calling for accountability and a critical examination of past policies.",-27.0,-15.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,365.0,-1.3636363636363635,-0.0410958904109589
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a dramatic turn of events on September 11, Hillary Clinton was seen collapsing before entering her van after attending a commemorative ceremony in New York City. This incident instantly sparked concern among onlookers, leading to widespread speculation regarding her health.

Just hours later, Clinton made an appearance at her daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment. Contrary to her earlier collapse, she appeared energetic and vibrant, raising eyebrows and skepticism about the authenticity of her health status. Observers pointed out several significant changes in Clinton’s appearance that further fueled speculation.

In particular, many noted a noticeable weight loss, which has been a point of interest for both supporters and critics alike. Additionally, there were stark differences in the shape of Clinton’s nose observed during her appearance at the apartment, diverging from her known Nordic nose to a shape more reminiscent of a Roman style. Such observations have led some to draw rather peculiar conclusions about the individual seen in the apartment: some suggest that it might not be the same Hillary Clinton the public has come to know.

Further enhancing the air of speculation, commentators noted that the individual appearing in Chelsea's residence appeared younger than the former Secretary of State. There was also the striking observation that this individual lacked a notable mole above the lip— a feature that has been a characteristic mark for Hillary. With an emphasis on these differences, questions inevitably emerge about who was truly present at the moment of recovery.

As the discussions unfold, speculation intensifies around the authenticity of Hillary Clinton's public engagements, specifically her capacity to participate in upcoming debates and events. An unsettling narrative is beginning to take shape as concerns are raised over whether the real Hillary Clinton will ever be seen in the capacity expected of a presidential candidate. Some have hypothesized that her responsibilities could be delegated to a double or even a clone, raising alarming questions about transparency in leadership.

The implications of such a scenario extend beyond mere speculation; they touch upon the fundamental authenticity of an administration. With questions swirling regarding Clinton's ability to be present for essential duties, many are left pondering the repercussions if the real Hillary Clinton remains absent from public life and decision-making responsibilities. Would we be witnessing a genuine form of leadership, or merely a facade crafted for public consumption? 

Interestingly, parallels have begun to arise between Clinton's potential situation and that of former President Barack Obama. Some speculate that there may be hidden realities in leadership that the public is unaware of, suggesting that the dynamics of political representation could be vastly different from the narratives commonly presented.

The ongoing debate around Clinton’s health and public presence is indicative of broader concerns regarding authenticity in political figures. As the country inches closer to the debates, the nature of who truly represents Clinton is becoming a matter of public interest and concern. The implications of such questions extend beyond the realm of personal health, posing deeper inquiries about the integrity and transparency of political representation as a whole.

As this narrative develops, it is essential to consider the broader meanings behind the events. Can the American public trust the democratic system if key figures are potentially not what they seem? And if the suspicions surrounding Clinton's health persist, how will this impact her campaign moving forward?

In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton’s health and the mystery of her public appearances is sure to remain a topic of heated discussion. Whether the real Hillary Clinton will make herself known again is an unanswered question that looms large as the election cycle progresses.

Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate, is facing growing scrutiny over her health amid rumors of a possible nervous breakdown. Recent speculation intensified after a video was released, showing Clinton appearing to lose control of her eyes during an event. This alarming moment has raised questions about her mental well-being, particularly as she abruptly canceled a fundraiser in North Carolina that was scheduled for the same day.

The current campaign landscape reveals stark differences between Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump. Between September 20 and October 19, Clinton has only one rally planned, while Trump has announced four. This discrepancy has fueled concerns among supporters and party insiders about Clinton's ability to sustain a vigorous campaign.

Recent reports have highlighted further issues, including an incident where Clinton required Secret Service assistance to navigate two steps at a rally. Such observations have led to increasing worries about her physical health, igniting discussions within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) regarding the potential need for alternative candidates. Sources suggest that the DNC is exploring options, given the uncertainty surrounding Clinton's candidacy and her perceived vulnerabilities.

Despite concerns about her health, the remaining Democratic figures, including prominent candidate Bernie Sanders, appear reluctant to step into the presidential role. The political narrative forces Clinton into the spotlight as the party's most viable candidate, even amid apprehensions about her capability to effectively compete.

The situation raises significant questions regarding transparency and potential cover-ups related to Clinton's health. Observers are on high alert, as any indication of a serious health issue could undermine the Democratic party's public image, particularly in a pivotal electoral season. The implications of these rumors could stretch beyond individual candidacy, impacting party dynamics and voter confidence.

As the situation unfolds, the political landscape will undoubtedly be influenced by any new developments regarding Clinton's health. With the election drawing closer, the Democratic party finds itself at a crossroads, weighing the potential for change against the reality of a candidate facing significant scrutiny. Political analysts are closely monitoring the situation, anticipating further revelations that could shape the future of Clinton’s campaign and the party’s prospects in the upcoming election.",-8.0,8.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,426.0,0.47058823529411764,0.018779342723004695
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the heart of the White House, a restless Barack Obama found himself wandering the West Wing on one of those long, insomniac nights of his presidency. The clock ticked past midnight, and the typically bustling halls were devoid of the usual political clamor. Caught in a flurry of thoughts, Obama struggled with an idea—a spark of inspiration that would soon take shape. 

As he wandered the dimly lit corridors, the weight of the world resting on his shoulders, Obama sought distractions in the quiet solitude of the presidential residence. A quick snack here, a glance at the carefully curated art pieces there—all were futile attempts to find peace of mind. But as he moved through the different offices, something began to crystallize in his mind, ultimately leading him to a simple realization. He grabbed a Post-It note and, in a moment of clarity, jotted down the letters ""ISIS,"" a name that would begin to represent an audacious concept he had only just started to develop.

It wasn't until months later, however, that the concept began to solidify. The scene shifted dramatically when Obama found himself at Coachella, a sprawling music festival notorious for its vibrant atmosphere and sometimes mind-altering experiences. Immersed in the energy of electronic music, he let loose, embracing the spirit of the festival and partaking in a bit of ecstasy. The euphoric environment ignited a sense of clarity that propelled his earlier musings into a more cohesive vision: the creation of an international terrorist organization. 

In his mind, this was unprecedented territory. Obama would become the first American president to lay the groundwork for such a scheme. Yet, he understood fully that the enormity of his revelation would likely be met with skepticism. Staring down the enormity of his ambition, he felt compelled to share his secret aspirations with someone he trusted: Hillary Clinton.

This monumental conversation occurred during an unexpected rendezvous in the White House kitchen—a place often buzzing with activity but now quiet and intimate. As they both indulged in a few colorful Popsicles, Obama gathered the courage to broach the topic. He revealed not just ambitious aspirations, but also deeply personal truths about his heritage and the motivations behind his intentions. For a moment, time seemed to stand still, the only sounds being the fading echoes of their idle chatter and the drips of melting Popsicles.

Hillary’s reaction was one of shock. This was not an ordinary conversation about policy or administration; it was a bold proclamation that challenged the very core of political dialogue. As she processed this information, they delved into the implications of the plans for this newly minted organization, which held the potential to unsettle the very fabric of society as they knew it.

The gravity of their discussion led them from the kitchen and into the serene setting of the Rose Garden. There, surrounded by blooming flora and the gentle rustle of leaves, they continued their dialogue. Snacks and drinks were shared, providing both comfort and a sense of camaraderie. In the peaceful garden, their amusement mixed with contemplation as they explored the possibilities that lay ahead.

Amidst laughter and lighthearted banter, Hillary suggested a strategic delay for executing their plans for ISIS. “What if we wait until I become president?” she proposed with a mischievous smile, envisioning a time when their schemes could be executed with far-reaching authority. A shared vision of secrecy and power mingled in the warmth of the afternoon sun.

Obama felt a profound connection during this moment. This was no longer just a casual chat; it had evolved into a plan that could shake the world—together, envisioning a radical transformation of their political landscape. The prospect of embarking on such an unprecedented journey filled him with understanding, excitement, and the thrill of conspiracy.

As the shadows grew longer and the sunlight began to wane, the duo pondered the implications of their newfound ideology. For Obama and Hillary, this was not just about the creation of an organization; it was an exploration of identity, power, and the very essence of leadership in their time. Hidden in the quiet corners of the White House, a secret alliance began to take shape—one that would challenge the very definitions of their legacies.

The implications of their discussions echoed in the silence, leaving them both exhilarated and contemplative. As the sun dipped below the horizon, they found themselves caught in a whirlwind of aspirations, dreams, and the exhilarating possibilities of the future. What started as an innocuous night of restless reflection morphed into a daring vision that would intertwine their fates irrevocably.

Though the world outside continued its relentless pace, inside the White House, an extraordinary partnership was being forged. A story that began with a restless night and ended in a garden blossomed into a contemplative understanding of their respective roles, not just as public figures, but as architects of an audacious plan. Behind closed doors, the future began to take shape in ways few could ever imagine.",-4.0,47.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,956.0,1.146341463414634,0.049163179916317995
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the heated arena of American politics, few phrases resonate more than a campaign promise. Former President George H.W. Bush's declaration, ""read my lips…no new taxes,"" stands out as a commitment that ultimately haunted his presidency. As candidates vie for public support, similar ambitious promises often emerge, laden with implications that can ripple through society well beyond election day. The recent statements made by Donald Trump in the wake of terrorist attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota highlight this point effectively.

In a pressing response to the tragic events, Trump declared his intention to ""destroy"" terrorism in the United States. While such a bold assertion may strike chords of nationalism and strength among his supporters, the ramifications of such proclamatory intent beg careful scrutiny. Trump's remarks were not merely a call to arms against violent extremism; they were accompanied by pointed criticisms targeting President Obama and Secretary Clinton, suggesting a blame-shifting strategy that is all too common in modern political discourse.

However, a campaign built on fiery rhetoric poses significant ethical and humanitarian concerns. Critics have raised alarms over what Trump's promise could mean for Muslim Americans and communities across the nation. If history serves as a guide, the language of destruction can swiftly shift into the realm of profiling and discrimination. In a hypothetical scenario where Trump fulfills his commitments, one could foresee a troubling landscape where American citizens, including those adhering to the Islamic faith, experience heightened scrutiny and could even face extreme measures amounting to a loss of constitutional rights.

Imagining a nation stricken by fear and simmering tensions paints a disconcerting picture reminiscent of darker chapters in history. The possibility of systemic profiling under a Trump regime evokes comparisons to historical fascism, where groups of individuals were marginalized, oppressed, and dehumanized under the guise of national security. The need for vigilance in political rhetoric is paramount; it bears the potential to dictate the moral compass of a nation at perilous crossroads.

When assessing the viability of Trump's promise to obliterate terrorism, one must grapple with a fundamental truth: terrorism cannot simply be eradicated through passionate declarations or aggressive postures. It is a complex issue rooted in a myriad of sociopolitical, cultural, and economic factors. The notion that a singular approach, infused with bravado and vilification of opponents, can resolve such a multifaceted problem is dangerously simplistic. History teaches us that the eradication of hatred and violence requires a comprehensive strategy grounded in understanding, coalition-building, and respect for human rights.

Moreover, Trump's infringing on civil liberties in the pursuit of security is not only a concern for those who might be directly targeted; it sends a worrisome message about the kind of nation America aspires to be. The consequences of such fear-mongering tactics can polarize society further, breaking down the social fabric that binds communities together and jeopardizing the rights of all citizens under the Constitution.

Ultimately, voters must weigh the weightiness of campaign promises like Trump's against the harsh realities of governance. While tapping into fears and anxieties may invigorate a candidate's base, it is vital for responsible citizenship to demand that leaders move beyond mere rhetoric. A campaign rooted in fear rather than hope threatens to unravel the principles of equity and justice that the United States espouses.

As the political landscape evolves ahead of the elections, evaluating the implications of candidates' proclamations will become increasingly critical. The stark choice will lie not just in which candidate garners the most fervent support but in which vision aligns with the founding values of a nation that prides itself on liberty, equality, and justice for all. To heed the lessons of the past, both politicians and voters alike must navigate the treacherous waters of rhetoric with an unwavering commitment to protect and uphold the rights that define democracy. The journey to find transformative solutions to pressing issues like terrorism must prioritize liberty over fear, dialogue over division, and unity over hatred.",-28.0,-4.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,750.0,-0.14285714285714285,-0.005333333333333333

Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

At a recent gathering of military leaders at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno expressed urgent concerns regarding the current state of national security. He warned that the United States is approaching a dangerous tipping point characterized by escalating terrorism threats and hostilities from adversaries such as the Soviet Union and North Korea.

While addressing the symposium, Gen. Odierno emphasized that the Army's current readiness is merely sufficient for immediate needs, raising alarms about the long-term implications for national defense. He highlighted that any further reductions in military capabilities could yield severe consequences for national security, a sentiment that resonates given the evolving global landscape.

The General underscored a troubling disconnect between the current administration and military leadership, a rift that began during the Obama Administration and contributed to the rise of ISIS. He criticized the administration for neglecting the strategies and advice of military commanders, stating that this oversight is detrimental not only to military operations but also to the safety of the nation.

Odierno further painted a stark picture of the global security environment, insisting that the U.S. is confronted with determined enemies capable of posing significant threats to both the United States and its allies. The issues are compounded by substantial reductions in Army personnel, which have included the downsizing of the force by 80,000 soldiers and the elimination of 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades.

The General also called attention to the declining investment in military modernization, noting a 25% decrease that is negatively impacting crucial programs, including infantry fighting vehicles and scout helicopters.

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

Cruz argues that this move could pose a serious threat to freedom of speech, citing concerns that nations such as Russia, China, and Iran could impose censorship on online content, potentially impacting American users as well.

Cruz points out that many individuals in the United States remain unaware of the implications of this significant shift in control. He warns that the transfer, scheduled to take place on September 30, 2016, could undermine the principles of open access and expression that the Internet embodies.

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the United States approaches critical elections, the discourse surrounding voting integrity continues to escalate. Each state has established its own legal framework governing election methods and procedures, reflecting the unique political landscapes across the nation. However, concerns are mounting, particularly among Christian and Constitutional Conservative circles, about the perceived intentions of the National Democratic Party.

Described by some as a ""powerful hate group,"" the Democratic Party is accused of employing various tactics to distort the electoral process. Critics argue that their objective goes beyond mere political maneuvering; they assert that the Democratic Party is attempting to orchestrate an insidious power grab aimed at establishing a socialist dictatorship in the United States.

Among the most serious allegations are claims of voter fraud and ballot stuffing, particularly surrounding the contentious 2016 presidential election. Opponents of the Democratic Party pointed to supposed efforts to support ""Hillary the Horrible,"" suggesting that such actions were not isolated incidents but part of a larger strategy to manipulate election outcomes.

At the heart of this debate lies a clarion call for accountability and transparency in the voting process. Advocates emphasize the importance of encouraging all eligible citizens to participate in elections, yet they vehemently condemn what they view as the Democratic Party's deliberate attempts to rig the system. This sentiment resonates especially among those who champion voter ID laws, which are seen as essential measures to ensure that only eligible individuals cast their votes.

Critics assert that the Democratic Party's opposition to voter ID legislation stems from a desire to permit ineligible voters to manipulate Democratic outcomes, thus undermining the integrity of the electoral process. This opposition raises serious questions about the motivations behind preventing these safeguards and contributes to a growing sense of urgency among proponents of election integrity.

The frustrations extend beyond state-level issues and into the realm of federal governance, where the Obama administration, Congress, and federal courts have faced scrutiny for their handling of election laws. Critics argue that these entities have suppressed initiatives aimed at ensuring fair elections, further complicating an already contentious landscape.

In response to these pressing concerns, there is a resounding call for civic engagement. Citizens are urged to volunteer and monitor polling places actively, playing a direct role in safeguarding the democratic process against potential voter fraud. This grassroots involvement is presented as a necessary bulwark against what many believe to be a coordinated effort by the Democratic Party to manipulate election outcomes.

Supporters of Donald Trump, in particular, view his candidacy as a pivotal moment in the nation's history. They assert that Trump embodies a patriotic stance aimed at reclaiming the country from what they perceive as a looming tyranny. For many, the November 8, 2016 election represents more than just a vote; it is framed as a critical juncture for the republic—a moment when the values of Constitutional Conservatism can be set against the perceived encroachments of more radical political ideologies.

The urgency articulated by these advocates is palpable, urging citizens who hold dear the principles of the Constitution to take proactive measures in monitoring electoral conduct. They emphasize the necessity of vigilance to prevent corruption they believe is being perpetuated by the Democratic Party and its supporters.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that the views expressed in this discourse represent the beliefs of the author and do not necessarily reflect a consensus within broader political or media circles. As the country navigates the complexities of its democratic engagement, the conversations surrounding election integrity, the role of voter ID laws, and the motivations behind various political actions remain highly polarized.

In summary, as the electoral landscape becomes increasingly fraught with allegations and concerns, the call to action for Constitutional Conservatives rings loud and clear: safeguard the integrity of the electoral process, ensure fair governance, and protect the republic from perceived encroachments on liberty. The upcoming elections are viewed not only as a civic duty but as a battleground for preserving foundational American values in a time of uncertainty.",-52.0,-5.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,746.0,-0.19230769230769232,-0.006702412868632708
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the annals of American political marketing, few advertisements have left quite the impact as the 1964 campaign spot featuring a young girl picking daisies beneath a looming nuclear mushroom cloud. This powerful imagery was crafted to provoke fear, securing a pivotal moment in the presidential race for President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson's intent was clear: to discredit his opponent, Barry Goldwater, framed as a reckless figure who posed a danger to the nation's future and safety. Ironically, the advertisement emerged against the backdrop of Johnson's own controversial decisions regarding the Vietnam War, a complicating reality that has echoed throughout subsequent political campaigns.

The potential revival of this iconic advertisement takes on contemporary significance as Democrats gear up for the electoral contest. Some analysts speculate about a modern version that could effectively expose failures associated with Hillary Clinton’s political career, potentially undermining her presidential aspirations. This provocative idea suggests a strategic move within Clinton's campaign to reinforce her image while simultaneously displacing the narrative of her shortcomings onto her opponent. In this culture of fear-laden political advertising, does Clinton risk repeating the mistakes of previous candidates?

Amid glimpses of innovation, the rumor mill is already churning with whispers of a new ""Daisy"" ad directed at Donald Trump. This speculation hints at a level of desperation among Clinton's campaign staff, gripping onto the age-old tactic of fear to sway voters. The use of emotionally charged imagery to incite anxiety is a hallmark of many campaign strategies, demonstrating an ongoing reliance on this powerful form of media manipulation.

As the political landscape shifts rapidly, voters face the daunting challenge of navigating through a labyrinth of media narratives. The evolving portrayal of Republican candidates, such as Ted Cruz, serves to illustrate this complexity. Following a notable political shift, some media outlets took it upon themselves to lambaste Cruz, showcasing a growing trend where journalistic commentary often targets Democrats while neglecting significant factual nuances concerning their Republican counterparts.

This bias in reporting is not new; accusations of a ""liberal press"" have stormed through decades of political discourse. The weight of historical bias raises pressing questions about journalistic integrity and equity, necessitating a call for more balanced coverage across the political spectrum. As the nation approaches critical debates, memories of past biases loom large. Moderators’ past comments may cast a long shadow over the credibility of the debates, impacting how information is delivered and perceived by the public.

Adding further intrigue to Clinton's narrative are the remarks made by former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Both have previously commented on issues surrounding Hillary’s trustworthiness and qualifications for the presidency. Their perspectives could be both boon and burden; while they frame her as an experienced politician, they also draw attention to lingering concerns that have plagued her campaign.

As political advertisement sails forward, the suggestion that a modern ""Daisy"" ad could evoke a similarly impactful critique of Clinton's candidacy raises necessary discussions about media strategy, storytelling, and the role of fear in American politics. Such an ad could cleverly scheme to illustrate Clinton's perceived shortcomings by echoing the emotional resonance of its 1964 predecessor. Regardless of intent, the phrase ""Daisy, Daisy"" is not merely a call out to past electoral battles, but a reminder of how easily narratives can be crafted—without caveat or context.

The legacy of the original ""Daisy"" ad lingers, serving as a double-edged sword in political strategy. While fear-mongering tactics have historically proven effective in wooing voters, they have often walked a fine line between truth and manipulation. The complexity of presenting an opponent’s faults without accurate framing raises ethical questions in strategic communication.

Through the lens of the current political climate, it becomes increasingly important to recognize how historical narratives shape voter perceptions. In the quest for victory, clarity often suffers amidst sensationalized portrayals, leaving citizens grappling for authentic truth from their candidate's accolades and deficiencies. Those crafting narratives are urged to consider the weight of their responsibility: with the push and pull of commentary, the challenge remains to uphold an informed electorate.

The upcoming debates will serve as a vital platform wherein these nuanced narratives will collide. As candidates vie for public favor, the question looms—will the media facilitate an honest conversation about their stances, or will it adhere to the familiar patterns of bias that have pervaded past coverage? Voter engagement hinges on the pressing need for forthright journalism, which will not only contextualize candidates’ positions but will also eschew sensationalism in favor of substance.

As the spotlight intensifies on candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, it becomes crucial to critically analyze how the echoes of past advertising strategies and the media's tendency toward bias shape contemporary political discourse. In this ever-evolving landscape, the stakes resemble an intricate chess game where perception heavily influences reality—a dancer delicately balancing between fear and reason.

As we stand on the precipice of this dynamic political era, it is clear that the legacy of the ""Daisy"" ad continues to resonate. The ball is now in the court of today's media and the strategies they employ; how they navigate the waters, devoid of manipulation and full of truth, will determine not only the outcomes of elections but potentially, the future of American democracy.",-18.0,-26.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,1005.0,-0.7027027027027027,-0.025870646766169153

Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there.

In an ongoing debate surrounding President Obama's birth certificate, claims of racism have emerged from Democratic circles as a response to questions raised about its authenticity. Lynn Sweet, a Washington Bureau Chief, argues that skepticism regarding the birth certificate serves as an indicator of underlying racism. However, many critics contend that such assertions represent a non-sequitur, diverting attention from substantive issues.

Concerns about the legitimacy of the birth certificate have been fueled by various allegations suggesting possible alterations. Questions have arisen regarding the specifics of Obama's social security number, which was issued in Connecticut—despite no supporting residency records. Furthermore, the hospital cited on the birth certificate reportedly did not exist at the time it was supposedly issued, and the document itself is deemed to contain inaccuracies that may point to potential falsification.

The author expresses an ongoing concern about the absence of an original birth certificate being made publicly available. Instead, the discourse has relied heavily on accusations of “birther” conspiracies and allegations of racism, overshadowing the need for concrete evidence. In light of this, disappointment in Donald Trump's reluctance to address the matter with clarity has been noted.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- In May 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual man, was attacked in Eastbourne, resulting in a broken jaw.

In May 2016, the seaside town of Eastbourne became the site of a violent hate crime when Aaron Woods, a homosexual man, was brutally attacked. The incident, which left Woods with a broken jaw, has raised alarm within local communities and highlighted ongoing issues regarding homophobia.

Eyewitness accounts and statements from friends reveal the brutal nature of the assault. Brian Markintosh, a close friend of Woods, described him as a gentle person who fell victim to an unprovoked attack. The assailant reportedly used homophobic language and made references to ""Muslim stuff"" during the incident, sparking discussions about the conflicts between different cultural values and beliefs.

This incident was not isolated; a similar attack occurred in Brighton around the same time. In this case, a gay couple was assaulted by two men, further underscoring the troubling trend of violence against the LGBTQ+ community in the region. 

In response to these assaults, Sussex police acted swiftly, making arrests shortly after the incidents occurred. Sgt. Peter Allan expressed sadness over the violence but noted that the prompt police response and community involvement helped ensure that victims were on the path to recovery. 

The attacks have fueled a broader dialogue about the disparities between the values of the gay community and certain interpretations of Islamic teachings. Specifically, Shariah law's condemnation of homosexuality stands in stark contrast to the acceptance and rights advocated by LGBTQ+ activists. While many American Muslims have shown a greater level of acceptance, there remains a faction of radical Islam that continues to oppose the existence and rights of the gay community.

These violent incidents have thus spotlighted the relationships between diverse communities and highlighted the need for continued dialogue and understanding. The troubling rise in homophobic assaults serves as a reminder of the work still needed to foster greater acceptance and safety for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. As communities grapple with these ongoing challenges, the call for inclusivity and protection against hate crimes remains urgent and necessary.",-26.0,-46.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,378.0,-2.875,-0.12169312169312169
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

St. Cloud, Minnesota—A horrifying attack unfolded at a local mall on Saturday evening when a man dressed in a security uniform began assaulting shoppers, leaving nine individuals injured. Witnesses report that the assailant, later identified as Dahir Adan, shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" during the violent rampage. This incident has sparked widespread concern and unease within the community and beyond.

Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, has been recognized by the St. Cloud Somali-American community as the attacker. The situation escalated quickly when Adan reportedly questioned at least one victim about their religion before launching his assaults. This has raised issues of targeted violence and religious profiling among community members and law enforcement.

In the wake of the attack, ISIS claimed responsibility, declaring Adan as a member of their organization. This revelation has drawn attention to the concerning trend of violent incidents involving individuals linked to terrorist groups, particularly those from the Somali immigrant community in the United States. The St. Cloud attack coincided with other violent events across the country, including a bombing incident in New Jersey and an assault on police officers in New York, further intensifying fears of escalating violence.

The St. Cloud Somali-American community has come forward to express their support for Adan’s family, emphasizing that he was considered a good man and an accomplished student. Many community members were blindsided by the severity of his actions, expressing disbelief that someone they knew could commit such an atrocity.

Fortunately, the situation came to a swift conclusion when Officer Jason Falconer, who was off-duty at the time, intervened and fatally shot Adan, preventing further harm to innocent civilians. Falconer’s actions have been hailed by many as heroic, albeit they come amid a backdrop of growing tension between local law enforcement and immigrant communities.

The incident has reignited a long-standing discourse regarding the resettlement of Somali refugees in Minnesota. The state has historically been a destination for immigrants seeking refuge, particularly from the turmoil ravaging Somalia. However, recent events have raised alarming questions about the potential for radicalization within these communities. Concerns have been voiced regarding the targeted recruitment of Somali youth by terrorist organizations like ISIS and al-Shabaab, posing a dual challenge of integration and security.

Additionally, allegations have emerged suggesting that some Somali refugees have made threats towards local women, exacerbating tensions between different demographic groups within the area. With reports of increasing influence of ISIS in Somalia, fears are mounting that these dynamics could lead to further incidents of violence in the U.S.

The troubling trend extends beyond mere rhetoric, as several Somali-Americans have faced convictions related to collaboration with terror groups. These instances underscore an urgent need for dialogue and action concerning how communities are supported and integrated, as well as the impact of foreign conflicts on domestic security.

In light of such incidents and the broader issues of immigration and security, political discourse has intensified. While some advocate for increased refugee assistance and an understanding of immigrant communities, others point towards policies that they believe may foster environments conducive to extremist ideologies. The connection between increased refugee resettlement and incidents of violence has become a contentious topic, particularly in the context of the upcoming elections.

Many critics have directed their ire towards political figures such as Hillary Clinton, arguing that her immigration policies may inadvertently contribute to a rising risk of terrorism in the United States. Proponents of this viewpoint contend that greater scrutiny and restrictions on refugee resettlement could serve to enhance national security and protect American citizens from potential threats.

In response to the St. Cloud attack and similar incidents, there are renewed calls for a reevaluation of current policies regarding immigration and refugee acceptance. Some believe that taking a hard stance against further influxes of refugees from regions grappling with extremism is crucial for maintaining safety and order in American communities.

As we reflect on the violence that took place in St. Cloud, it is essential to recognize the broader implications for national safety. The attack raises urgent questions about community cohesion, the integration of immigrants, and the threats posed by radical elements that may exploit vulnerable populations. 

In light of these concerns, voters are urged to consider their choices carefully in the upcoming elections. The discourse surrounding immigration reform and national security will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping America's future, especially in light of the tragic events that unfolded in St. Cloud. The decision to vote against candidates whose policies are perceived to endanger national safety is being framed as an essential step toward preventing future attacks and ensuring a secure environment for all citizens.

The St. Cloud mall attack serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges ahead as America grapples with the complexities of immigration, community relations, and security. Only through decisive political action and community engagement can we hope to navigate these turbulent waters and build a safer future for all.",-72.0,-49.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,920.0,-1.1136363636363635,-0.05326086956521739
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent discussions about societal standards and the nature of victimhood, the term “everyone gets a trophy generation” has surged in popularity, particularly when referencing millennials. This label reflects a perceived low standard for personal responsibility and a growing inclination toward victim mentality—a notion exemplified by several high-profile cases. One notable example is Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect linked to bombings in New Jersey and New York City.

Rahami, who stands accused of multiple bombings, previously adopted a narrative of victimhood when he claimed discrimination based on ""Islamophobia."" His actions prompted scrutiny, particularly regarding his family's interactions with local law enforcement. In 2011, Rahami and his father filed a lawsuit against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police, alleging discrimination rooted in their Muslim identity. This legal action highlighted the family's grievances, claiming that police targeted them due to their religious beliefs and sought to undermine their business, a fried chicken restaurant named First American.

The suit accused police of harassing Rahami's family through baseless tickets while ostensibly trying to shut down their restaurant. Local allegations of racial abuse emerged, with neighbors reportedly asserting that “Muslims don’t belong here.” Such examples illustrate the deeply entrenched issues surrounding race, religion, and community relations that Rahami's family faced during their time in Elizabeth.

Despite these allegations of discrimination, Mayor Christian Bollwage responded strongly, refuting the claims made by Rahami and his family. He attributed the tensions to legitimate noise complaints rather than any biases against their ethnicity or religion. Mayor Bollwage's statements reflect a broader trend of local officials navigating the complexities of civil rights claims while dealing with community-based conflicts.

The timeline of Rahami's grievances, as outlined in the 2011 lawsuit, underscores the emergence of a victim mentality that observers critique as indicative of larger societal trends in America. This mentality fosters an environment where individuals may seek to portray themselves as victims, potentially as a shield against accountability for their actions. In Rahami's case, the contrast between his claims of discrimination and the serious charges he faces for violent acts presents a disturbing juxtaposition—one that raises questions about the nature of victimhood in contemporary society.

Ultimately, the story of Ahmad Khan Rahami serves as a focal point for examining the complexities of victimhood and societal perceptions. As discussions around the “everyone gets a trophy generation” gain traction, this case exemplifies the challenges of navigating identity, discrimination, and accountability in America today. The narrative invites reflection on how victimhood is claimed and perceived, revealing deep-seated tensions that continue to shape community dynamics and personal narratives in an increasingly polarized society.",-38.0,-35.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,509.0,-1.9444444444444444,-0.068762278978389
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to move businesses if employees don't vote in their favor.

In the world of corporate politics, the relationship between employers and their employees has always been intricate, often tinged with threats and consequences. Throughout history, employers have resorted to implied or explicit threats of relocating their businesses as a way to pressure employees to vote in favor of corporate interests. Workers find themselves trapped between company loyalties and personal financial necessities, often facing adverse outcomes regardless of how they vote.

A recent controversy has arisen around Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, who has openly threatened economic repercussions should a Democrat take office. In a move reminiscent of the past threats made by Papa John’s founder John Schnatter, Puzder stated that if a Democrat is elected, he would consider automating his restaurants. This declaration serves as a stark warning to his approximately 20,000 employees, many of whom may be incentivized to vote against their own interests in an attempt to preserve their jobs.

Puzder’s advocacy for automation is not merely a fearmongering tactic; he points to technological advancements such as the automated fast food system Eatsa as a model for cost-efficient labor reduction. This strategy ultimately aligns with a broader trend where companies prioritize profit margins over maintaining a human workforce. Puzder argues that increasing the minimum wage would adversely affect job availability, questioning, ""Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?"" This perspective raises troubling questions about the sustainability of employee livelihoods in the face of corporate profitability.

The implications of Puzder's statements extend beyond mere political rhetoric; they force employees to confront the dichotomy between their well-being and the financial interests of their employer. Often, workers find themselves in no-win situations where adhering to employer preferences does not necessarily guarantee job security or better wages. In fact, even when votes align with employer expectations, many workers still encounter stagnant wages and the looming threat of outsourcing.

Puzder maintains a blog where he articulates his views on politics and capitalism, presenting a viewpoint that may not resonate with all his employees. While he climbs the ladder of corporate success, it’s noteworthy that his personal earnings were reported at nearly $4.5 million in 2012. This significant compensation starkly contrasts with the financial realities faced by his employees, who have seen little benefit from the company's profits over the years. 

Despite the political climate and the outcomes of impending elections, analysts expect Puzder to persist with his automation initiatives. His focus on maximizing profits appears to overshadow considerations of employee welfare, creating an environment rife with insecurity for those working under his leadership. 

As the election approaches, Puzder's statements raise crucial questions about the future of job security in the fast food industry and the ethical obligations that employers have towards their workforce. What happens to the individuals who may feel compelled to vote in alignment with corporate wishes, knowing that their livelihoods depend on the outcome of political battles beyond their control? The reality for many workers is that the allure of a higher wage does little to mitigate the risks posed by automation and outsourcing, which threaten their very roles.

In summary, the ongoing pressure placed on employees to sway their voting behavior in alignment with employer interests is indicative of a larger issue within corporate America. As leaders like Andy Puzder make it clear where their priorities lie—with profits rather than people—it becomes increasingly necessary to examine the implications of these choices on the future workforce. The evolving landscape of employment demands that workers consider not just their immediate financial hurdles, but the long-term sustainability and integrity of their positions in the face of relentless corporate maneuvering.",21.0,11.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,695.0,0.4583333333333333,0.015827338129496403
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a development that could shake the political landscape just weeks ahead of the election, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has commenced an investigation into new evidence linked to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server. The evidence has surfaced in connection with the inquiry into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's close aide Huma Abedin. Investigators are probing into a laptop shared by Abedin and Weiner, which reportedly holds tens of thousands of emails, potentially including those from Clinton's official account. These emails were never previously submitted to the FBI as part of its earlier investigation.

The implications of recovering these emails could be significant. If they are deemed to be classified or work-related communications, both Clinton and Abedin may have misled the FBI—an act that could carry serious legal consequences. The urgency of the situation was underscored by a letter from the FBI, released a mere eleven days before the presidential election, which detailed the seriousness of these findings and sparked renewed scrutiny on Clinton and her aides.

The inquiry into Clinton’s emails began in March 2015, but heightened when FBI Director James Comey publicly addressed the matter on July 5, 2016. He acknowledged evidence suggesting potential wrongdoing by Clinton and her associates, yet controversially recommended against pressing charges. This decision ignited widespread dismay among FBI officials, many of whom believed that Clinton should be prosecuted and that her security clearance should be revoked due to her handling of classified information.

A subsequent 100-page summary released by the FBI also revealed inappropriate pressure from a State Department official who was involved in matters regarding classified information pertaining to Clinton’s emails. According to this summary, this interference raised further questions about the integrity of the investigations into Clinton's email usage.

Compounding the controversy was the discovery of a group referred to as ""The Shadow Government"" concerning Clinton’s email inquiries. The existence of this group has been described as a factor in the complex web of issues surrounding her use of a private email server for official communications, leading to speculation about the nature and intent behind these activities.

Additionally, objections have surfaced in light of allegations that a longtime supporter of Clinton made a $500,000 donation to an FBI official's wife. This claim raises concerns about possible conflicts of interest and the integrity of the investigative process that has been scrutinizing Clinton's actions.

Another critical development in this ongoing saga involves Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who played a role in the deletion of over 33,000 emails from Clinton’s private server. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department, which has further inflamed accusations of improprieties regarding the handling of classified material and communications.

In a lack of transparency, communications between Clinton and President Obama have also been revealed to have occurred via her private email server, directly contradicting both individuals' previous claims. This revelation suggests a coordinated effort to mislead not only the FBI but also the American public regarding the nature of their communications, thus intensifying the scrutiny on both leaders.

The timeline of key events surrounding the Clinton email investigation has depicted a rolling saga of miscommunication and obfuscation that began in 2015. As inquiries unfolded, moments leading up to the release of the FBI's letter in October 2016 illustrated actions taken to delete emails in the wake of a subpoena, indicating a potential cover-up of significant governmental misconduct.

As the investigation unfolds, many Americans remain watchful of its implications, particularly as the election draws near. The discovery of new evidence in the form of thousands of potentially unturned emails poses a critical juncture for the candidates involved and could ultimately influence the political atmosphere heading into the upcoming vote. The ethical considerations and legal ramifications surrounding this investigation go beyond any single individual, reflecting a broader concern about the integrity of public office and trust in government officials.

Whether this revelation will sway voter sentiment or catalyze a plan of action among lawmakers and law enforcement remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the ramifications of this investigation will be felt widely, and the quest for transparency and accountability continues to hang in the balance.",-6.0,-5.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,791.0,-0.19230769230769232,-0.006321112515802781
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In recent developments, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has encountered significant backlash regarding her open borders policy for Syrian refugees. This approach, which initially aimed to provide sanctuary to those fleeing conflict, has led to a considerable influx of migrants into Germany. However, the ramifications have been felt deeply within German society, as crime rates surged alongside the rising number of refugees.

Reports indicate that as thousands of asylum seekers arrived, incidents of crime escalated, including numerous sexual assaults and acts of violence. This alarming trend sparked a wave of discontent among the German public. The dissatisfaction culminated in the electoral defeat of Merkel's conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which was voted out by a notable margin. The changing tides of public opinion have placed Merkel's previous migration policies under intense scrutiny.

Reflecting on the situation, Merkel has openly acknowledged that the migrant crisis might have been preventable and conveyed regret over her earlier stance, describing multiculturalism as a “living lie.” During her party’s annual conference, she confronted the realities of the nations’ challenges, asserting that while she once believed “we can do this,” it is evident that Germany could become overwhelmed by the current high levels of migration.

In response to the ongoing situation, Merkel announced her intention to curtail the number of refugees entering the country. However, she refrained from specifying a concrete limit on arrivals, indicating a cautious approach in navigating this contentious issue. She emphasized the importance of implementing a balanced strategy to manage migration across both national and European frameworks.

While developments in Germany remain critical, experts caution that potential consequences could also extend beyond its borders, particularly impacting nations like the United States. The experiences and reactions of the German public may serve as a pivotal lesson for policymakers grappling with similar migration challenges. As Merkel continues to address these complex and contentious issues, the outlook for Germany's migration policy remains uncertain, with significant implications both domestically and internationally.",-2.0,-17.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,389.0,-1.2142857142857142,-0.043701799485861184

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or

In a striking contrast that has ignited public outrage, the recent arrest of a terrorist responsible for planting explosives in New Jersey and New York City has highlighted the disparity in healthcare treatment between individuals who commit heinous acts and the U.S. veterans who have served the country. This dichotomy raises critical questions about the nation’s priorities in providing healthcare services.

The terrorist, apprehended by law enforcement, is expected to receive extensive medical care while undergoing legal proceedings, a stark juxtaposition to the experiences of countless veterans who face debilitating waits for adequate medical attention. Many veterans currently contend with extensive waiting lists at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a situation that echoes the 2014 VA scandal that unveiled significant inefficiencies and alarming waiting times. 

Former President Donald Trump expressed his gratitude to law enforcement officials for their swift action in apprehending the terrorist but did not shy away from addressing the troubling quality of care that the apprehended individual will potentially receive. “Here we are, providing high-quality care to a terrorist while over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care from the VA,” Trump stated, encapsulating the frustration felt by many.

The numbers reveal a tragic tale of veterans who have succumbed to the emotional and physical toll of waiting for medical support. Reports have highlighted that many veterans have tragically taken their own lives while enduring delays for care, with some heart-wrenching incidents occurring in VA parking lots, emphasizing the dire consequences of systemic issues within the healthcare system designated for those who have served in the armed forces.

The debate intensifies as many question the government's priorities when it seems that a terrorist is rendered priority access to superior medical care compared to those who defended the nation. Medical professionals are further burdened by the moral dilemma they face when tasked with providing treatment to individuals who have inflicted harm on society, which complicates their ethos of care for all patients, regardless of their past actions.

This situation sheds light on a broader issue of accountability and the pressing need for systemic reform within the VA. As Americans reflect on these disparities, the conversation opens the door to necessary discussions about how the healthcare system prioritizes care, ultimately challenging the nation to ensure that the needs of those who honorably served are met and that their sacrifices are recognized and respected.",13.0,-9.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,442.0,-0.8181818181818182,-0.020361990950226245
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, has emerged as a notable figure in the wake of a recent terrorist attack. Responding to an ISIS terrorist who assaulted eight individuals, Falconer took decisive action, ultimately shooting and killing the assailant. His swift response has been hailed by many as an act of heroism and a strong defense of his fellow citizens.

Falconer’s commitments do not end with his on-the-ground bravery. He is also the owner of Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., a business dedicated to equipping law-abiding citizens with essential firearm skills and self-defense techniques. Tactical Advantage operates a full-service training facility which features a firing range and offers firearms sales, catering to a community increasingly invested in personal safety.

However, it appears that Falconer's success has placed him in the crosshairs of political antagonism. Reports indicate that Hillary Clinton, should she be elected president, has expressed intentions to target Falconer’s business. Her strategy reportedly includes measures that could lead to bankruptcy for Tactical Advantage, potentially crippling Falconer’s efforts to provide firearms training and education.

Central to the political dynamics surrounding Falconer's business is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), enacted in 2005. This legislation grants limited legal protection to businesses engaged in the lawful sale and transfer of firearms, recognizing the unique challenges faced by the gun industry. Unfortunately, Clinton has articulated plans to eliminate this protection, which would expose gun-related businesses like Falconer’s to a barrage of legal challenges that could significantly undermine their operations.

Critics of Clinton’s position argue that her actions pose a direct threat to the Second Amendment and the rights of responsible gun owners across the nation. Falconer’s case exemplifies a broader struggle between gun rights advocates and those seeking to impose tighter regulations on firearms businesses. Supporters of Falconer believe that his experience as both a firearms instructor and a police officer equips him with invaluable expertise needed to educate citizens on responsible gun ownership and safety.

In light of the terrorist attack he bravely addressed, many see Falconer not only as an instructor but also as a protector of the community who stood up when it mattered most. His response to the attack demonstrated his commitment to safeguarding the lives of others, with many praising his actions as exemplary of the courage needed in facing modern threats.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Falconer’s story serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by those in the firearms community amid shifting legislative priorities. His steadfast approach to training citizens in responsible firearm use underscores the importance of personal safety and self-defense, principles that he continues to champion through his business endeavors.

With the future of the PLCAA hanging in the balance, and the specter of potential bankruptcy looming over Tactical Advantage, the intersection of Falconer’s mission and political ambitions raises pertinent questions about the rights of gun owners and the value of preparedness in an increasingly unpredictable world.

As citizens and lawmakers ponder the implications of these developments, Jason Falconer remains resolute in his commitment to protect others, while his business aims to empower individuals through education on responsible firearm ownership. In the face of adversity, Falconer’s dedication exemplifies the resilience and resourcefulness of those who seek to uphold their rights and responsibilities in a complex legal and political landscape.",-11.0,26.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,644.0,1.1304347826086956,0.040372670807453416
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air. It’s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack — *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Hillary Clinton’s health has emerged as a focal point for discussion among voters and analysts alike. Recent polling data reveals a concerning trend among registered voters, with over 40% now perceiving Clinton’s health to be ""below average"" or ""very poor."" This figure marks a notable increase from just 26% in late August, indicating that perceptions of her health are rapidly deteriorating as Election Day draws nearer.

In contrast, about 28% of voters rate Clinton’s health as ""average."" Meanwhile, her opponent, Donald Trump, has experienced a shift in health perceptions among voters, with his favorable rating increasing from 33% to 36% within the same timeframe. This change has further complicated the electoral landscape, as voters weigh the health of both candidates in their decision-making process.

An overwhelming 80% of respondents surveyed are aware of the potential medical issues surrounding Clinton, raising questions about the impact of her health on her campaign. Observers note that Clinton, now 68 years old, seems to appear older than her age, which amplifies existing concerns about her well-being. Speculations have intensified following reports that she is taking Coumadin—an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots—and is researching Provigil, a medication usually given for serious health disorders, particularly sleep-related issues.

The scrutiny over Clinton’s health has heightened as recent accounts describe her needing assistance in various situations, exhibiting symptoms of confusion during public engagements, and experiencing distressing coughing fits. These incidents, captured in images and videos, have become fodder for public debate, leading to increased scrutiny regarding her capability to serve as president.

Moreover, the public's concern has been compounded by alarming accounts of Clinton physically collapsing at the 9/11 Memorial, an incident that elicited widespread reactions and generated further scrutiny. Controversial claims have since emerged, suggesting that footage of this collapse is being systematically removed from the internet, stirring up conspiracy theories and igniting discussions about transparency in the political arena. 

The implications of these health concerns appear to be manifesting in tangible ways. Reports have indicated a notable decline in attendance at Clinton’s campaign rallies, with many speculating that these events are not being promoted as vigorously as those of her opponent. Critics argue that this could be a calculated move, stemming from fears about the potential impact of her health disclosure on voter support.

As the campaign continues, the narrative surrounding Clinton’s health could influence voter sentiment significantly. With voters becoming increasingly aware of her medical history, the challenge for her campaign will be to address health-related concerns effectively and transparently. 

With the presidential election drawing closer, the electorate faces the prospect of choosing a leader whose health and vitality are being debated heavily. As for Clinton, maintaining a strong public image amid ongoing health speculations remains critical. How she navigates this challenge will likely play a major role in her campaign's trajectory as she seeks to regain ground lost in the shifting perceptions of her candidacy.

Overall, as the campaign enters its final stages, voters are faced with vital questions about the candidates' abilities to serve in a demanding role, which hinges significantly on their respective health profiles. The conversations surrounding Clinton in particular will continue evolving, especially amid constant public scrutiny and media coverage.

In an election marked by division and intensity, the subject of health is likely to remain a prominent aspect of the voter narrative, as both campaigns grapple with presenting their candidates in the best light possible. As the polls reflect, health continues to be a pivotal issue for those making decisions at the ballot box, and the implications for candidates like Clinton are significant as they strive to capture voter confidence amid rising concerns.",-11.0,10.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,714.0,0.4,0.014005602240896359

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

The book paints a controversial picture of Hillary Clinton, alleging that she possesses a condescending attitude toward those she perceives as beneath her and characterizing her as an opportunist.

In the memoir, Kyle shares intimate details about her relationship with Bill Clinton, which began when she was just 11 years old and continued through her high school years. This personal history serves as a backdrop for her assertions about Hillary's personality and behavior. Notably, she recounts a troubling incident during an Easter egg hunt in which Hillary allegedly exhibited frustration towards developmentally challenged children, using derogatory language to describe them.

Kyle claims that Hillary referred to these children as ""f*****g ree-tards,"" a revelation that paints a disturbing picture of the former First Lady’s attitude. Furthermore, upon moving to Arkansas, Hillary allegedly looked down upon the locals, whom she considered ""ignorant hillbillies,"" suggesting a profound sense of superiority.

Adding further to the narrative, Kyle notes that during her time campaigning in New York, Hillary self-identified as a lifelong Yankees fan, a point that may resonate with her supporters. However, the book also touches upon the Clintons' dissatisfaction with life in Arkansas, leading Bill Clinton to decline running for reelection in 1990 as he pivoted his ambitions towards the presidency.

*Hillary: The Other Woman* is sure to spark conversations and debates as readers digest Kyle's allegations and their implications for the public perception of one of America's most prominent political figures.",-10.0,-2.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,327.0,-0.2,-0.0061162079510703364

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a landmark decision, a judge in Massachusetts has ruled on a special law that addresses the unique experiences of black males during police encounters. The ruling stems from the acknowledgment that some black Americans hold a legitimate fear of police, a concern that could drive individuals to flee from law enforcement officers in stressful situations.

Under this new ruling, individuals who perceive themselves to be ""disproportionately"" targeted by police will now have the legal option to evade arrest without facing typical legal repercussions for running from law enforcement. This groundbreaking decision marks a significant shift in the landscape of interactions between police and certain members of the community, particularly among black males who have historically experienced a fraught relationship with law enforcement.

The judge's ruling raises complex questions regarding public safety and the overall effectiveness of police officers in Massachusetts. Traditionally, fleeing from police could establish ""reasonable suspicion"" that allowed officers to detain individuals and investigate further. This new legal precedent may challenge that long-standing practice, complicating how police officers engage with suspects who might perceive their actions through the lens of disproportionate targeting.

While proponents of the ruling argue that it is a necessary response to the unique social dynamics faced by black males, critics have raised substantial concerns. They assert that the decision undermines police authority and hinders their ability to effectively protect and serve the community. The apprehension surrounding this ruling suggests a potential rift between law enforcement and the public they are sworn to protect, as some question the implications of allowing individuals to evade arrest under these conditions.

Supporters of the ruling contend that it offers a necessary safeguard for individuals who feel the repercussions of systemic biases in law enforcement practices. By recognizing the psychological burden that fear of police can impose, the ruling attempts to create space for dialogue and understanding regarding racial dynamics and law enforcement. 

As the public absorbs the ramifications of this ruling, discussions about police practices and community safety are expected to intensify. The decision is poised to spark debates not only about how law enforcement interacts with the communities they serve but also about the broader implications for justice and equality under the law.

The ruling has the potential to reshape the how police engage during encounters, leaving many to wonder how such changes will manifest in day-to-day policing and whether it will ultimately benefit the community or further complicate police work. In light of these developments, Massachusetts finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with the balance between community relations and public safety as it moves forward in the realm of law enforcement reform.",-13.0,-2.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,487.0,-0.125,-0.004106776180698152
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Sansaricq pointed to the rampant corruption following the catastrophic 2010 earthquake in Haiti, asserting that aid was delayed as funds were mishandled. He charged that the Clintons exploited the disaster for personal gain, claiming they extracted billions from the Haitian people.

Despite the significant donations funneled to the Clinton Foundation, Sansaricq lamented that many Haitians remain in dire conditions, living in tents and struggling to make ends meet. He demanded transparency about the financial aid received by the foundation and its allocation, emphasizing the need for accountability in the wake of such humanitarian crises.

Adding to his allegations, Sansaricq recounted an incident during which he was allegedly offered a bribe by former President Bill Clinton. He stated that his refusal of the offer resulted in the revocation of his visa, a move he deemed retaliatory.

This statement comes amidst ongoing protests against the Clinton Foundation's involvement in Haiti, which were notably prominent during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. As the debate over the foundation’s impact in Haiti intensifies, Sansaricq’s claims underscore calls for scrutiny and transparency in international humanitarian efforts.",-27.0,-23.0,255.0,-2.4545454545454546,-0.10588235294117647,234.0,-2.5555555555555554,-0.09829059829059829
Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid acknowledgment of her leadership during one of Europe’s most challenging moments, German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance. Her remarks signal a potential shift in Germany’s approach to refugee admissions amid rising anti-migrant sentiment, particularly following the resounding defeat of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party in the recent elections in Berlin.

The Berlin election outcomes highlighted a significant political shift in Germany, marked by increasing support for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Merkel expressed her willingness to reconsider Germany’s refugee stance, explaining that her experiences during the 2015 refugee crisis left her feeling unprepared for the overwhelming influx of asylum-seekers at the time. Taking stock of the CDU's poor electoral performance, the Chancellor took responsibility for the mounting dissatisfaction among voters regarding migration policies.

Merkel's comments come at a crucial juncture for her party, given the sharp rise in anti-migrant sentiment fueled by concerns over terrorism and crime often associated with refugee populations. These anxieties have positioned the AfD as a formidable force in German politics, making the stakes even higher for the CDU in the looming federal elections.

Despite acknowledging her regrets regarding her policies, Merkel firmly dismissed any notions of implementing significant policy changes. She particularly resisted demands from the Christian Social Union (CSU), her party’s Bavarian sister party, to impose a cap on migrant intake or to prioritize Christian refugees over their Muslim counterparts. According to Merkel, such actions would contradict the fundamental principles of her party and the values that Germany stands for.

Tensions within the ruling coalition have been exacerbated by these discussions, as CSU leader Horst Seehofer warned that he might withdraw his support for Merkel due to her steadfastness on migration policies. The potential fracturing of this alliance raises questions about the stability of Merkel's government moving forward.

Amid the shifting political landscape, Merkel’s reluctance to significantly revise her migration policy could come back to haunt her party as they prepare for future elections. Observers speculate that her continued adherence to progressive migration policies might alienate a segment of the electorate increasingly drawn to the AfD’s more nationalist and restrictive approach.

As the debate around migration intensifies, Merkel’s latest candid acknowledgment serves as an important reminder of the complexities facing leaders who navigate the intersection of humanitarian obligations and public sentiment. The burgeoning anti-migrant climate in Germany illustrates how deeply the refugee crisis continues to reverberate within the political sphere, challenging the tenets of Merkel’s long-standing policies.

The road ahead for Germany’s political landscape remains uncertain, and the implications of Merkel’s admission may shape strategies not only within the CDU but also across the wider European Union as member states grapple with their own migration challenges in the wake of shifting public opinions.

In these pivotal moments, the balancing act of governance becomes increasingly precarious, as leaders must contend with the realities of public sentiment while aspiring to uphold cherished values of compassion and inclusivity in the face of adversity.",-14.0,-12.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,579.0,-0.6666666666666666,-0.02072538860103627
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

Sundsvall, Sweden – A shocking case involving a Somali asylum seeker has drawn the ire of local residents and raised questions about societal values surrounding violence and respect for human rights. Abdullah, who has a background marked by multiple violent crimes, including assaults and molestations, has ignited outrage following a brutal attack on his pregnant wife.

Living in Sweden for the past five years, Abdullah has relied solely on welfare benefits since his arrival, raising concerns among those who feel that state resources should be allocated to individuals cultivating a positive role within society. His troublesome history paints a troubling picture of a man grappling with issues far larger than mere economic dependency.

The incident that has garnered public attention occurred after Abdullah had spent a night partying. Upon returning home, he confronted his wife regarding her niece, whom she was babysitting. He demanded that the child be gone by the time he returned, a request that, under the circumstances, struck many as unreasonable. When Abdullah found the niece still present, his reaction was explosive. Eyewitness accounts describe a harrowing scene where Abdullah violently assaulted his wife, including kicking her in the head and stomach.

The assailant's actions did not end with the physical assault. In a move that many have described as deeply humiliating, Abdullah poured beer on his wife and urinated on her, actions that highlight a grievous disregard for human dignity and personal respect. This distressing behavior has sparked outrage both from local communities and human rights advocates, who view such incidents as unacceptable.

Critics have drawn attention to Abdullah's selective engagement with religious texts, particularly the Quran, which speaks of the treatment of disobedient wives. The actions he perpetrated on his wife starkly contradict the teachings of compassion, respect, and fairness that many associate with Islamic principles. Residents have expressed their disdain for the apparent hypocrisy in Abdullah’s behavior, pointing to his use of religious justification for actions that are fundamentally at odds with the core values of love and protection that are foundational in many interpretations of faith.

As the investigation unfolds, awareness about issues concerning asylum seekers and their integration into Swedish society is being reignited. Many are calling for a critical examination of support structures in place for individuals with violent backgrounds, stressing the urgent need for effective rehabilitation measures.

This case serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges faced by communities in dealing with complex issues surrounding crime, integration, and the responsibilities that accompany asylum. With a spotlight now cast upon Abdullah's actions, the people of Sundsvall and wider Swedish society are left grappling with the implications of his behavior and the systems that have failed both him and his victim.

The response of authorities and community leaders in the wake of this violent episode remains to be seen, with many hoping this may serve as a catalyst for meaningful change concerning both the treatment of women and the support of vulnerable populations.",-28.0,-33.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,559.0,-1.65,-0.059033989266547404
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

As the polarizing political atmosphere intensifies in the lead-up to the next election, Pennsylvania Republicans are advancing House Bill 29, which stands to significantly alter the voting landscape in the Commonwealth. Initially proposed in June, the bill seeks to allow individuals from outside a voter's district to monitor polling places and challenge the legitimacy of voters. Critics warn that such measures could disrupt the electoral process and become a tool for voter intimidation.

House Bill 29 introduces a framework that permits those who do not reside in a voting district to challenge voters on Election Day. The potential for confusion and confrontation at polling places is high, and experts are expressing deep concern about the ramifications this could have on voter turnout, especially among marginalized communities. Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice stated that this legislation could lead to discriminatory challenges that may disproportionately target voters based on race, religion, or other identifying factors. The subsequent delays at polling stations and longer lines could further discourage individuals from exercising their right to vote, heightening tensions on what is meant to be a democratic process.

The push for House Bill 29 aligns with former President Donald Trump's ongoing narrative surrounding voter fraud. Trump's explicit calls for his supporters to monitor Pennsylvania polling places have resonated with many within the party, setting the stage for a confrontation at the ballot box. Trump has publicly asserted that challenges from poll watchers are critical to securing victory in Pennsylvania, which he deems vital for any future electoral success. 

In a notable development, an amendment to House Bill 29 stipulates that the legislation would take effect immediately upon passage, circumventing the typical waiting period of 60 days. This rapid implementation is seen as a strategic move to ensure that the bill is in place ahead of upcoming elections, raising eyebrows among voting rights advocates. Opponents of the bill argue that such haste disregards the potential risks and consequences associated with legitimizing outside interference in local electoral processes.

The ramifications of enacting this legislation go beyond Pennsylvania. Observers are concerned that, if successful, it could set a dangerous precedent for similar laws in other states, further entrenching voter intimidation tactics within the electoral process across the nation. Ultimately, if House Bill 29 becomes law, it may not only impact the immediate election but could ripple out to affect future voting behaviors, leading to an environment where intimidation and chaos could undermine public confidence in fair elections.

The atmosphere is charged as discussions surrounding House Bill 29 continue, with advocates for voting rights rallying against the proposed measures. As the legislative process unfolds, it remains to be seen how Republican lawmakers and the public will respond to the criticisms leveled at this controversial bill. The stakes are high, and the outcome could pave the way for an era of heightened scrutiny and challenges at the polls, altering how elections are conducted in Pennsylvania and potentially beyond. With the foundation of democracy at risk, the urgency for informed and engaged citizenry in the realm of electoral politics has never been more pronounced.",-19.0,-22.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,582.0,-1.1,-0.037800687285223365

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, a trailblazing American Olympian fencer and the first athlete to compete in the Olympics wearing a Hijab, is raising alarm about her safety in the United States. In a candid revelation, Muhammad recounted a distressing experience where an individual followed her home with the intent to report her to the police. This incident has left her feeling vulnerable in a country that largely champions diversity and inclusion.

Muhammad has not shied away from discussing the broader context of racialized violence in America. She pointed to racially charged events, such as the tragic North Carolina shooting, which took the lives of three Muslim students, and the often-negative media portrayals surrounding the Khan family. These reflections highlight a climate of tension and suspicion that many Muslims in the U.S. have faced.

Despite Muhammad's concerns, there is room for debate regarding America’s label as an “Islamophobic” country. While hate crimes against Muslims should never be dismissed, statistics indicate that Jews experience even higher rates of targeted violence. This begs the question of whether the perception of rampant Islamophobia accurately encapsulates the complexities of racial dynamics in the nation.

The article also raises a critical consideration about Muhammad's choice to stay in the United States, even as she articulates her grievances. If she perceives the environment to be so inhospitable, why continue residing in a country that, according to some metrics and personal experiences, may offer better treatment for Muslims compared to certain Muslim-majority nations?

While acknowledging Muhammad's feelings of distress, the argument is made that she, like many, has the resilience to navigate isolated incidents of racial profiling. Given the potential threats faced by individuals in other countries, the discourse should focus on fostering understanding while navigating personal and systemic challenges in the U.S. Ultimately, the complexities surrounding discussions on racism and identity merit careful consideration, as America continues its journey towards inclusivity.",-23.0,-20.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,366.0,-1.4285714285714286,-0.0546448087431694
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In a startling turn of events, protests in Charlotte descended into violence this week following a confrontation in which a black police officer shot a black suspect. The incident has sparked widespread unrest, yet the motivations behind the protests raise questions about the validity of the demonstrators' actions.

Critics of the protests have denounced the participants, labeling them as ""idiots"" and ""thugs"" who are inciting chaos rather than seeking justice. Observers argue that the racial underpinnings that typically fuel such protests are irrelevant in this particular case, as the facts surrounding the shooting do not necessarily support a narrative of systemic racism or inequality.

Amidst the tumult, reports surfaced of demonstrators mocking an injured police officer instead of lending assistance. This behavior highlights a concerning trend among certain protest groups, who, instead of contributing to constructive dialogue, seem more focused on exacerbating the situation. Such actions not only reflect irresponsibility but also disregard the pressing need for positive societal contributions.

The scene in Charlotte rapidly devolved into pandemonium, with incidents of violence erupting amongst the protesters themselves. Eyewitness accounts describe a particularly alarming moment when one individual was shot by another, illustrating the chaos that unfolded on the streets. This escalation in violence only serves to undermine the initial grievances that the protests aimed to address.

Critics have pointed out a significant contradiction within the protest movement: if ""black lives mattered,"" there would be no justification for internal violence among those claiming to advocate for life and justice. The actions of these protesters raise important questions about the integrity of their cause and whether the message they intend to convey is being lost amidst the chaos.

Furthermore, the demographics of those rallying behind the Black Lives Matter movement have come under scrutiny. Detractors argue that many supporters display a lack of education and an inclination towards violence, perpetuating negative stereotypes associated with the movement. This characterization paints a troubling picture of the individuals involved and raises doubts about the legitimacy of their demands.

Expressions of disdain for the Black Lives Matter movement itself have become increasingly vocal in light of recent events. Many argue that the movement is more focused on racial identity than on the actions and behaviors that they deem unacceptable. By emphasizing actions over race in their judgment of others, critics contend that a more productive conversation can begin about the real issues at hand.

As the dust settles in Charlotte, the lingering question remains: how can a movement that seeks to promote life and justice coexist with acts of violence and disrespect towards law enforcement? The chaotic scenes in Charlotte have opened the door for a broader dialogue about the means through which social change is pursued, and whether those means are ultimately serving or undermining the cause.

In conclusion, the events in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in social movements. While protests can amplify important issues, the manner in which they are conducted holds significant weight in public perception and the potential for meaningful change. As the city navigates the aftermath of this violence, it remains clear that a reevaluation of tactics, messaging, and accountability is essential for progress. The challenge will be to foster a narrative that not only calls for justice but also promotes unity in the face of adversity.",-83.0,-57.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,618.0,-2.375,-0.09223300970873786
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In a significant address this week at the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama reaffirmed his identity as a far-left progressive liberal, stirring both support and dissent among various factions in the United States. His speech, which emphasized a vision of a one world order guided by international law, focused on the need for collective action and shared responsibility among nations.

Central to Obama's policy legacy are the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and increased acceptance for refugees, all reflective of his progressive ideology. During his speech, he made a provocative statement suggesting that the United States may need to relinquish some individual freedoms to advance global security. While he argued that the right to self-defense remains the only non-negotiable freedom, this comment elicited sharp criticism from many Americans who perceive it as a troubling encroachment on personal liberties.

Obama acknowledged the backlash he has faced for his views, yet he stood resolutely by his beliefs, indicating that he is unmoved by the discontent expressed by some of his compatriots. This unwavering stance has drawn frustration from critics, who feel that his perceived arrogance and lack of willingness to compromise exemplify the deeper divisiveness currently plaguing Washington D.C.

The article likens Obama’s approach to that of parents who fail to model the values they preach to their children, highlighting a disconnect between his ideals and the practical realities many Americans face. The frustration resonates with those who believe that a more balanced and pragmatic approach is necessary to bridge the growing chasm in political discourse.

As Obama’s tenure is revisited in the context of contemporary debates over national security and individual freedoms, his final speech at the UN serves as both a reminder of his enduring influence and a point of contention for an increasingly polarized electorate. Whether his vision of international cooperation can be reconciled with the principles of American freedom remains a contentious question.",13.0,10.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,365.0,0.9090909090909091,0.0273972602739726
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the ever-evolving realm of the National Football League (NFL), two prominent figures stand out not as starting quarterbacks, but as polarizing symbols of contrasting narratives: Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. While both athletes have made headlines over the years, the public perception surrounding them could not be more different.

Tim Tebow is often portrayed as a well-respected individual, embodying strong values and a steadfast character. His commitment to belief stands in stark contrast to the ongoing controversies surrounding Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick, who famously protested during the National Anthem, continues to face criticism, with many viewing his actions as disrespectful. This disapproval is amplified by the context of Kaepernick's current status as a non-starting player, despite earning millions from his contracts.

When asked about Kaepernick's protest, Tebow chose to focus on standing firmly for one's beliefs, yet his comments remained limited, suggesting a strategic approach to avoid negative press. With Tebow currently pursuing a career in professional baseball with the New York Mets, the general sentiment surrounding him continues to lean positive, reflecting hopes that he might find success on the diamond. 

On the flip side, Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the National Anthem has ignited a fervent discussion about respect, patriotism, and the role of athletes in social justice movements. Critics of Kaepernick argue that, despite his salary and platform, he should reserve his protests for personal time rather than using prestigious moments during games to air grievances. Such sentiments raise complex questions about the appropriateness of political statements in sports, fueling the belief that sportsmanship and patriotism should coexist harmoniously.

Further probing into the narrative of oppression in the United States, the piece adopts a strikingly assertive tone. It firmly posits that no one in the country is truly oppressed, presenting assertions of oppression as mere excuses for laziness. The article references the presidency of Barack Obama as a pivotal example, reflecting on his hard work and determination to secure his place in history, which seemingly counters the narrative of systematic oppression. This stance expresses significant disdain for the concept of oppression and even criticizes initiatives like Affirmative Action, suggesting that such policies are misplaced in today’s society.

As the discussion surrounding these two quarterbacks unfolds, it reveals much about the current cultural and social climate in the U.S. Tebow’s image as a respected figure, juxtaposed against Kaepernick’s controversial public persona, encapsulates a deeper division on how values, success, and activism are perceived in the realm of sports. With the article concluding on a hopeful note for Tebow's sporting endeavors, it stops short of extending similar goodwill toward Kaepernick, encapsulating a notable divergence in public sentiment.",-6.0,6.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,514.0,0.35294117647058826,0.011673151750972763
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

As debates surrounding immigration and national security intensify, the focus on the U.S.-Mexico border wall has become more pronounced. Advocates argue that the wall plays a critical role in not just deterring illegal immigration but also safeguarding the nation against potential threats. This perspective draws historical parallels to the Great Wall of China, which was erected as a defense against foreign invaders, underscoring the need for similar protective measures in the United States.

The urgency of these protective measures is compounded by the prevailing influence of powerful drug cartels in Mexico, which have been linked to escalating violence and a high death toll, echoing the levels of brutality often associated with terrorist organizations like ISIS. This alarming situation prompts concerns that groups such as ISIS could exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. border security to infiltrate the country.

A recent incident has highlighted these security apprehensions. Reports surfaced that eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally cross into the United States from Mexico, sparking increased vigilance among security agencies following the Paris terror attacks. While these individuals were reportedly intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, details remain under review, with official confirmation from Border Patrol still pending.

Hector Garza, president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, has voiced the concerns of agents working on the front lines. He asserts that the potential for Syrian crossings is a legitimate worry, underlining the necessity for bolstered border security. Adding to the complexity of the situation, Garza claimed that approximately 80% of individuals apprehended while attempting to enter the U.S. illegally are not deported, allowing them to remain within the country and potentially undermining national security efforts.

Garza's commentary amplifies the calls from many within the law enforcement community for more robust border security measures, emphasizing the need for adequate resources and support for Border Patrol personnel. As the stakes continue to rise, the discourse around immigration and border security is expected to remain a focal point in political arenas.

Notably, amidst these discussions, only one presidential candidate has emerged as a prominent advocate for addressing border security and immigration issues head-on. As the nation grapples with these pressing concerns, the call for comprehensive solutions will likely dominate political platforms in the months leading up to the election.",-13.0,-8.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,426.0,-0.5333333333333333,-0.018779342723004695

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

At a recent event, members of the Haitian community expressed notable discontent with U.S. political figures, particularly the Clintons, while showing robust support for Donald Trump. The media's early departure before audience members could share their experiences has raised questions about the coverage of critical discussions surrounding Haiti's past and present.

Attendees at the event voiced strong support for Trump, responding enthusiastically as they recounted their stories. Many expressed dissatisfaction with the Clintons, criticizing their handling of financial aid intended for Haiti. Audience members claimed that once donations were made, the Clintons became unavailable, and they accused the couple of allowing significant funds to be redirected away from those in need in Haiti. Allegations surfaced that money earmarked for Haitian aid allegedly went to Washington lobbyists and ultimately returned to the political elite in the White House.

Furthermore, there were specific accusations against Hillary Clinton regarding her opposition to increasing Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5, which attendees viewed as detrimental to the nation's working class. Despite the evident criticism of Hillary and the audience's favor for Trump, media representatives reportedly struggled to find an angle that portrayed Trump negatively.

The media's abrupt exit from the event before hearing the audience's perspectives has sparked concerns over their interest and responsibility in accurately reporting the sentiments of the Haitian community during a pivotal time. These unfiltered voices underscore a complex narrative about aid, politics, and community sentiment that deserves attention.",-2.0,3.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,283.0,0.3,0.01060070671378092
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a significant shift in public opinion, a recent poll has revealed that nearly half of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration, a topic that has generated heated discussions both domestically and internationally. This surge in support aligns with sentiments expressed by political figures, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, who proposed a similar ban in response to perceived terrorism threats.

Trump's controversial remarks about banning Muslim immigration prompted accusations of racism from Democrats, who argue that such views reflect a bias against individuals based on their faith rather than their ethnicity. The article argues that racism generally involves beliefs centered on racial superiority; however, since Islam is a religion and not a race, it is subject to different interpretations, including the potential for radicalization. Trump himself characterized the ban as a temporary measure aimed at addressing pressing terrorism concerns rather than a systemic issue with Islam.

In the latest poll, it was found that 49% of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration—an increase from 28% just a year prior. This dramatic rise signifies a growing urgency among the populace regarding national security and immigration practices. Additionally, 48% of respondents expressed their desire for a national debate on this contentious topic, indicating that the conversation surrounding Muslim immigration is far from settled.

A notable figure in this discourse is populist senator Pauline Hanson, who has raised eyebrows by tackling issues often regarded as taboo. Two-thirds of those surveyed believe Hanson successfully addresses subjects that mainstream politicians might shy away from, further emphasizing the demand for transparency and dialogue on immigration matters.

The main reasons articulated by those in favor of a ban predominantly revolve around fears of terrorism and a belief that Muslim migrants struggle to assimilate into traditional Australian values. This perspective resonates across various political affiliations, with 60% of Coalition supporters endorsing the ban, alongside 40% of Labour voters, and a surprising 34% of Green voters agreeing with the sentiment. These figures illustrate that support for restricting Muslim migration cannot be dismissed as merely a fringe opinion.

The pollster conducting the survey underscored the significance of this support, noting that it reflects a meaningful and substantial segment of the population. Dismissing such viewpoints outright may inadvertently suppress an essential discussion surrounding the complexities of immigration and national security. The article critiques the tendency to treat opposing views dismissively, encouraging a recognition of the broader concerns underpinning the dramatic rise in support for a ban on Muslim immigration.

In a country known for its diverse culture, the surge in support for restrictive immigration policies challenges the very foundations of tolerance and multiculturalism that define Australian society. It provokes questions about how Australia will navigate the balance between national security and the values of openness and acceptance that have historically guided its immigration policy.

As the national debate intensifies, it remains essential for policymakers and citizens alike to engage in meaningful discourse regarding these pressing issues. To dismiss significant segments of public opinion as fringe may lead to further polarization and hinder the potential for a productive dialogue on the complexities surrounding immigration, security, and Australian identity. In light of the increasing concerns and prevailing beliefs, Australia finds itself at a pivotal moment that will shape its immigration landscape for years to come.",2.0,2.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,616.0,0.09523809523809523,0.003246753246753247

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on

In a shocking turn of events, a street scene laden with expectation erupted into chaos, as an anticipated fight spiraled into an act of unexpected violence. Witnesses found themselves grappling with a disturbing spectacle, as individuals involved in the altercation were set ablaze, leaving the community in a state of disbelief and horror.

The origin of this incident has drawn scrutiny, particularly following allegations by Buzzfeed that the portrayal of the crime and its victims in earlier reports may have been mischaracterized. In an attempt to clarify the situation, Buzzfeed released a follow-up article firmly defending the original claims, acknowledging the confusion surrounding the event while maintaining the integrity of their reporting. This ongoing discourse raises pressing concerns about the narratives shaping public perception in the face of violence.

As this unsettling event unfolded, it quickly drew comparisons to notable episodes from the past, where tensions erupted in similarly chaotic circumstances—provoking both fear and fascination. The image of individuals being lit on fire starkly contrasts with a nostalgic sentiment for a time when bystanders would instinctively intervene to protect individuals in distress. Such memories evoke a longing for a society that prioritizes human decency and collective safety. Today, however, it seems as though the inclination has morphed into a tendency for spectators to capture the moments on their devices, prioritizing the pursuit of viral content over acts of altruism.

This latest act of brutality raises essential questions about the psyche behind premeditated violence. The involvement of materials often associated with creating a Molotov cocktail suggests a deliberate intent that goes beyond mere impulsive aggression. Such preparation for violence signifies a disturbing trend that challenges community cohesion and public safety.

In light of this traumatic incident, a call to action resonates strongly within the community and beyond. It urges society to step back from the allure of sensationalism inherent in viral culture and instead foster a more compassionate environment towards one another. People are being reminded that safety should be a priority, advocating for a return to the days when individuals felt responsible for intervening in moments of peril.

As this narrative continues to unfold, it serves as a stark reminder that urgent conversations are needed around public safety, community responsibility, and the societal implications of our current attitudes toward violence.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Need for a border wall emphasized, citing security beyond just preventing illegal immigration.

In the ongoing debate over national security, the pressing need for a border wall has been underscored by recent events in Luna County, New Mexico. Law enforcement has been placed on high alert following a traffic stop involving an undocumented woman from the Middle East. Described as an “Islamic refugee,” the woman was found to possess detailed plans for a remote gas pipeline in Deming, New Mexico, raising significant concerns about potential threats to U.S. homeland security.

The discovery of these plans has led to fears regarding what some suspect might be reconnaissance for future attacks. Although the investigation, conducted by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol, concluded without identifying any immediate threats, the incident has nonetheless sparked a heightened sense of vigilance among law enforcement and local communities.

Reports have emerged highlighting worries about the undocumented Muslim presence near the U.S.-Mexico border. Analysts are drawing attention to previous reports from Judicial Watch in 2015 and 2017, which indicated a troubling collaboration between Mexican cartels and international terrorist organizations. These findings have exacerbated calls for stronger border security measures, including suggestions for Congress to approve funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Advocates argue that such a structure would be vital in preventing infiltration by both terrorists and drug traffickers.

Currently, many individuals crossing the border illegally are not from Mexico, raising suspicions about their origins and potential ties to criminal elements. There is growing concern that some of these undocumented individuals may receive support from the Mexican government, facilitating their entry into the United States. As a result, experts are emphasizing the ease with which terrorists could potentially exploit the vulnerabilities of the southern border.

This unfolding situation in New Mexico has ignited renewed discussions about the necessity of a border wall, with proponents firmly asserting that its construction is integral to safeguarding the nation against foreign threats. In light of the incident involving the Middle Eastern woman and the subsequent investigation, the call for enhanced security measures along the border has never seemed more urgent. As national discussions continue, the message remains clear: bolstering border security is paramount to ensure the safety and well-being of the American public in a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape.",-44.0,-19.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,425.0,-1.2666666666666666,-0.04470588235294118

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

CNN has come under fire for perceived bias in its reporting and debate moderation, particularly during a recent debate where Lester Holt’s performance drew scrutiny. Critics argued that Holt displayed favoritism towards Hillary Clinton, consequently shaping public perception of the candidates.

Post-debate analysis by CNN revealed that 62% of respondents believed Clinton triumphed in the debate. However, this statistic raised concerns as only 26% of the surveyed individuals identified as Republicans. The poll featured a significant proportion of Independents at 33% and Democrats at 41%, suggesting a skewed sample may have influenced the results.

In contrast, an NBC poll mirrored these findings, indicating a disparity in party representation, with 14% more Democrats than Republicans participating.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a world where the spotlight often shines on personal gain and material success, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands as a beacon of hope, faith, and enduring service to others. An outspoken believer in his values, Wilson emphasizes his love for God as the cornerstone of his life and career. Throughout his journey as an athlete, he has been vocal about his desire to help others find joy while aiming to leave a lasting legacy that extends beyond the football field.

On game day, Wilson is laser-focused on winning, yet beyond the bounds of the gridiron, he is driven by a higher purpose. He actively promotes messages of hope, faith, and making good choices, highlighting his commitment to positive values. This conviction becomes even more significant considering that Wilson faced advice from the NFL that suggested he avoid public discussions about his faith. Instead of shying away from his beliefs, Wilson opted to let his actions speak volumes, demonstrating that true faith can manifest in how one lives and serves others.

For Wilson, the hierarchy of priorities is clear: God first, family and friends second, and football third. He firmly believes that adhering to this order cultivates an environment conducive to positivity and success, both personally and professionally. This commitment to his values also leads him to reflect on the habits of public figures who, in attaining success, often seem to abandon their core principles along the way. His critique targets the trend of losing sight of one’s values upon reaching prominent status, serving as a reminder that integrity should not be sacrificed for fame.

Wilson's concerns extend into broader societal reflection, particularly amidst the prevailing corruption and deception that seems to plague leadership in the current political landscape. As a public figure, he feels a responsibility to challenge this status quo, urging the need for honesty and accountability in leadership roles. His activism positions him as a voice of reason in a climate where misinformation and disillusionment run rampant.

The dialogue surrounding faith, respect, and national identity in America also warrants Wilson's scrutiny. He highlights a growing hypocrisy in societal norms that seemingly diminishes the importance of faith and genuineness regarding respect for the nation. Wilson questions why serving others and promoting happiness have transformed into subjects of criticism rather than acknowledgment. His inquiry into this cultural shift reveals a deeper concern: the values that once united communities are being overshadowed by negativity and cynicism.

The issues of truth and morality loom large in the current social discourse, and Wilson's perspective invites essential reflection on what it means to lead and inspire in times of uncertainty. By placing an emphasis on serving others, balancing life’s priorities, and living out his faith, he seeks to illuminate a path that prioritizes positivity over division.

In his steadfast dedication to these principles, Russell Wilson not only seeks to uplift his teammates and fans but also hopes to inspire a collective movement towards a more compassionate, empathetic society. His journey highlights that, regardless of one's status or success, the foundations of faith, integrity, and service can lead to profound change and a reaffirmation of shared human values. As Wilson continues to navigate the dualities of fame and belief, he remains a powerful figure advocating for a world where joy and kindness prevail over the dark undercurrents of societal challenges.",79.0,77.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,642.0,3.347826086956522,0.11993769470404984
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a powerful address to the press in Italy, Pope Francis expressed strong disapproval of fear-based journalism, controversially likening such practices to terrorism. His remarks underscore a growing concern about how certain media outlets perpetuate stereotypes and incite fear, particularly against vulnerable populations such as migrants.

The Pope's critique comes at a time when many news networks have been criticized for focusing on sensationalism rather than balanced reporting. During his address, Francis quoted Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who famously stated that ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" This historical reference was used to emphasize the detrimental impact that fear-mongering media can have on society.

Highlighting the immense responsibility that journalists carry, the Pope cautioned that words can wield significant power, noting, ""You can kill a person with your tongue."" This assertion speaks to the potential harm that irresponsible reporting can inflict, particularly in an era where misinformation can spread rapidly and incite real-world consequences.

While Pope Francis was speaking primarily to the Italian press, his message resonates beyond Italy’s borders, pointing to global issues in media practices, particularly in networks such as Fox News. The recent environment surrounding media reporting has raised alarms, especially given the rising concern among Americans about terrorism and crime. Despite crime rates in the United States being notably down, public anxiety remains at an all-time high, a phenomenon not seen in over a decade.

This heightened fear is closely tied to political rhetoric and narratives that have shaped public perception. Notably, figures like Donald Trump have played a significant role in escalating fear among the populace, often leveraging media platforms to amplify these sentiments. The interplay between politics and journalism can create an atmosphere of heightened concern, an issue the Pope aims to address through his feedback on media ethics.

Specifically, Fox News has been branded a ""fear network,"" with accusations that it effectively terrifies its audience amid the current political climate. Critics argue that such coverage contributes to misplaced fears and a distorted understanding of the reality surrounding crime and terrorism, diverting attention from the statistical safety evidenced by crime trends.

Pope Francis's address serves as a poignant reminder of the ethical obligations that come with journalistic power. In urging journalists to reconsider their approach and impact, he calls for a more responsible and compassionate media landscape, one that fosters understanding rather than fuel fear.",-56.0,-44.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,454.0,-2.588235294117647,-0.09691629955947137
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Debate topics that shaped the discourse included the controversial Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and the issue of Trump’s tax returns. Trump's performance has been met with mixed reactions, as he took to Twitter to express gratitude for the positive polling results from various sources. Nonetheless, questions have been raised regarding the integrity of CNN's polling, especially after the network acknowledged that its sample pool leaned more Democratic than Republican. This revelation has sparked discussions about potential bias influencing the outcome of their poll.

Despite CNN's assertion of Clinton's dominance in the debate, their poll also exhibited mixed results concerning its potential effect on voter turnout for her campaign, leaving analysts wondering about the long-term implications of the debate on the election landscape.

In the wake of the debate, Trump claimed he faced challenges with a defective microphone, which he suggested hampered his performance. He also lamented that he did not take the opportunity to mention Bill Clinton's past infidelities during discussions—a move that could have shifted the conversation in his favor.

As the election date draws closer, time is running out for both candidates to sway undecided voters. Additionally, Julian Assange has hinted at an ""October surprise"" that could adversely affect Clinton’s campaign, suggesting that more unexpected developments might await voters in the lead-up to the election. The contrasting results from polling organizations indicate a divided voter base, making the coming weeks critical as both sides prepare to intensify their efforts in courting public opinion.",18.0,10.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,371.0,0.7692307692307693,0.026954177897574125

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

Recent post-debate analyses indicate that Hillary Clinton emerged victorious against Donald Trump, according to focus groups conducted by leading news networks Fox News and CNN. In CNN's focus group, Clinton was reported to have won decisively with an 18-2 tally among voters from Florida. Similarly, a group surveyed by Fox News, led by political analyst Frank Luntz, found Clinton triumphed with a 16-6 outcome, with participants hailing from Pennsylvania.

While Clinton's performance garnered considerable support, Luntz highlighted some of the challenges Trump faced during the debate. He pointed out that Trump struggled to adequately address questions regarding his taxes, a topic that has plagued the candidate throughout his campaign. However, Luntz noted that Trump seemed to resonate better with the audience when discussing Clinton's email scandal, a point that has been a focal issue in the political narrative.

The debate also included Trump's controversial remarks regarding his questioning of former President Obama's birthplace, for which he faced significant backlash. This incident prompted a flurry of comments across social media platforms, complicating Trump's standing among voters.

Despite the positive reception for Clinton from certain focus groups, a contrasting poll suggested Trump as the victor with a staggering 92% to 8% margin. This discrepancy highlights the divided opinions among voters and observers regarding the two candidates' performances.

Following the debates, Clinton took to Twitter to proclaim her victory, which ignited a strong online backlash. The hashtag #TrumpWon began trending, signifying that many viewers perceived the debate outcome differently from the focus groups. Critics voiced their frustrations on social media, with some suggesting that Clinton had been avoiding the media and could no longer disregard the negative sentiments surfacing from her supporters and opponents alike.

Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

CHARLOTTE - Protests erupted anew in the heart of the city for the second consecutive night after the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, a 29-year-old man, igniting outrage and demands for accountability from community members. As demonstrators took to the streets, tensions soared following a shocking incident that left one civilian critically injured.

The protests began with an air of peaceful defiance, as attendees carried signs bearing messages such as ""Hands Up, Don’t Shoot."" The atmosphere, however, shifted dramatically when riot police were deployed to control the crowds. Eyewitness accounts have since cast doubt on the police narrative concerning a shooting incident that left one protester critically injured.

This evolving situation became even more treacherous when gunfire erupted, striking a civilian in the head. This critical injury raised alarms, prompting questions regarding the actions of law enforcement during the protests. Initial reports from police suggested that the gunfire came from a civilian in the crowd. However, not long after the incident, several eyewitnesses began to speak out, leading to a chorus of dissent regarding the official police statement.

Among the witnesses, Todd Zimmer took to Twitter to express his disbelief at the police stance. Zimmer accused the city officials of lying about the circumstances surrounding the injury, urging others to seek out the truth. His posts fueled the fire of skepticism that was rapidly growing among the protesters and community members.

Further insight into the incident was provided by Kahran Meyer, a defense lawyer who was also a key witness to the events of the night. Meyer stated in a public address that the sound of the gunfire did not resemble a typical firearm. His observations directly contradicted the initial police claim that a civilian, rather than an officer, had fired the shot. This revelation further complicated an already tumultuous situation, as the community sought clarity in a time rife with confusion and anger.

The narrative of police involvement gained more traction as numerous eyewitness reports emerged, indicating that the injured protester had, in fact, been shot by law enforcement. Minister Steve Knight, an eyewitness on the scene, corroborated these accounts, citing his own observations of police actions that night. Knight, along with others present, began to vocalize their disbelief at the disparity between the police narrative and the evidence presented by those who witnessed the events firsthand.

Critics of the police’s response to the protests have decried the state's violent actions as a continuing legacy of systemic oppression faced by communities of color. With events unfolding rapidly, demonstrators rallied together, using social media to share their experiences and mobilize support. The anger directed at law enforcement intensified as incidents like the shooting incident reframed the discussion around police brutality and accountability.

The persistence of protests over two consecutive nights highlights not only the immediate anger over Scott’s killing but also the broader context in which these tragedies occur. The historic patterns of distrust between police forces and the communities they serve were reignited, pushing the narrative of systemic oppression to the forefront of public discourse.

As Charlotte residents remain vocal amid this turmoil, community leaders, activists, and lawyers are calling for a thorough and transparent investigation into the police's handling of the situation. Demands for justice for Kenneth L. Scott and clarity surrounding the shooting incident underscore a collective yearning for change outside the confines of law enforcement narratives.

As night fell over the bustling streets of Charlotte, the crowd chanted slogans calling for justice, swaying between anger and a plea for peace. What began as a call for accountability after one man's tragic death has significantly morphed into a fight against a perceived pattern of oppression—an intersection of grieving, fighting for justice, and advocating for systemic reform.

Eyewitnesses and those present at the protests on both nights held steadfast in their commitment to uncovering the truth. The coalition of voices, including those like Zimmer, Meyer, and Knight, illustrate the urgent demand for justice reverberating through the community. They emphasized that public trust in local law enforcement is fragile and contingent on transparency, especially following traumatic events.

As the situation unfolds in Charlotte, local leaders and activists are preparing to continue their resolve. The power of public assembly, fortified by social media, has proven a significant force, bringing diverse groups together in solidarity against what they perceive as unjust treatment by the police.

In response to the growing outcry, city officials have stated their intention to revisit the protocols surrounding the use of force by law enforcement during public demonstrations, a commitment that many feel is long overdue. Advocates from various backgrounds are hopeful that this tragic incident will not be another statistic, but rather a pivotal moment leading to the long-awaited change in community-police relations.

As the community awaits answers regarding both the police's handling of Kenneth L. Scott’s death and the subsequent shooting incident, the cries for accountability from the streets of Charlotte will not quieten easily. The demand for justice rings across the city, as residents continue to gather in protest; the peaceful expressions of their outrage demand to be heard, and they are focused on the need for systemic change that honors the lives taken and supports the living in their quest for dignity and respect.

Moving forward, residents of Charlotte face the dual task of seeking accountability for Kenneth L. Scott's death and the allegations surrounding the protest injury. The resilience shown through the protests speaks volumes to a community united in grief and in call for justice, pushing back against what they argue is a history of systemic oppression rooted deeply within local law enforcement practices.

As the situation continues to evolve, demonstrators remain vigilant. Their perseverance through adversity, marked by collective voices insisting on accountability, speaks to a growing movement demanding change not only in Charlotte but throughout the nation. The struggles faced reflect a broader call for justice that transcends local boundaries—a fight for acknowledgment and reform that continues to resonate long after the protests fade.",-74.0,-62.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,1125.0,-1.4761904761904763,-0.05511111111111111
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential race heats up, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, finds himself mired in controversy surrounding his foreign policy stances, particularly regarding Russia. Accusations have surfaced suggesting that Trump’s political inclinations align closely with those of Vladimir Putin, raising alarm among political analysts and critics alike.

Trump’s connections to individuals with ties to the Kremlin and Russian oligarchs have come under intense scrutiny. An ABC News investigation has highlighted that Trump has numerous financial ties to Russian interests, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. These revelations prompt serious questions regarding the potential implications for U.S. foreign policy, especially if Trump were to regain the presidency.

One notable aspect of Trump’s dealings involves hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow, an endeavor that not only fortified his brand internationally but also established a significant connection with Russian elites. Furthermore, Trump has sold various properties to Russian buyers, an indication of his long-standing financial engagement with the country. This web of business dealings raises eyebrows, particularly given the nature of the Russian economy, where fortunes have been amassed by oligarchs during the transition from a Soviet regime to a free-market approach.

The Russian oligarchs, many of whom have faced scrutiny themselves due to their ties to Putin, exhibit a lifestyle focused on personal consumption. Their financial clout has been utilized notably through investments in Trump properties, aiding them in transferring wealth out of Russia. Such transactions illustrate the intertwined nature of Trump’s business interests and broader Russian economic patterns, leading to questions about loyalty and influence.

In 2014, the landscape changed dramatically with the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Russian oligarchs following the annexation of Crimea. The sanctions have significantly affected their financial maneuvers, hindering traditional money-laundering methods that previously allowed them to operate with relative impunity. Critics of Trump argue that if he were to ascend to the presidency once more, he could potentially lift these sanctions, creating a scenario that would disproportionately benefit both the oligarchs and himself.

Political analysts stress that the implications of Trump’s foreign policy could either directly or indirectly serve his financial interests, leading to a pronounced conflict of interest. The possibility of prioritizing personal financial gain over national concerns raises eyebrows on Capitol Hill and beyond. This perceived alignment has amplified concerns regarding whether Trump would uphold U.S. interests on the global stage.

The support Trump has received from Russian state-controlled media and intelligence further complicates this already contentious issue. These endorsements not only signal a favorable disposition towards Trump's policy orientation but also hint at a calculated effort to influence American politics from abroad. The Trump campaign's acknowledgment of and response to this assistance remains ambiguous, adding fuel to the partisan fire surrounding his candidacy.

Concerns regarding Trump's potential presidency are not solely about international relations. A broader narrative is emerging, calling into question the legitimacy of his leadership based on perceived self-interest. This dynamic further complicates his ability to act as a responsible steward of U.S. foreign policy, particularly in engagement with Russia.

Amidst these controversies, a rallying cry has emerged from various quarters urging Congress to consider impeachment proceedings against Trump. Proponents argue that such drastic measures are warranted to protect national integrity and to address the escalating concern regarding Trump's prioritization of personal over collective interests.

The interplay of Trump’s business dealings, Russian connections, and foreign policy stances presents a complex challenge for voters as they prepare to head to the polls in the coming months. The ramifications of electing a figure with such entangled ties to foreign interests could shift the U.S.'s geopolitical alignments and impact its foreign policy reliability.

As voters weigh their options, it remains to be seen whether the allegations levied against Trump will sway public opinion. The political landscape is fraught with divisions, and Trump's foreign policy record, intertwined with his financial interests, serves as an ongoing point of contention.

Ultimately, the question looms large: can a candidate who appears to place personal ambition above national interests be trusted with the highest office in the land? As the election date draws nearer, both supporters and detractors of Trump will continue to grapple with the implications of his extensive ties to Russian oligarchs, foreign policy approach, and the overarching conflict between personal gain and national duty.",27.0,17.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,816.0,0.5483870967741935,0.020833333333333332
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is under the looming shadow of possible impeachment as the fallout from the infamous ""Bridgegate"" scandal continues to unfold. The controversy centers on the deliberate closure of the George Washington Bridge, which authorities allege was orchestrated by Christie and his aides to retaliate against a political opponent.

Top state legislators in New Jersey are weighing the possibility of filing articles of impeachment against Christie should he be found guilty of coordinating the bridge closure as an act of political punishment. The situation has gained urgency, particularly following a federal judge's ruling that mandates the governor to produce personal emails connected to the scandal. These emails could potentially shed further light on Christie's involvement, as well as on the broader implications of the incident.

The decision to move forward with impeachment lies primarily with Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Vincent Prieto. If Prieto approves the motion, it kick-starts the process, allowing the Assembly Judiciary Committee to initiate proceedings against Christie. To advance the impeachment, a simple majority vote in the 80-member Democratic-controlled Assembly is essential. If the process advances, a daunting two-thirds majority in the state Senate would be required to secure a conviction.

Federal prosecutors are intensifying scrutiny on Christie, having linked him to a trial involving three of his senior aides who are facing charges related to the scandal. Testimonies in court have pointed to Christie being deeply entrenched in the alleged conspiracy, raising significant questions about his leadership and ethical conduct. The unauthorized lane closures on the George Washington Bridge resulted in immense traffic gridlock, which tragically has been tied to a reported death caused by delays in emergency services. This consequential outcome highlights the severe consequences of what some are calling a politically motivated act.

Adding to the chaos, recent revelations suggest that Christie had knowledge of the scandal's effects during a solemn 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013. Despite being informed at such a crucial moment, he reportedly took no definitive action to address the ongoing crisis. This has led to a further decline in his reputation, positioning Christie in an increasingly vulnerable state as he grapples with his political future.

Christie's profound fall from grace is starkly illustrated against his prior status as a prominent supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The scandal not only jeopardizes his governorship but has also raised persistent concerns regarding his viability in the political landscape, as both allies and opponents alike reassess their positions in light of these developments.

As the investigation and potential impeachment proceedings loom, many observers are closely monitoring the situation. Political analysts note that the unfolding events may not only impact Christie's governorship but could also generate wider implications for political accountability and governance in New Jersey.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a notable moment during the September 2015 Republican primary debate, Donald Trump made headlines by asserting that he never lobbied Jeb Bush for casino gambling. Trump’s statement implied that, had Bush genuinely wanted to grant casino gambling, he would have done so without any persuasion. This assertion is particularly troubling, as it raises serious questions about Trump’s credibility and the implications of his claims regarding his interactions with the former Florida governor.

Contradictory to Trump's assertions during the debate, Jeb Bush firmly refuted his claims, stating that Trump had indeed sought access to casino gambling in Florida. Bush asserted that Trump’s attempts were unsuccessful only because of Bush’s explicit opposition. This exchange highlights a deeper issue: the inconsistencies in Trump’s narrative and how it aligns with his past actions.

One of the significant points of contention revolves around the possibility that Trump may have committed perjury during a civil court deposition. In this deposition, Trump outright admitted to pursuing casino gambling in Florida, creating a stark contrast between his testimony and his debate claims. This contradiction raises the alarming prospect that Trump, in an effort to reshape his public image, may have been less than truthful under oath. The importance of honesty in such situations cannot be understated, particularly in light of historical precedents, such as the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, which was largely predicated on false statements made under oath.

Moreover, there’s an established pattern in Trump’s behavior of constructing false narratives as a defense mechanism against admitting failure. His statements during the debate appear to be just another manifestation of this tendency. By denying that he lobbied for casino gambling, Trump attempts to deflect responsibility for his actions and failed pursuits. This modus operandi suggests an avoidance of accountability that has characterized much of his public persona.

Taking into account Trump’s documented efforts to persuade Jeb Bush regarding casino gambling, one can observe a troubling narrative emerging. In a deposition from 2007, Trump detailed his attempts to lobby Bush for a favorable stance on casino gambling, directly contradicting his claims made years later during the debate. This pattern of behavior not only questions Trump’s credibility but also indicates a troubling lack of responsibility for his own actions—a theme that resonates with many voters seeking integrity and transparency from their leaders.

The implications of such contradictions extend beyond personal integrity; they bear weight on national safety. A leader’s credibility is critical when dealing with both domestic and international matters. Voters must consider whether they can trust a candidate whose statements are inconsistent and whose accountability is questionable. The integrity of Trump's candidacy stands in jeopardy, jeopardizing not just his political aspirations but also the trust that the electorate places in public figures.

As calls for accountability grow, some advocates are urging the public to take action against Trump for perceived wrongdoing. The advocacy for impeachment, while still a topic of debate among political peers, centers around the notion that failing to hold leaders accountable for their actions sets a dangerous precedent for the nation's political landscape. If past presidents have faced consequences for misleading statements, one must ponder the implications of allowing such behavior to persist without repercussions today.

Ultimately, the claims made by Trump and the rebuttals provided by Bush have opened up a broader conversation about accountability, truthfulness, and the responsibilities held by those in public office. As the nation moves deeper into a polarized political climate, it becomes ever more crucial for constituents to critically evaluate the credibility of their candidates. The emergence of conflicting narratives not only undermines individual candidates but also threatens the foundational principles upon which trust in government is built.

As this situation unfolds, observers are left to navigate the murky waters of political discourse and the credibility of their leaders. It becomes imperative for voters to engage with these issues actively; awareness of candidates’ integrity and accountability should be at the forefront of electoral considerations. The importance of honesty in political discourse cannot be overstressed, as it plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and policy.

In the fast-paced world of politics, where narratives can change in an instant, the need for a grounded and truthful approach to leadership has never been more evident. As this issue continues to develop, the public is encouraged to stay vigilant, press for transparency, and demand accountability from those who aspire to lead. The discussions spurred by Trump’s casino claims serve not merely as commentary on his personal narrative but as a pivotal examination of the broader implications of truthfulness in politics and governance.

In conclusion, the intersection of Trump’s statements concerning his lobbying efforts and the responses provided by Jeb Bush raises substantial questions about personal accountability and integrity in leadership. The allegations surrounding potential perjury, combined with a legacy of creating narratives that frequently evade responsibility, call into question the foundational trust that a democracy relies upon. As citizens, the call for introspection and engagement with these matters is essential, emphasizing the non-negotiable need for honesty and accountability in the realm of public service—ensuring that future leaders uphold the values that the nation cherishes.",-29.0,-20.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,984.0,-0.5555555555555556,-0.02032520325203252
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a drinking game during a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN.

As viewers flock to engage in drinking games during televised debates, a stern warning has been issued by U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. Many participants took to a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN, where they were encouraged to drink whenever Donald Trump made a false statement. However, Murthy cautioned that such practices could pose serious health risks, potentially leading to alcohol poisoning.

Historically, drinking games associated with political debates have raised alarms. In a previous warning issued last year, Murthy expressed concern about the dangers of these games, particularly due to the problematic statements made by candidates. This year, his concerns are echoed once more, especially considering the high stakes involved and the penchant for exaggeration among political figures.

The issue is not merely theoretical; in 2012, there were approximately 70,000 instances of alcohol poisoning related to debate-themed drinking games, which underscores the potential dangers of excessive consumption during such high-tension events. Ahead of the first presidential debate in September 2016, between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Murthy reiterated his warnings, emphasizing the need for caution given Trump's track record of dishonesty.

In light of recent events, it was noted that Trump told 87 lies in a mere five-day period leading up to that debate—an average of a lie every three minutes and 15 seconds. Due to this pattern, analysts estimated that Trump could have lied about 28 times during the recent CNN debate, suggesting that viewers participating in a drinking game could find themselves in precarious situations.

In anticipation of these potentially hazardous drinking games, first-responders have been alerted and are preparing for possible alcohol-related incidents following the debate. Murthy's warnings serve as a reminder for viewers to be mindful of their drinking habits as they engage in the fun of these games. 

As the political arena heats up leading into upcoming debates, Murthy encourages viewers to consume alcohol responsibly. In an age where political discourse makes for not only heated exchanges but also trending party games, moderation is key to ensuring the safety and well-being of all participants.",-17.0,-3.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,394.0,-0.2,-0.007614213197969543
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In a recent debate, Hillary Clinton was widely declared the winner by mainstream media outlets, buoyed by applause in traditional political circles. However, a stark contrast emerged on social media platforms where online polls and Twitter trends indicated a different narrative, with the hashtag #TrumpWon rapidly gaining traction.

The rise of the #TrumpWon hashtag has drawn attention to its curious origins, traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. This revelation has raised eyebrows, given the ongoing concerns about foreign influence in American elections. Observers noted that this trend aligned with long-standing tactics employed by Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who has been known to engage cyber-trolls to advance his disinformation agenda.

Putin’s strategy appears designed to sow discord within American society by amplifying divisions across social media platforms. Both the support for Trump and the accompanying disinformation campaigns serve to further Putin's interests, particularly his efforts to manipulate U.S. foreign policy regarding sanctions and oversight of Russian military actions in Eastern Europe.

In an alarming description of life within these Russian troll farms, ex-bloggers have recounted their experiences working under harsh and tightly controlled conditions that resemble an internet sweatshop. Such accounts reveal the potential for manipulation and control that exists within the digital sphere, where genuine user sentiment can be overshadowed by orchestrated campaigns.

Given this context, audience members are urged to exercise caution regarding the reliability of online polls and comments sections. The overwhelming influence of foreign entities presents a serious challenge, with motives that extend beyond mere political commentary to the heart of American democracy.

The debate surrounding Trump and Clinton ultimately leads to a more significant conversation about the integrity of political discourse in the United States. In light of these developments, a call to action has emerged, advocating for citizens to actively demand the impeachment of Donald Trump. As foreign influence continues to encroach upon American politics, the public’s engagement and vigilance may prove crucial in safeguarding the democratic process.

While mainstream media narratives may depict the debate results in one light, the swelling online dissent and its complex influences highlight deeper struggles within American political dialogue. Individuals are encouraged to remain informed and question the veracity of trends that may not reflect genuine public sentiment, but rather a calculated effort to manipulate opinions under the guise of free speech.",-9.0,15.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,440.0,0.9375,0.03409090909090909
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a company co-founded by tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, is facing a significant legal challenge. The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Palantir systematically discriminates against Asian applicants during its hiring process, raising questions about the company’s commitment to nondiscriminatory practices in a landscape where diversity is increasingly at the forefront of corporate responsibility.

The allegations come to light amid scrutiny of Palantir’s hiring statistics for engineering interns. Data indicate that while a substantial 73% of applicants for these positions identified as Asian, the hiring outcomes were notably disproportionate. Only four Asian candidates secured positions, contrasted against 17 non-Asian hires. This stark disparity has led the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to take action, emphasizing the imperative for federal contractors to adhere to fair and equitable hiring practices.

In response to the lawsuit, Palantir intends to mount a defense against the allegations of discrimination, asserting its commitment to ensure a fair hiring process. The outcome of this legal battle may hold significant implications not only for the company but also for the broader tech industry, where diversity and inclusion continue to be critical discussions.

Peter Thiel’s profile adds another layer of complexity to this situation. As a first-generation immigrant, Thiel’s support for certain political candidates who oppose immigration has raised eyebrows. Notably, former President Donald Trump is reportedly seeking to nominate Thiel to the Supreme Court, a claim that has been denied by both Thiel and Trump’s campaign. Thiel’s overt engagement with these political dynamics, particularly given his immigrant background, complicates the narrative surrounding the lawsuit and public perception of his leadership at Palantir.

Thiel is recognized not only for his role at Palantir but also as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook. His influence extends beyond mere business ventures; he has gained public and media attention for his controversial actions, including funding Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker, which resulted in the media company’s bankruptcy. This episode revealed Thiel's willingness to engage in legal battles that foreground his beliefs and align with his interests.

Adding to his public persona, Thiel made history as the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention. During his speech, he championed his identity while critiquing government inefficiency, thus positioning himself as a unique voice within a party often criticized for its regressive stance on LGBTQ+ issues. The contrast between Thiel’s personal narrative and the GOP’s broader anti-LGBTQ+ platform has drawn both admiration and criticism from various quarters, highlighting the complex web of identity and politics at play in his life.

As Palantir prepares to defend itself against the discrimination allegations, the implications of the lawsuit may extend beyond the company itself. It speaks to a broader narrative concerning fairness in hiring practices, particularly in industries where diversity remains an essential goal. The Department of Labor, through its OFCCP Director, has underscored the necessity of upholding non-discriminatory hiring practices among federal contractors, signaling a potential shift towards more rigorous enforcement of compliance.

The outcome of this lawsuit could play a pivotal role in shaping the conversation around employment practices in the tech industry and influence the public's trust in companies like Palantir. As the legal proceedings unfold, various stakeholders will be watching closely to see how Palantir responds to the serious allegations of employment discrimination and whether it reinforces or reevaluates its hiring protocols in light of these claims.",-18.0,1.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,660.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0015151515151515152

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

New York City is grappling with the aftermath of a disturbing bombing incident that unfolded in the Chelsea neighborhood, resulting in injuries to 29 individuals. As investigators delve deeper into the case, troubling connections have emerged, sparking fears that the violence may be linked to Muslim extremists.

On the evening of September 17, a pressure-cooker bomb exploded in Chelsea, causing chaos and alarm in one of New York's bustling districts. The aftermath left the city on high alert, but the situation escalated when a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered shortly afterward in a nearby Dumpster, raising fears that this could be part of a larger threat.

Key investigation leads are painting a chilling picture as authorities work tirelessly to piece together the events leading up to the explosion. Among the critical findings is a hand-written letter, partially written in Arabic, that was found accompanying the second explosive device. Investigators are analyzing the contents of this letter closely to determine its implications in the broader scope of the investigation.

Adding to the unsettling developments, a male caller, whose identity remains unknown, phoned in a warning shortly after the Chelsea bombing. During the call, he ominously stated, “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.” This chilling statement has raised significant concerns regarding potential future threats, prompting law enforcement to ramp up their efforts in securing the area and investigating any connections to the bombing.

Compounding the already alarming situation is the emergence of a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber.’ This page, which appears to be a manifesto from the alleged bomber, claims responsibility for the Chelsea incident while expressing grievances related to societal oppression, LGBTQ+ issues, and racial inequality. The author articulates a desire to wage continued acts of terror as a misguided form of protest against these perceived injustices.

However, despite the explicit claims made in the Tumblr page, the authenticity of these assertions is being scrutinized. Experts and investigators have voiced concerns that such acts of violence could be exploited for personal recognition rather than genuine ideological motivations. The potential for individuals to latch onto high-profile acts of terror to gain notoriety complicates the investigation as authorities strive to discern the truth behind these claims.

As investigators sift through the evidence and follow leads, the residents of New York City are left rattled by the implications of these developments. The combination of a pressure-cooker bomb, the troubling letters, the ominous phone warning, and the precarious online manifesto presents a complex situation that demands urgent attention and thorough analysis.

As the investigation unfolds, authorities continue to encourage the public to remain vigilant while also reminding them of the importance of reporting any suspicious activities or individuals. Community leaders and law enforcement officials are collaborating to ensure that the public feels safe during this period of uncertainty.

The Chelsea bombing and its subsequent discoveries highlight the ongoing challenges posed by extremism and the influence of social media in shaping narratives around acts of violence. As New York City takes the necessary steps to bolster its security measures, the residents are reminded of the resilience that characterizes the spirit of the city, even in the face of adversity. 

As authorities seek to uncover the motivations and identities behind these leads, the community watches closely, hoping for justice and clarity in a time marked by fear and uncertainty.",-25.0,-33.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,632.0,-1.5,-0.05221518987341772
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As Donald Trump intensifies his campaign efforts, concerns about his mental fitness have surfaced, particularly in light of his upcoming debate with Hillary Clinton. At the age of 70, Trump has been relentlessly active on the campaign trail, seemingly sacrificing rest and downtime for the sake of engagement.

The alarm bells were rung less than 24 hours before the pivotal debate when Trump took to Twitter to share a baffling message. In his tweet, the former president conflated a range of unrelated topics, creating an impression of confusion that has raised eyebrows among political observers. Notably, he referenced a recent shooting incident in Washington State involving a Middle Eastern immigrant, alongside comments on drug overdose deaths in Ohio and riots in North Carolina.

This eclectic mix of subjects in a single tweet has prompted speculation about Trump's mental acuity. Critics argue that such disjointed thoughts and illogical associations could be indicative of mental strain, potentially impairing his ability to communicate effectively during the upcoming debate. As the stakes grow higher, the implications of his mental state become more pressing, with analysts questioning his preparedness to face off against Clinton.

The debate represents a critical moment in Trump's campaign, where effective articulation of policies and coherent arguments are vital for securing voter support. Detractors worry that his recent erratic behavior may not only hinder his performance but could also inflict damage on his campaign's momentum.

As Trump's campaign continues to draw national attention, the focus now turns to how he will manage the pressure of the debate stage. With lingering questions about his mental fitness swirling amidst the fervor of the campaign trail, the 2024 electoral landscape could heavily depend on his ability to maintain composure and clarity in the days to come.

In a campaign saturated with high stakes and intense scrutiny, Trump's recent actions may underscore deeper issues that could resonate far beyond the debate hall. As he prepares for his showdown with Clinton, the efficacy of his messaging and mental composure remains at the forefront of discussions, with many crossing their fingers for a coherent performance amidst growing concerns.",-22.0,-5.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,402.0,-0.35714285714285715,-0.012437810945273632

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio – In a troubling reflection of enthusiasm for her campaign, Hillary Clinton's recent door-knocking event in Delaware drew no attendees, aside from a solitary Donald Trump supporter who documented the lack of participation. The incident, which unfolded this past weekend, has left campaign staff and analysts expressing concern regarding Clinton's grassroots support and overall campaign viability as the election approaches.

Upon arrival, the Trump supporter visibly noted the absence of any Clinton volunteers, a situation that quickly led to a confrontation with campaign staff. Realizing who he was, Clinton's team asked him to leave, underscoring the heightened sensitivity surrounding the event amid a notable lack of engagement.

Despite expectations for a strong turnout, the campaign office was reportedly well-organized and equipped with supplies and materials necessary for extensive outreach efforts. Staff members had anticipated enthusiastic participation that would effectively convey Clinton's messages and initiatives to potential voters. However, the reality proved starkly different, leaving Clinton's team disappointed and raising questions about the campaign's ability to mobilize supporters.

The event served as a stark contrast to the packed rallies often hosted by Trump, where fervent crowds have expressed their backing for the former president. Comparisons between the two events highlight a significant disparity in perceived enthusiasm, revealing a troubling gap for Clinton's campaign, which is desperately in need of energized supporters as it heads into the critical final stretch before the upcoming election.

Experts suggest that the striking difference in attendance is indicative of a larger issue: Clinton's ability to resonate with voters. The absence of volunteers at the door-knocking event, coupled with the presence of a lone Trump supporter, raises serious concerns about the strength of Clinton's campaign ground game in Ohio and potentially in other swing states as well. 

As the political landscape continues to evolve, analysts are apprehensive that the current trajectory of Clinton's support may hamper her competitiveness against Trump in the 2024 election. With voter enthusiasm often serving as a bellwether for electoral success, the disappointing outcome of the Delaware event may signal deeper challenges ahead for the Clinton campaign. 

In a race that could hinge on turnout and grassroots support, the event's low participation has led political commentators to speculate about Clinton's path forward. The demonstrated lack of enthusiasm not only poses questions about her campaign's effectiveness but also highlights the necessity for a strategic reassessment as the election looms closer.

As both camps prepare for the challenges of the coming months, the stark contrast in engagement levels may present an uphill battle for Clinton. The Trump supporter’s documentation of the event serves as a reminder of the work still needed to rally support and mobilize volunteers, especially in battleground states like Ohio.

Clinton's campaign will need to address the evident lack of enthusiasm if it hopes to reshape the narrative and inspire supporters to step forward in greater numbers. With Trump's rallies consistently attracting throngs of supporters, Clinton's campaign must take action to invigorate her base and create a palpable momentum that could translate into votes on Election Day. As the race intensifies, the ability to convert enthusiasm into verifiable support will be critical for both candidates vying for the presidency in 2024.",-7.0,32.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,609.0,1.6,0.052545155993431854

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

A recent bombing in New York City has ignited national concern, bringing the issue of public safety and national security to the forefront of discourse. The incident has drawn immediate reactions from political figures, with former President Donald Trump being particularly vocal.

Trump wasted no time in referring to the incident as a ""bombing,"" a statement that quickly garnered attention across various media outlets. However, in a surprising twist, prominent news network CNN criticized Trump for his choice of words, even though Hillary Clinton had used the same term during her own commentary on the matter. This apparent double standard sparked further debate over media integrity and bias.

In an unexpected move, CNN edited its footage to remove Clinton's mention of ""bombing,"" a decision that did not go unnoticed by Trump. He responded to the network's actions by labeling CNN as “disgusting and disgraceful,” expressing outrage over their perceived dishonesty. Trump further condemned the network by dubbing it the ""Clinton news network,"" suggesting a connection between CNN's coverage and political interests favoring Clinton.

Trump's response to the bombing incident extended beyond media criticism. He emphasized that he was correct in labeling the attack as a bombing and condemned CNN for their decision to edit Clinton’s remarks. He leveraged this moment to urge a stronger stance on terrorism, pointing to what he described as ""stupid"" leadership among current authorities who maintain a soft approach to national security issues.

The former president articulated his belief that the United States needs to adopt a tougher stance on security matters, specifically regarding immigration policies. He expressed his concern over the ongoing influx of individuals from regions that pose potential threats to public safety. Drawing attention to President Obama’s plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees, Trump criticized the proposal, claiming that such numbers would only increase under Clinton's administration.

Trump raised alarms about the vetting process for individuals entering the U.S., arguing that many cannot be properly screened for security risks. This argument has become a cornerstone of Trump's broader narrative advocating for rigorous immigration controls and a re-evaluation of how the U.S. approaches refugee admissions.

The bombing incident in New York City not only raises questions about the state of national security but also ignites a heated debate over media representation and accountability. The differences in coverage and response to similar statements by political figures underscore the complexity of contemporary political communication.

As the nation grapples with the ramifications of this bombing, the dialogue surrounding security and media credibility is likely to intensify. For many, the call for a unified and robust approach to terrorism will remain a pressing issue, while controversy over media bias continues to simmer in the backdrop. 

The New York City bombing has spurred a wave of political rhetoric, with Trump at the center, using the incident as a platform for his critiques on current immigration policies and media practices. The implications of such discussions remind us of the intersection between real-world events and the powerful narratives crafted around them, shaping public perception and political discourse in the process. 

In a time when national security remains a top priority for citizens, the need for transparent and honest dialogue is essential. Whether through the media or political representations, the call for effective solutions to challenges posed by terrorism is paramount for the collective well-being of the nation. As more details about the bombing unfold, the American public will undoubtedly remain attentive to how their leaders respond in times of crisis.",-45.0,1.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,670.0,0.04,0.0014925373134328358

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

In a notable legal development, Ahmad Rahami, a convicted terrorist and murderer, has initiated a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey, citing claims of discrimination based on his family's cultural background and religion. Rahami, age 28, along with his father, Mohammad Sr., 53, and brother Mohammad, have alleged a pattern of harassment directed towards their family, particularly in relation to their family-owned chicken restaurant, which has been serving the community since 2002.

The Rahami family contends that they have endured significant discrimination, alleging that local officials have subjected them to undue scrutiny and harassment. The lawsuit outlines a series of tickets and court summons issued against the family, which they assert are baseless and represent an ongoing campaign of harassment stemming from racial bias. This claim is reinforced by the family's assertion that they have faced unfair treatment regarding their business operations.

According to the lawsuit, the Rahamis have been subjected to inconsistent regulations concerning their business hours. Despite being operationally allowed to remain open past 10 PM, local residents and police have allegedly maintained that the family was in violation of business hour regulations. This inconsistency raises concerns about potential prejuidice against the family, as they believe their treatment is in sharp contrast to that experienced by other local businesses.

The lawsuit also highlights the family's assertion that the Elizabeth police department has been actively trying to force their restaurant to close earlier than permitted, further compounding their grievance. The department has purportedly justified these actions by citing concerns regarding crime in the area, an explanation that the family dismisses as discriminatory and unfounded.

This legal action comes in the wake of Ahmad Rahami's infamous arrest in 2016 for bomb-related activities, which has led some observers to reflect on the intertwining of his later terrorist actions with the family's claims of victimization. The irony present in the contrast between the family's allegations of discrimination and Rahami's extremist behavior raises questions about societal perceptions and the complexities of addressing both individual actions and broader cultural biases.

The implications of the Rahami family's lawsuit extend beyond their personal experiences, potentially highlighting the significant societal issues surrounding race, religion, and civil rights in law enforcement practices. This case could serve as a precedent in understanding the responsibilities and accountability of local authorities when engaging with minority communities.

As proceedings continue, the Rahami family’s legal battle underscores a critical discourse surrounding discrimination, harassment, and the complex interactions between local law enforcement and diverse cultural backgrounds in New Jersey. The outcome of this lawsuit may resonate well beyond the courtroom, impacting public perceptions of justice and equality in the realm of law enforcement.",-49.0,-47.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,515.0,-2.9375,-0.0912621359223301
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Allegations have surfaced regarding potential pay-to-play corruption involving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the integrity of the foundation’s operations. In response to these accusations, the Clinton campaign emphasized the foundation's positive contributions to various charitable causes, attempting to disassociate the organization from the allegations being circulated.

Critics of the foundation, however, contend that it functions primarily as a profit-making enterprise for the Clinton family and their associates. This assertion is bolstered by financial data that indicates a significant discrepancy between the foundation's massive budget and its charitable disbursements. According to a report by the Daily Caller, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget in 2014 was allocated to charitable grants. Specifically, out of a nearly $91.3 million budget, less than $5.2 million was directed toward grants that would impact social causes.

In stark contrast to its charitable spending, the Clinton Foundation's operational costs tell a different story. In 2014, the foundation expended $34.8 million on salaries and benefits, alongside an astonishing $50.4 million categorized under ""other expenses."" Despite a marked increase of $30 million in overall funding for that year, charitable giving fell by 40% compared to the previous year, highlighting a troubling trend in the foundation's financial priorities.

Furthermore, there was a notable rise in the financial compensation provided to employees, as salaries and benefits surged by $5 million in 2014 alone. This information suggests an alignment between the foundation’s increasing expenses and the interests of its inner circle rather than the altruistic objectives it professes to espouse.

These revelations lead to an unsettling conclusion: the Clinton Foundation may primarily serve as a vehicle for the Clintons to enhance their wealth through political connections rather than as a genuine philanthropic endeavor. The implications of these allegations resonate deeply, particularly in a political landscape where transparency and ethical considerations are paramount. 

Regardless of the foundation's purported good works, the financial metrics raise critical questions about its operational integrity. While the Clinton campaign maintains that the foundation's impact is significant and positive, the disparities in its spending practices have ignited a broader conversation surrounding transparency, accountability, and potential conflicts of interest.

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

Former President Barack Obama delivered a speech in New York on Saturday that has left many Americans bewildered and critical, following a series of violent incidents in the country. The speech came in the wake of bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing in St. Cloud, Minnesota, events that collectively had the nation on high alert.

Instead of addressing these shocking occurrences directly, Obama chose to focus on the role of sexism in the media and to criticize former President Donald Trump while voicing his support for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. This decision has sparked significant backlash, with many observers expressing disappointment that the former leader failed to extend a message of solidarity or compassion in a time of crisis.

Critics have characterized Obama's response as not only tone-deaf but also arrogant. In the face of terror incidents that had sent shockwaves through the public, they expected a recognition of the events and an expression of sympathy for the victims and their families. This reaction underscores the expectation that leaders should acknowledge significant national tragedies and extend their support, particularly when individuals have lost their lives or have been injured in violent acts.

Obama's choice to neglect any mention of the bombings during his speech has raised eyebrows, especially given the high profile of the incidents. According to onlookers, a simple acknowledgment of the attacks and a comforting message to the victims could have been offered, even without comprehensive details about how the events unfolded. Such gestures are often seen as fundamental responsibilities of public figures, particularly those who once held the highest office in the land.

The former president instead opted to participate in a high-dollar fundraiser, which many critics argue signaled his priorities. This decision, particularly juxtaposed with the timing of the attacks, only stoked anger from those who believe that he should have devoted time to addressing the nation’s current climate of fear and uncertainty.

In the wake of Obama's speech, conversations have emerged surrounding the role of public figures in discussing national tragedies. Observers argue that speeches delivered by leaders are often an opportunity to unify a nation and provide comfort during times of distress. Most citizens look for reassurance and a sense of shared grief during such events, an expectation that was seemingly unmet by the speech delivered by Obama.

As the debates over the speech continue, the former president's remarks on sexism in media and his criticism of the current political landscape have overshadowed a crucial moment for national solidarity. Instead of rallying the public in response to recent violence, Obama has been seen by some as diverting attention away from pressing national issues. 

The fallout from the speech highlights how delicate the balance is for leaders when addressing their constituents. Many Americans find hope in the words of those they admire during periods of crisis, and when those words fall short, it can lead to disappointment and discontent. The mixed responses to Obama's New York address reflect a growing divide in expectations for political discourse and the responsibilities of those in positions of power.

As the nation continues to grapple with the aftermath of violence and political tensions, the responses to Obama's speech will likely be a topic of discussion among constituents and critics alike, serving as a reminder of the weight that public addresses carry in the hearts and minds of a grieving public.",-25.0,-38.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,634.0,-1.7272727272727273,-0.05993690851735016
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

Awareness of potential corruption within the Clinton Foundation has risen sharply among the American public, as new reports shed light on troubling issues facing one of its key initiatives. The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) has come under fire for allegedly distributing diluted HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa, raising significant concerns about the health and safety of patients reliant on these treatments.

A draft congressional report indicates that this practice of distributing adulterated drugs may have increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among affected individuals. CHAI is widely regarded as one of the Clinton Foundation's most significant and recognizable programs, making these allegations particularly damaging amid heightened scrutiny.

The report also draws attention to connections between former President Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-American figures who are currently being investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, the Clinton Foundation reportedly promoted Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company known for its history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting practices.

While the extent of the issue remains unclear, it is worrying that potentially numerous AIDS patients may have received the “watered-down” drugs. These allegations could lead to renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, especially as Hillary Clinton embarks on her presidential campaign.

As the public becomes increasingly aware of these troubling revelations, calls have emerged for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation, emphasizing the necessity for accountability and transparency, particularly regarding its impact on global health initiatives. The situation underscores the critical intersection of philanthropy and public trust, leaving many to question the integrity of organizations that operate on a global scale.

The foundation's response to these allegations, along with the forthcoming congressional report, will be pivotal in shaping public perception and the future of its numerous initiatives aimed at battling global health crises.",-14.0,-25.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,348.0,-2.272727272727273,-0.07183908045977011
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is facing significant criticism over newly enacted laws that critics argue are poorly worded and could lead to unintended legal consequences for parents. Recent legislation has introduced severe criminal penalties that put ordinary parenting activities under scrutiny, creating a potential minefield for caregivers.

One of the most controversial aspects of the law involves the criminalization of any contact between an adult and a child's genitals. As a result, activities that are typically viewed as normal, such as diaper changing or bathing an infant, could lead to parents being classified as felons. This provision has ignited a heated debate about the law's implications, particularly given its stated intent to protect children from molesters. Critics contend that, rather than safeguarding children, the law may inadvertently endanger parents who are simply fulfilling their caregiving duties.

The Arizona Supreme Court recently issued a ruling that further complicates the legal landscape for parents. The court determined that defendants under this law must prove a lack of sexual intent, which some legal experts argue undermines the foundational principle of ""innocent until proven guilty."" This shift in the burden of proof raises alarm bells among advocates for parental rights, who worry that it sets a dangerous precedent for how similar cases might be handled in the future.

Legal expert John Pfaff has weighed in on the situation, noting that the realities of plea bargaining may pressure parents into accepting guilty pleas for fear of facing harsh penalties that they might not be able to contest successfully. This underscores the precarious position parents find themselves in when navigating the complexities of an evolving legal framework that many feel is stacked against them.

Moreover, concerns have been voiced about the potential for child molestation laws to be weaponized by prosecutors. Critics warn that this could lead to prosecutorial harassment, thereby jeopardizing the constitutional rights of residents in Arizona. With the current climate surrounding these laws, parents and caregivers are left to contend with the specter of legal repercussions stemming from innocent actions.

The suspension of due process for parents within this legal context has also become a prominent point of concern. Many believe that the current legislature has not adequately accounted for the implications of these laws on everyday parenting, leading to widespread skepticism regarding the government's ability to implement fair and accurate legal safeguards.

As this issue continues to evolve, there is a growing call for the Arizona legislature to take a step back and reassess the language and intent of the laws that have been put in place. Advocates are urging lawmakers to revise the legislation to prevent future confusion and protect both children and parents from the potential for unjust accusations.

The ongoing fallout from these laws highlights a fraught intersection of child protection and parental rights, sparking a discourse about trust in government and the legal system as it pertains to family dynamics in Arizona. Critics stress that, as legislation evolves, the rights of innocent caregivers should never be infringed upon while striving to protect children.",-12.0,-30.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,560.0,-1.5,-0.05357142857142857

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts ahead of the next presidential campaign, speculation is mounting regarding the role Michelle Obama may play in a potential Hillary Clinton administration. While the possibilities of collaboration seem promising to some, not everyone is excited about the prospect of continued coverage of the Obamas influencing American political discourse. 

Critics have expressed discomfort with the idea of Michelle Obama becoming a key figure in a Clinton administration, primarily due to her legacy. Prominent among the criticisms is her school lunch program, which, while aimed at reducing childhood obesity, has faced backlash for its stringent regulations and perceived ineffectiveness in promoting nutrition. Detractors argue that the program replaced beloved staples with options that children often rejected. Coupled with previous controversial comments, critics suggest that Michelle Obama’s legacy may not resonate as positively in future policy discussions.

A more significant concern lies in the broader implications of government involvement in child-rearing—a sentiment echoed by both Clinton and Obama. The duo has suggested a model where government plays an influential role in educating families on child development and health. This concept has sparked debate about the adequacy and appropriateness of such interference, raising important questions about the limits of government involvement in what many view as a deeply personal aspect of life. 

Michelle Obama remains steadfast in her commitment to her healthy living campaign for children. With no plans to slow down, she aims to invigorate the ongoing discourse about health and wellness among the nation’s youth. Her dedication to this initiative showcases her desire for a lasting positive impact on future generations. However, her unwavering stance becomes problematic when viewed alongside this perceived need for government-guided parenting—an issue that has provoked division among both parents and policymakers.

The author of this discourse raises critical questions about Clinton’s motives behind wanting to involve the Obamas in her administration. A possible underlying strategy may be to appeal to a broader voter base by leveraging the popularity of Michelle Obama. This perspective suggests that tapping into the former First Lady’s appeal could be a calculated move to gain support, yet it also raises ethical considerations about the authenticity of such endorsements and directives.

Underlying these discussions is a palpable concern regarding the progressive influence over education and parenting norms. For many, the prospect of a government model that dictates child-rearing practices strikes at the heart of parental autonomy. Critics assert that the belief in government acting as a parental figure undermines the fundamental family unit and places undue pressure on institutions to dictate personal choices. 

The notion that government should play a role similar to that of a parent touches on the delicate balance between providing necessary support and infringing upon personal freedoms. It is a slippery slope that many argue could lead to unnecessary overreach into private lives. The emphasis on government intervention in what some consider basic parenting undermines the belief that families should primarily be responsible for their child’s upbringing.

In summation, while Michelle Obama’s potential involvement in a Hillary Clinton administration is sparking conversations across the political spectrum, the ramifications of such a partnership are deeply intertwined with concerns about government overreach, educational norms, and the essence of personal freedom in child-rearing. As discussions unfold, the future of these legacies remains at the forefront of political analysis and public sentiment in the United States.",6.0,28.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,627.0,1.1666666666666667,0.044657097288676235

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

Recent allegations have emerged involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and the distribution of what has been described as ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications across Africa. This troubling situation has raised significant concerns among health advocates, particularly regarding the safety and efficacy of treatments provided to vulnerable populations battling this deadly disease.

At the heart of these allegations is Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has come under intense scrutiny following claims that the drugs it supplied through CHAI were compromised. Reports indicate that these substandard medications may have contributed to increased morbidity and mortality among patients relying on them for HIV/AIDS treatment. This situation not only endangers lives but also challenges the efficacy of initiatives meant to combat a global health crisis.

In 2013, Ranbaxy was found guilty of fraud and for introducing adulterated drugs into the market, which culminated in a staggering $500 million penalty. This serious legal ruling casts a shadow over the company's practices and calls into question the integrity of the medications distributed through partnerships like that of CHAI. With such a history, many are left pondering whether the Clintons were aware of Ranbaxy’s questionable actions and what liability they might bear in this circumstance.

The situation has led to inquiries from lawmakers, including a noteworthy congressional report initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn. Blackburn's investigation specifically examines Hillary Clinton's relationship with Ranbaxy and its serious ramifications on AIDS patients across Africa. She has been particularly vocal about the need for a comprehensive inquiry to ascertain how many lives may have been lost or adversely affected due to the distribution of substandard treatments.

As the investigation unfolds, the ties between the Clinton Foundation and Ranbaxy are facing increased scrutiny. Observers point to the ongoing partnerships and financial support directed towards Ranbaxy despite known concerns regarding the company's quality control history. This perceived negligence regarding patient safety has led to mounting pressure on the Clinton Foundation, particularly as it seeks to position itself as a champion of global health initiatives.

Further complicating the narrative, in 2007, significant funding was allocated by the U.S. government to Ranbaxy to expand access to HIV/AIDS medications in developing regions. However, this allocation has raised alarms about the safety and efficacy of the drugs provided under such agreements. Critics argue that this situation has potentially accelerated patient decline, with reports indicating that many HIV-positive individuals may inadvertently be receiving ineffective treatments.

In light of these developments, questions abound regarding the reputational impact on the Clintons and their broader charitable efforts. The heart of the matter rests on numerous lives potentially at stake due to alleged corruption overshadowing their charitable mission. Observers worry that these allegations may hint at deeper systemic issues within their initiatives, suggesting that operational oversight may have inadequately prioritized patient wellbeing.

Advocates for public health are demanding accountability, emphasizing that organizations and individuals involved in humanitarian efforts must operate with the utmost transparency. As more details come to light regarding the practical implications of these compromised medications, the consequences for both the patients who rely on such treatments and the organizations providing them could be dire.

The Clinton Foundation’s continuing relationship with Ranbaxy, particularly in light of the ongoing controversies, poses significant challenges. With so many lives affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the expectation is clear: the quality and reliability of medications is paramount. As investigations proceed, it is critical that the health and safety of patients come first over financial or organizational interests.

As lawmakers and public health officials delve deeper into this situation, it remains vital that the findings be transparent and that accountability is prioritized. The public deserves to know how many lives may have been impacted due to the distribution of compromised medications and what measures are being taken to rectify the situation and prevent future occurrences.

The repercussions of this case extend beyond the immediate implications for the Clinton Health Access Initiative and Ranbaxy; they touch on broader questions of ethics, responsibility, and the effectiveness of philanthropic missions. As the narrative unfolds, it is evident that the stakes are high, not only for those involved in the allegations but, most importantly, for the countless individuals whose health outcomes depend on safe and effective medical treatments. The next phase will be watching how both the Clintons and Ranbaxy respond to these allegations and what steps they will take moving forward to ensure the integrity of public health initiatives is maintained.",-63.0,-23.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,823.0,-0.7666666666666667,-0.027946537059538274

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

A federal judge has mandated that the U.S. State Department release specific documents pertaining to the security training completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides within five days. The ruling was made by Judge Richard Leon, who sided with The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF) in the organization's ongoing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the State Department.

The case has drawn considerable attention, particularly as it centers on allegations concerning the handling of classified materials and secure communication practices by Clinton and her close associates, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. Judge Leon's ruling highlights a significant concern over government transparency and accountability regarding the maintenance of national security protocols.

During the proceedings, Judge Leon rejected the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, marking a pivotal win for TheDCNF. However, he also denied their request to depose State Department officials, a decision that left some observers questioning the broader implications for accountability within the department.

The State Department has been under scrutiny for failing to provide records that confirm whether Clinton and her aides received the mandatory annual security briefings necessary for handling classified materials. Specifically, these records are pertinent to understanding what security protocols were adhered to during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.

In expressing his dissatisfaction with the State Department's ongoing delays in document production, Judge Leon set specific deadlines for the release of the requested information. He ordered that one-third of the approximately 400 documents be made available by September 26, with the remaining documents to be released by October 10. This ruling aims to ensure timely access to information that has been the subject of prolonged debate and discussion.

The frustration of Judge Leon is echoed by TheDCNF, whose attorney criticized the State Department for what they described as continued obstruction. The attorney's remarks underscored the belief that the lack of responsiveness from the State Department raised questions about the agency's adherence to FOIA requests and its commitment to transparency regarding public officials' conduct.

Compounding the situation for the State Department, officials acknowledged in July that their inability to produce the requested documents suggested that the security courses required for Clinton and her aides were not completed. This admission raises significant concerns about the qualifications and preparedness of high-ranking officials entrusted with national security matters.

The release of these training documents could have far-reaching implications, particularly as public interest in the handling of classified information remains a pertinent topic in contemporary political discourse. Furthermore, the decision by Judge Leon may pave the way for greater scrutiny and oversight of the processes involved in managing sensitive information within the federal government.

As the October deadlines approach, all eyes will be on the State Department to see whether they comply with the judge's order or if further legal battles will ensue. The outcome will not only affect the individuals named in the lawsuit but could also set a precedent regarding the ability of organizations to access government records that may shed light on crucial issues of national security.

With ongoing discussions concerning government accountability and transparency, the actions taken by Judge Leon and TheDCNF signify a pivotal moment in the pursuit of information crucial to understanding the complexities of security training protocols for top government officials. The forthcoming release of the state documents will likely be scrutinized closely, as they may reveal insights into the actions taken—or not taken—by prominent figures in the government, including Clinton and her aides.

The pressure on the State Department to comply with the ruling underscores the importance of accountability in the public sector, particularly regarding national security matters. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of this ruling are likely to resonate for some time, influencing discussions about the accountability of government officials and their adherence to mandated security procedures.",-5.0,5.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,728.0,0.21739130434782608,0.006868131868131868
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton approaches, NBC News has hinted at a significant change in the format: moderator Lester Holt will not fact-check candidates during the event. This decision has sparked concerns about the implications for accountability and the integrity of the debate, particularly in light of Trump's consistent record of making unverified statements.

Without the presence of on-screen fact-checking, Trump may have the opportunity to make unaccountable claims, relying solely on Clinton to challenge his assertions. This dynamic places a heavy burden on Clinton, who not only must navigate Trump's rhetoric but also contend with the fact that all major cable networks—including Univision and Telemundo—have decided against providing real-time fact-checks. Many industry insiders argue that on-screen fact-checking could effectively highlight inaccuracies without disrupting the flow of the discussion, yet it appears that networks are prioritizing ratings over the essential accountability that such measures could provide.

Research shows that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, making the absence of a fact-checking mechanism a serious concern. The potential for misrepresentation during the debate raises questions about the democratic process and the voters’ ability to discern the truth. Clinton’s campaign has emphasized that the moderator's role is crucial in challenging lies, asserting that this is vital for ensuring a fair debate atmosphere. 

However, a troubling double standard may affect how voters perceive the two candidates. Clinton appears to be required to outperform Trump decisively, not just to win but to be regarded favorably by the electorate. This expectation exists despite the fact that she may lack the benefits of support from the moderator or favorable treatment from the media during the debate. As such, concerns are growing that without proper checks and balances in place, it will be difficult for voters to accurately assess Clinton’s performance against Trump.

The overall situation has prompted broader discussions about the integrity of journalism in the context of the election. The perceived decline in journalistic standards raises alarms not just for how this particular debate will unfold, but for the overall political landscape as well. Observers from various sides of the political spectrum note that the stakes have never been higher for the integrity of debates, and the absence of accountability could have lasting impacts on voter perception and engagement.

As the debate draws near, the lack of fact-checking mechanisms leaves critical questions unanswered and amplifies concerns regarding the integrity of the electoral process in a time when accurate information is more critical than ever.",-6.0,16.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,470.0,1.0,0.03404255319148936
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has publicly expressed alarming concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's capability to serve as president. In her recent remarks, Kyle, who is also the author of ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" claims that Clinton is driven by emotions that could jeopardize her physical and mental health.

Kyle's assertions center around what she describes as an overwhelming sense of anger and rage that Hillary Clinton reportedly exhibits. According to Kyle, these feelings could lead to severe physical breakdowns, casting doubt on Clinton's fitness for the presidency. ""Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,"" Kyle stated, emphasizing what she believes are signs of cognitive impairment and a decline in mental capabilities.

In her critique, Kyle points to evidence she perceives as indicators of emotional instability within Clinton, including memory loss and difficulty performing everyday tasks. These concerns amplify the narrative that Clinton's mental acuity may be waning, raising questions about her capability to handle the pressures of high office.

Additionally, Kyle describes Clinton as exhibiting traits of paranoia and a compulsive need to control situations, which she contends could lead to a psychological crisis. This characterization paints a troubling picture of Clinton's current state of mind, suggesting that such psychological strains could impede her ability to govern effectively.

Kyle further accuses Clinton of fostering an addiction to power, suggesting that her relentless ambition could be prioritized over both her health and the well-being of the Democratic Party. This notion raises broader implications regarding the motivations of political figures and their capacity to lead when personal aspirations overshadow public service.

These claims come at a time when Clinton has been struggling to maintain a positive public image amidst various health and character scandals. As discussions surrounding her potential political ambitions continue, Kyle's remarks contribute to an ongoing discourse regarding the former Secretary of State's readiness to take on the demands of leadership.

As the political landscape evolves, the impact of such criticisms on Clinton's public perception remains to be seen. With these concerns raised by a longtime associate, stakeholders within the Democratic Party may find themselves at a crossroads as they ponder the viability of Clinton returning to the political forefront.",-13.0,-13.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,431.0,-0.8666666666666667,-0.030162412993039442

FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In a time of increasing discussion surrounding immigration policies, a firm stance is emerging that emphasizes the need for immigrants to embrace American customs and traditions while respecting the identity of the ""United States of America."" This sentiment resonates with many who advocate for a cohesive cultural framework that prioritizes the values and heritage of the nation.

The conversation gained prominence when a Quebec mayor asserted that Muslim refugees seeking resettlement must ensure their integration into Canadian culture, rather than expecting to maintain their own cultural programs. His comments reflect a broader perspective that highlights the importance of cultural assimilation, particularly in nations like Canada and the United States.

The mayor articulated a view shared by many Canadians: while the nation welcomes a diverse range of immigrants, they will not sacrifice their long-standing identity and cultural values. This insistence on integration is seen as vital in preserving the nuanced fabric of Canadian society. He emphasized that personal faith and religious practices should remain private matters and confirmed that there would be no concessions to Islam or Sharia law within Canada’s legal framework. Such statements underscore a determination to keep national values at the forefront of immigration discussions.

Moreover, the mayor’s comments extended to advise Muslims who feel discomfort with Canadian culture to consider relocating to countries where their beliefs are better aligned with the prevailing societal norms. This perspective has ignited debate on the extent to which minority groups can influence the culture of the majority, suggesting that the relationship should not be one of negotiation or concession but rather one of mutual respect and adaptation.

In the United States, similar discussions are taking shape, with Texas now contemplating legislation aimed at preventing Sharia law from being implemented in the American legal system. This proposed measure underscores the belief that American laws and cultural practices should remain intact and that immigrants should adapt to these existing frameworks rather than imposing alternative legal systems.

The overarching message resonating through these discussions is encapsulated in the phrase ""integrate or vacate."" This philosophy advocates for a clear expectation that those seeking to become part of the American or Canadian fabric must engage with and adopt the prevailing cultural norms without expecting those norms to be altered to accommodate their beliefs or practices.

Critics of the current immigration narrative argue that the notion of cultural integration should not be interpreted as a rejection of diversity. Rather, they contend that a strong national identity can coexist with an appreciation of varying cultural backgrounds, as long as the primary values and traditions of the nation remain intact.

As America evaluates its approach to immigration, the challenge lies in balancing the welcoming of diverse groups with the preservation of its fundamental identity. The call for immigrants to adapt to local customs resonates with many who fear that widespread cultural retention could lead to fragmentation within society.

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a tense confrontation during a riot in North Carolina, a white driver found himself surrounded by a group of Black Lives Matter protesters. Initially, bystanders observed the scene with concern, fearing that the driver could be in danger of being mugged. As the situation unfolded, many were uncertain about what would happen next.

However, in an unexpected turn of events, the protesters decided to allow the driver to pass without any incident. This moment of de-escalation offered a brief respite in a potentially volatile situation, leaving many observers puzzled about the underlying motives of both the driver and the protesters.

As the crowd began to part, the driver chose to display a handgun out of his window, prompting a swift dispersal of the protesters. This action raised questions among those who witnessed the encounter. The display of the weapon seemed to signal a decisive end to the tense moment, but it also highlighted the polarizing nature of responding to confrontations with hostile groups.

Opinions are divided regarding the appropriateness of the driver’s actions. Some argue that brandishing a weapon was not a necessary response, suggesting that the driver could have simply navigated his way through the crowd without leading to escalation. Others contend that his display was a protective measure, the last resort in an unpredictable and potentially threatening situation.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding civil protests and the responses they invoke. With emotions running high on both sides, the actions taken during confrontations often result in intense discussions about safety, rights, and the appropriate course of action in the face of aggression.

As communities reflect on this encounter, it raises pivotal questions regarding the balance between self-defense and the need for peaceful dialogue in times of unrest. The broader implications of such incidents continue to resonate, leaving an opening for future conversations on conflict resolution and civil rights activism.",-18.0,-17.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,366.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04644808743169399
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago environmentalists are facing accusations of hypocrisy regarding their support for the Obama Presidential Library while opposing the George Lucas Museum project. This contradiction has drawn scrutiny as prominent figures express divergent stances on construction that could significantly impact green spaces in the city.

Juanita Irizarry, the executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly voiced her excitement for the construction of the Obama center. This endorsement comes even as her organization previously worked to block plans for the Lucas Museum, which would have been built on a parking lot. The construction of the Obama center will involve bulldozing trees and grass in Jackson Park, raising questions about the environmental implications of such actions.

Critics argue that this scenario reflects deeper inconsistencies within leftist environmentalist positions. They label the situation as an example of ""leftist"" contradictions, pointing to what some perceive as ""white privilege"" in the supporters’ selective environmental focus. The contrasting responses to these two significant projects highlight a broader narrative of inconsistency in the support for various issues—often based on personal impacts or political affiliations.

As the debate rages on, the dual standards in environmental advocacy prompt discussion about the underlying motivations of organizations like Friends of the Parks. The ongoing discourse in Chicago raises essential questions about values, priorities, and the ethical responsibilities of environmentalists, as they navigate the complexities of urban development and community impact. The apparent divide in reactions to the Obama center and Lucas museum serves as a potent reminder of the challenges facing advocacy groups striving for consistency in their mission.",3.0,14.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,303.0,1.2727272727272727,0.0462046204620462

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

General Stanley McChrystal, formerly the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has submitted his resignation following ongoing disagreements with President Barack Obama regarding the direction of the war. This decision came after a significant confrontation in the Oval Office, where tensions between the two leaders came to a head.

During this pivotal meeting, President Obama accused McChrystal of failing to provide political support for his administration. McChrystal, sensing the end of his Army career impending, firmly responded that his allegiance was to Obama as Commander-in-Chief, rather than as a politician. This insistence on duty over political allegiance underscored the discord that had developed between the two.

In a move that reflected the gravity of the situation, McChrystal ultimately chose to submit his resignation. However, President Obama, seemingly unsatisfied with this outcome, made a pointed remark regarding McChrystal's potential feelings towards him in the afterlife. This statement highlighted the depth of their estrangement during a critical phase of military operations.

In his final moments in the Oval Office, McChrystal saluted the President and made a succinct comment about his reluctance to endure what he termed a ""line"" following his departure from the Army.

Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm.

These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

In a shocking revelation, reports indicate that approximately 70% of the rioters involved in the recent unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, were bused in from out of state. This statistic has raised concerns about the nature of the events, suggesting that the riots were not merely spontaneous demonstrations but rather a premeditated operation executed by organized groups.

A number of the rioters are reportedly carrying out-of-state identification cards, further indicating that these individuals had traveled significant distances to partake in the unrest. This fact has not gone unnoticed by local authorities. The head of the police union in Charlotte has described the individuals participating in the riots as “professional criminals,” a term that underscores the nature of the unrest and raises questions about the underlying motivations driving these protests.

Amidst the chaos in Charlotte, there are numerous claims suggesting that certain organized groups are intentionally instigating violence and disruption. These groups allegedly utilize the black community as “useful tools” to further their own agendas. This perspective posits that the turmoil is not simply a reaction to social injustices but a calculated effort by some factions to create discord and chaos, thereby polarizing communities along racial lines.

In stark contrast, the recent protests in Tulsa have yielded markedly different outcomes. Protests in Tulsa remained peaceful, a development attributed to a lack of sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement. Additionally, the swift charging of an officer involved in a shooting has played a pivotal role in defusing potential tensions in the area. This contrast between the two cities highlights the varying dynamics at play in different regions, shaped by local history and community sentiments.

Charlotte’s tumultuous past with the Black Lives Matter movement appears to have made it more susceptible to chaos and riots when compared to Tulsa. Local grievances and historical factors may create an environment ripe for unrest, particularly when external elements exacerbate existing tensions. The notion that some groups are innately seeking to cultivate chaos and racial conflict comes into sharper focus against this backdrop, suggesting that the situation in Charlotte is emblematic of larger issues at play within American society.

Critics argue that the manipulation of legitimate protests by organized factions seeking disruption is alarmingly dangerous. The rhetoric surrounding the protests is increasingly shaped by accusations of intent and strategy rather than focusing solely on the core issues that catalyze public demonstrations. This evolving narrative raises concerns about the implications for authentic movements advocating for racial justice and equality.

The interplay of professional criminals, organized groups seeking chaos, and historic grievances paints a complex picture of the current unrest in Charlotte. While the demands for justice and societal reform continue to resonate among activists, the infiltration of outsiders and professional provocateurs risks overshadowing these crucial conversations. Communities striving for progress may find their messages distorted by those who are more interested in instigating conflict.

As authorities investigate the origins and motivations behind the recent riots in Charlotte, the hope remains that a clearer understanding of these dynamics will emerge. In doing so, there may be a pathway to address the underlying issues that trigger unrest while also safeguarding the core messages of social justice and reform that many genuine protestors champion.

The stark differences between Charlotte and Tulsa serve as important case studies in understanding the multifaceted nature of protests and unrest across the United States. As conversations continue about race, justice, and the role of organized groups in movements, it is crucial to discern between genuine efforts for change and those seeking only to incite chaos and division within communities. The outcomes of these discussions will be vital in shaping the future landscape of protest in America, impacting both the narrative and reality of social movements.",-17.0,-46.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,690.0,-1.7692307692307692,-0.06666666666666667

He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:

Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”!

As the presidential campaign heats up, Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a pressing concern. Once dismissed as a ""conspiracy theory,"" claims regarding serious health issues, including neurological diseases, are gaining traction. The discussion intensified following Clinton's collapse and fainting incident on September 11, which has sparked worries even among her supporters in the media.

Adding to the intrigue, expert Clif Hite has proposed a controversial theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and been replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this claim could represent one of the most significant cover-ups in American political history. In what appears to be an organized effort, reports indicate that Russian intelligence has released a video asserting that events related to Clinton have been fabricated using green screen technology.

There are allegations surfacing that Clinton never actually left her daughter Chelsea's apartment and has been employing doubles during public appearances. Furthermore, Russian sources have gone as far as to claim they possess evidence of a secret plane crash involving Clinton, which purportedly resulted in serious injuries.

This narrative has caught the attention of figures such as Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan, who have previously reported on the alleged plane crash incident.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC.

In the escalating political landscape marked by deep divisions, a new organization has emerged, positioning itself at the forefront of efforts to challenge Donald Trump’s values. Common Defense PAC, which claims to represent the interests of veterans, is notably funded by George Soros, a figure widely recognized for his financial support of initiatives opposed to Trump’s agenda.

Common Defense PAC articulates a mission centered on protecting the rights of veterans while explicitly advocating against Trump. This new entity is part of a broader network, which Discover the Networks has reported on, consisting of 187 groups financially backed by Soros. This network has often found itself at odds with the former president’s policies and political ideals.

A significant aspect of Common Defense PAC’s approach involves the promotion of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump on social media platforms. This campaign not only amplifies its message but also aligns with the efforts of MoveOn.org, an influential progressive organization similarly dedicated to opposing Trump. The synergy between these two groups is evidenced by Common Defense PAC's sharing of anti-Trump video advertisements that lead back to petitions hosted by MoveOn.org.

The collaboration between Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org extends beyond social media campaigns. The two organizations participated in a concerted effort known as #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump. This campaign reached an impressive audience, engaging over 4.5 million individuals and urging them to reconsider their support for the former president. This partnership highlights a strategic unification among progressive groups aimed at leveraging veteran voices to challenge Trump’s narrative.

A particularly contentious aspect of Common Defense PAC’s operational strategy lies in its leadership structure. Reports indicate that the organization’s leadership team lacks identifiable contact information for the listed veterans involved. Despite its claims to advocate for veteran rights, the representation within the PAC raises questions about its authenticity and dedication to actual veteran concerns. Notably, the only veteran visibly associated with its leadership is director Perry O’Brien, who is a conscientious objector and has a history of left-wing activism. Critics have pointed out that such representation falls short of embodying the diverse voices within the veteran community.

Further scrutiny reveals that the PAC's financial backing appears limited, as indicated by its July quarterly filing report, which lists only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This limited funding may impact the PAC's reach and effectiveness as it strives to challenge the political status quo dominated by Trump’s influence.

As the PAC continues to amplify its anti-Trump rhetoric, the effectiveness of such initiatives is increasingly questioned, particularly in light of the growing influence of organizations funded by Soros. The challenges faced by Trump and the GOP certainly seem compounded by the strategic maneuvers of groups like Common Defense PAC, which have succeeded in mobilizing prominent voices and leveraging digital campaigns. 

However, as Common Defense PAC’s initial forays reveal, the representation and inclusivity within these organizations may not fully reflect the broader views of the veteran community. The reliance on a singular leadership voice, particularly that of O’Brien, raises the stakes for how veterans' issues are highlighted and advanced in the public arena. Critics argue that for such campaigns to resonate genuinely, they must encapsulate a wider spectrum of veteran experiences and sentiments.

With Common Defense PAC emerging as a challenger in the political discourse against Trump, it remains to be seen how effectively it can galvanize support among veterans and the general public. The implications of Soros’ funding in shaping narratives and influencing political actions continue to stir debate among activists and political commentators. As the 2024 election approaches, the dynamic interplay between funding, representation, and messaging will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the future political landscape, particularly as entities like Common Defense PAC empower dissenting voices within the military community. 

As both sides prepare for an upcoming battle of ideals and values, the effectiveness, authenticity, and inclusivity of these initiatives will be pivotal in determining their success in a polarized political climate. The future of veteran advocacy and its intersection with partisan politics appears ripe for ongoing scrutiny and development.",8.0,36.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,786.0,1.2413793103448276,0.04580152671755725

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has uncovered that the Obama State Department allocated more than $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques abroad. This revelation, which originally came to light in 2015, has remained largely under the radar but continues to generate significant concern among taxpayers and critics alike.

The financial outlay for these projects has raised eyebrows, especially as critics argue that such spending may inadvertently support the growth of terrorism. Opponents of the funding question the appropriateness of directing foreign aid specifically toward religious sites, particularly in regions where extremist ideologies have strongholds.

One vocal critic of this funding initiative is Jared Thomas, a recognized taxpayer advocate, who has expressed outrage over the government's spending decisions. According to Thomas, the focus on funding mosque renovations is troubling, particularly when the United States grapples with pressing domestic economic challenges, such as high unemployment rates and a struggling workforce. He contends that taxpayer dollars should prioritize American needs instead of being funneled into international religious projects.

While the State Department has defended this expenditure as a component of broader efforts to combat Islamic extremism and to foster constructive relationships with Islamic leaders, this rationalization has not quelled criticism. Many Americans are growing increasingly discontent with prioritizing foreign aid directed towards mosques when they feel that domestic economic issues should take precedence.

The article further delves into the implications of redistributing U.S. wealth to Islamic nations. Critics argue that such expenditures not only undermine national interests but may also play a role in influencing U.S. demographics. This concern is particularly pronounced in light of ongoing discussions about the resettlement of Muslim refugees in the United States, with some suggesting that these policies could reshape social and cultural dynamics within the country.

In recent years, there has been a persistent push for greater transparency and accountability in foreign aid spending. The allocation of substantial funds for the renovation of mosques abroad raises questions not just about fiscal responsibility, but also about the government's strategic priorities when it comes to international assistance.

The CBS investigation sheds light on a broader debate regarding the role of the U.S. in global affairs. As taxpayer sentiment grows increasingly critical of foreign expenditures, there is an underlying call for the government to reassess its approach to overseas aid, particularly when significant economic resources are needed at home. The juxtaposition of funding foreign religious sites while facing domestic poverty and job scarcity creates a narrative of misplaced priorities, resonating strongly with many constituents.

This investigation invites further scrutiny into how such foreign aid projects are selected and funded, particularly in a landscape where some Americans may feel that their interests are being overlooked in favor of international objectives. As discussions surrounding government spending continue to unfold, the impact of these past decisions may influence policymakers and taxpayer sentiment for years to come.

In summary, the CBS investigation into the Obama-era mosque renovation funding has reignited a critical debate over foreign aid policies, tapping into widespread sentiment regarding the prioritization of taxpayer dollars. With calls for greater accountability and transparency on how funds are allocated internationally, the pressure mounts on legislators to ensure the interests of U.S. citizens remain front and center in discussions about foreign assistance. As the nation navigates through economic challenges, the question of how best to use taxpayer money becomes more pressing than ever.",-13.0,-2.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,627.0,-0.09090909090909091,-0.003189792663476874

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Their readiness to engage with terrorists reflects a steadfast commitment to the values of American freedom and security.

The timing of this campaign is particularly significant, coming on the heels of a series of recent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. These events have heightened awareness of the persistent threat posed by terrorism, and the billboards serve as a reminder that fear is not an option. By displaying messages of courage and staunch resistance, the Marines aim to send a clear signal that intimidation tactics will not prevail in American society.

However, the response from liberal factions has been less than supportive. Critics often argue that these displays of strength may escalate tensions and prioritize militaristic solutions over diplomacy and appeasement strategies. They suggest that a more conciliatory approach may be required to address the complex root causes of terrorism. Yet, many proponents of the billboard initiative argue that genuine self-defense and a show of force are crucial in the face of threats that seek to undermine the foundations of American life.

The underlying message of the billboard campaign resonates with a powerful narrative: if citizens refuse to live in fear, terrorists lose their power. By adopting a stance that promotes courage, the Marines effectively counteract the agenda of groups like ISIS, which thrives on chaos and intimidation. This initiative not only seeks to bolster national morale but also aims to rally public support around collective resilience in the face of adversity.

As these billboards continue to appear across the nation, they challenge individuals to reconsider the impact of fear on their daily lives and the broader societal implications of terrorism. The Marines’ campaign stands as a testament to their commitment to protect American values while simultaneously sending a clear message to those who would seek to sow discord: fear is not an option, and we will confront threats openly and boldly.",-53.0,-16.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,470.0,-0.8888888888888888,-0.03404255319148936

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is currently in disarray as widespread riots have significantly disrupted the city, characterized by rampant looting and violence. In response to the escalating situation, Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to assist local law enforcement in restoring order.

City officials have taken a strong stance against the civil unrest. A newly announced proclamation aims to hold rioters—and their families—accountable for their actions. Individuals apprehended for participating in riots, looting, or engaging in acts of violence will face severe repercussions, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This measure is part of a broader effort to deter individuals from joining the riots and to minimize future disturbances.

Furthermore, the ramifications of involvement in violence extend toward minor children. As concerns rise over youth participation in the riots, officials are emphasizing the need for parental responsibility. Parents of minors who partake in violent acts may not only lose their state benefits but could also face custody issues regarding their children. City official Wilson Stewart underscored the importance of this responsibility during a press conference, urging parents to guide their children away from violent and unlawful behaviors.

Reports indicate that numerous detained individuals are high school students, raising alarms among community leaders and officials alike. In light of the situation, parents are strongly encouraged to ensure their children adhere to a mandatory curfew that has been established as part of the city's efforts to restore peace. Officials believe that the implementation of a curfew, combined with heightened parental involvement, could be effective in preventing further youth engagement in violence.

As the city grapples with the fallout from the riots, the ongoing chaos has sparked concern among residents and business owners who have witnessed the devastation firsthand. Many are left wondering about the future of their community and the safety of their neighborhoods.

Local authorities remain adamant that their measures are necessary to protect citizens and restore order. The hope is that with the imposition of strict penalties for riot participants and an emphasis on parental responsibility, the community can recover from these tumultuous events and pave the way for a more stable environment.

The ongoing unrest in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the challenges cities face when civil disputes escalate into violence. As officials work tirelessly to quell the riots, the role of the community in supporting law enforcement and promoting peaceful solutions is more crucial than ever.

The situation remains fluid, and city officials are closely monitoring developments while coordinating with the National Guard. As residents look to the future, the hope is that swift actions can restore a sense of calm and safety back to Charlotte.",-33.0,-20.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,508.0,-0.9523809523809523,-0.03937007874015748

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

The FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal has ignited a wave of criticism directed at FBI Director James Comey, prompting scrutiny over his decision-making and the integrity of the inquiry. Central to these criticisms is Comey's controversial choice to grant immunity to several top aides involved in the case, notably Cheryl Mills, Clinton's Chief of Staff. This decision has drawn particular ire due to Mills’ lack of cooperation with the FBI, including her refusal to submit her computer for examination.

As the fallout from the investigation continues, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28 aimed at determining Comey’s future in his role as FBI Director. The probe into Clinton’s handling of classified information during her tenure as Secretary of State has raised numerous questions, particularly surrounding the methods and ethics employed in the investigation.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has emerged as a prominent critic, openly calling for Comey's resignation. DiGenova has expressed serious concerns regarding Comey’s fitness for office, arguing that the integrity of the investigation has been compromised. He contends that the FBI should have convened a grand jury and issued a subpoena for Mills’ computer, labeling the handling of the case as a ""protected investigation"" undeserving of the legitimacy that should accompany such serious inquiries.

Calls for further congressional hearings have gained traction as critics believe it is imperative to evaluate the conduct of the investigation. The public outcry reflects growing frustration over the perception that the investigation may not have been carried out with the transparency and rigor expected by the American people.

Adding to the mounting pressures on Comey, he has received a subpoena from Congress, demanding documents related to the Clinton email investigation that he has previously failed to produce. This latest development raises further questions about the FBI Director's compliance and willingness to provide full disclosure in a matter that has captivated the nation for years.

As scrutiny intensifies, some observers are raising pointed questions about Comey’s loyalty to Clinton. Speculation abounds regarding whether Comey is prepared to protect the former Secretary of State at the potential cost of his own career. Critics openly ponder whether he is willing to risk his position or even face legal repercussions to shield Clinton from the fallout of the investigation.

With the potential hearings looming and the criticism of Comey mounting, the nation watches closely as the controversy unfolds. The integrity of federal investigations relies heavily on the public's trust, and as demands for accountability grow louder, the future of the Clinton email investigation and Comey's leadership at the FBI hang in the balance. Determining the implications of this scandal will likely have reverberating effects on both public perception and institutional integrity within the federal investigative framework.",-17.0,-8.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,522.0,-0.4444444444444444,-0.01532567049808429

As scrutiny over the United States' ongoing support for Saudi Arabia intensifies, serious allegations surface regarding the kingdom's involvement in human rights abuses and its questionable financial connections. These concerns have raised significant ethical questions about the political ties between American leaders and the Gulf state, particularly in light of its reported funding practices and accusations linked to the Islamic State's offenses.

In a development that brings to light the perceived influence of foreign money in American politics, it has been alleged that Saudi Arabia funded 20% of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. This revelation has stirred deep ethical considerations as observers question the integrity of political figures who maintain ties with entities linked to serious human rights violations. Critics argue that financial backing from a nation with a controversial human rights record is problematic, considering ongoing grievances related to its treatment of both citizens and those of other nationalities.

Further compounding these concerns, Saudi Arabia stands accused ofAuctioning the sexual slavery of victims captured by the Islamic State, a practice that has elicited outrage from human rights organizations and activists alike. Reports suggest that buyers of these women and children span a wide demographic, including Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis, and Western nationals. The very notion of women and children being sold into slavery is described as monstrous, prompting urgent calls for intervention. Observers assert that the international community must take a firm stance against such atrocities, emphasizing the moral imperative to protect the vulnerable populations, especially those targeted due to their religious beliefs.

The Islamic State's abhorrent practice of sex slavery has particularly devastated non-Muslim populations, most notably the Yazidis and Christians. These communities have faced brutal campaigns leading to mass abductions, forced conversions, and systemic rape. The reports detailing the situation highlight the dire need for a united global response to combat these violations against basic human dignity, raising alarms over the complicity of foreign entities like Saudi Arabia in supporting such actions.

Such claims raise the troubling possibility that Saudi Arabia may not be acting in isolation but rather as part of a larger political web that could include other state actors like Russia. Allegations suggest that both nations contribute funds to the Islamic State, further complicating the geopolitical landscape and underscoring the necessity for a thorough investigation into the funding sources that catalyze these inhumane practices. This potential complicity not only jeopardizes the safety of individuals caught in the crossfire but also questions the motivations and integrity of politicians who benefit from relationships with regimes facilitating human trafficking.

The revelations surrounding Saudi Arabia’s alleged involvement in human trafficking and its financial entanglements with U.S. political campaigns raise pressing ethical dilemmas. As influential politicians wrestle with the implications of accepting financial support from nations accused of funding top-tier criminal organizations, the onus falls on them to reassess their relationships with such entities.

Increasing calls for accountability resonate in the political sphere as these issues take center stage. Advocacy groups are urging lawmakers to prioritize human rights and ethical standards when forming alliances or accepting funds that could tarnish their reputations. The situation necessitates a reevaluation of both foreign and domestic policy concerning nations that violate basic human rights, with a keen focus on the implications for political integrity in the United States.

As this story unfolds, it is clear that the intersection of politics, foreign funding, and human rights cannot be overlooked. The allegations against Saudi Arabia serve as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of political complicity and the urgent need for comprehensive reform. With growing momentum for humanitarian intervention, the international community is poised at a critical juncture, where the actions taken now could redefine the global landscape of justice and human rights in the years to come.",-30.0,-25.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,697.0,-1.0869565217391304,-0.035868005738880916
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

In the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump engaged in a series of intense exchanges that reflected the contentious nature of the campaign. The debate, moderated by Lester Holt, showcased the distinct approaches of both candidates, though it was also marked by criticism directed at the moderator himself.

Holt faced backlash for his handling of the debate, particularly for frequently interrupting Trump in what many viewed as an attempt to ""fact-check"" him. Critics pointed out that Holt’s fact-checks were often inaccurate, raising questions about the moderator's impartiality. During one notable exchange, Holt asserted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from its inception, a claim that Trump vehemently denied. Instead of directing similar scrutiny towards Clinton, who had voted in favor of the war, Holt focused on Trump, referencing a previous interview where Trump expressed hesitations about the invasion.

In that past interview, Trump had advocated for caution, stressing the importance of deliberation and the potential role of the United Nations in handling the situation. This context seemed to have been overlooked during the debate, leading to further criticism of Holt's moderation style. Critics argued that it would have been prudent for the moderator to question Clinton more rigorously about her authorization of the war, especially considering her access to information that Trump did not possess at the time.

The debate, which was expected to be a platform for substantive political discussion, instead turned into a battleground where media criticism emerged as a focal point. Many observers expressed concern that the media might be using the debate format to undermine Trump rather than fostering a thorough and fair examination of the candidates’ positions on key issues. This sentiment echoed throughout social media platforms, where commentators discussed the implications of the moderator’s approach.

Amidst the interruptions and pointed exchanges with Holt, Trump managed to effectively articulate his arguments and address the criticisms levied by both Clinton and the media. His responses showcased a blend of defiance and confidence, marking a sharp contrast to Clinton's more composed demeanor. The dynamic evident during the debate underscored the polarizing nature of both candidates, with supporters on either side championing their chosen nominee’s performance.

As the election cycle progresses, the first presidential debate has set the tone for future discussions, highlighting the importance of moderator neutrality and the need for balance in political discourse. As voters prepare for the upcoming election, the impressions made during this debate will likely play a significant role in shaping public opinion on both candidates.",-9.0,2.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,493.0,0.11764705882352941,0.004056795131845842
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

A 2004 article from Breitbart News has sparked renewed discussions regarding former President Barack Obama’s birthplace, stirring echoes of the Birther movement that once dominated political discourse. The article was penned during Obama’s candidacy for the Illinois Senate after rival Jack Ryan withdrew from the race amid a scandal. Notably, the piece refers to Obama as “Kenyan-born,” a characterization that some interpret as indicative of an underlying bias against the then-aspiring senator.

The implications of the Breitbart article suggest a contradiction in the narrative surrounding Obama, casting doubt on his claims about his origins. The author posits that Obama has never fully refuted the ""Kenyan-born"" label, a term that continues to circulate in online spaces. This assertion raises questions about the former president’s stance on the claims surrounding his birthplace, which have long been used by critics to challenge his legitimacy.

Compounding the controversy, a 1991 booklet produced by Obama’s literary agency, Acton & Dystel, described him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” This promotional material was created in anticipation of his first book and has since been referenced by detractors as evidence of inconsistency in Obama’s narrative about his origins.

The resurfacing of these points not only reignites debates about Obama’s birthplace but also casts a shadow over his authenticity. The author of the Breitbart article insinuates that there may have been some manipulation of identity on Obama's part, suggesting that such actions could have been undertaken for personal gain. This speculation taps into broader themes regarding political identity and authenticity, particularly in an era where misinformation can rapidly spread and shape public perception.

As debates heat up once more, the relevance of the original Breitbart article cannot be understated. Its claims resonate with ongoing questions surrounding not just Obama, but also the larger political landscape in which identity, race, and legitimacy are frequently at the forefront of public discussion.

For those seeking to explore the matter further, a link to the full quote in context from the original article has been made available, allowing for deeper examination of the claims made and their implications. As history shows, the scrutiny of a political figure’s origins often bears significant weight in public perception, and Obama’s narrative is no exception. The implications of the past continue to influence dialogues today, demonstrating how the threads of political discourse are interwoven with personal histories and broader societal narratives.",-18.0,-10.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,473.0,-0.6666666666666666,-0.021141649048625793

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In recent days, the political landscape has been abuzz following a contentious debate that prominently featured former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The evening was marred by controversy, particularly centered around allegations of bias from the debate moderator, which drew widespread attention and debate among viewers and analysts alike.

As the debate unfolded, observers were quick to note that Clinton appeared to be free from the coughing fits that have previously characterized her public speaking engagements. This observation led many to conclude that Clinton's performance may have been significantly improved from past events, suggesting that she was perhaps more prepared than before. However, not all commentary was positive, as skeptics raised additional questions amid the excitement.

As social media lit up with commentary, one particular subject garnered heightened speculation: a small, flesh-colored object that appeared to be nestled in Clinton's ear. This sparked a flurry of theories regarding the nature of the object—whether it was an earpiece designed to provide her with outside assistance or merely an innocuous fashion accessory. Many users took to various platforms to express their theories, resulting in a mix of serious inquiries and more lighthearted conjectures.

In response to the swirling rumors, Clinton’s campaign released a statement firmly denying that the object was an earpiece. Campaign representatives attributed its visibility to the reflections caused by the bright studio lights, further asserting that there was nothing unusual about her appearance. The dismissal of the claims was intended to quell growing doubts and clarify the situation for her supporters.

However, the narrative took on a new dimension when a WikiLeaks email resurfaced, referencing a discussion about an earpiece. The mention, although seemingly minor, added layers to the ongoing intrigue surrounding Clinton's performance. Critics of Clinton seized upon the email, suggesting it implied a need for assistance during her debate performance, leading to even more speculation regarding the intentions and preparations made by her campaign.

As discussions over the debate and Clinton's performance continued, numerous observers commented on the broader implications of the incident. Some critics remarked on the notion that perceived assistance during public engagements could cast doubt on a candidate's credibility, with remarks centering on an implied need for support when articulating responses. This fuelled a wider conversation around transparency and fairness in the political arena.

With uncertainties surrounding the device’s true nature lingering in public discussion, speculation remained rampant. Some theorized that it could either be a hearing aid, an earpiece, or even an optical illusion created by the harsh studio lighting. Each theory carried its own weight, as was evident from the plethora of opinions shared across social media.

Ultimately, the intersection of technology and politics has never been more pronounced, as this debate illustrates. The envelope of scrutiny remains tightly wrapped around Clinton's campaign following the debate, with lingering curiosity over what those watching truly witnessed. The fallout will likely continue, leading up to further discussions regarding the integrity of political communication strategies.",-5.0,5.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,566.0,0.21739130434782608,0.0088339222614841
