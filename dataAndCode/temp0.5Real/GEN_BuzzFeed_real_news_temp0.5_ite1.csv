Real_1-Webpage,Another Terrorist Attack in NYC…Why Are we STILL Being Politically Correct – Eagle Rising,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

On the evening of September 17, at approximately 8:30 pm EST, a powerful explosion shook the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, injuring 29 individuals and causing significant property damage. The blast originated from a homemade bomb that had been placed in a dumpster on West 23rd Street. Remarkably, despite the chaos and destruction, there were no fatalities reported as a result of the incident.

The explosion in Chelsea was not an isolated event. In a chilling follow-up, law enforcement officials discovered a second device on West 27th Street, which bore a striking resemblance to a ""pressure cooker"" bomb. This device was notably similar to those used in the infamous Boston Marathon bombing, raising alarms about a potential pattern of targeted attacks in urban areas.

In the aftermath of the explosion, all individuals who sustained injuries were treated and subsequently released from local hospitals by Sunday morning, providing some relief amid the turmoil. Nevertheless, the incident has sparked a wave of fear and concern regarding the safety of public spaces, especially given that it followed a separate bomb explosion in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, during a charity race. Thankfully, that incident resulted in no casualties, but the connection between the two events has heightened anxieties about potential coordinated attacks.

Investigators have established a link between the explosives found in New York and New Jersey, suggesting that they may be the work of the same individual. This connection has intensified the scrutiny on the broader implications of domestic terrorism, particularly in light of recent significant attacks across various locations.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the media following the explosion, asserting that while there was no specific threat from any known terror organizations, the explosion was clearly an intentional act. His remarks underscore the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement in preventing such incidents and maintaining public safety.

Police Commissioner James O’Neill further clarified the situation by ruling out a natural gas leak as the cause of the explosion, reinforcing the notion that the incident was a deliberate attack. This determination adds to the urgency of the investigation, as authorities work to identify the perpetrator and prevent any future incidents.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo weighed in on the situation, labeling the explosion an act of terrorism. He emphasized the gravity of the situation, stating that any bomb explosion in the state should be treated with the utmost seriousness, even in the absence of claims of responsibility from specific terrorist groups. The lack of a clear perpetrator, however, has left many questions unanswered and has contributed to a heightened sense of vulnerability among residents.

The ramifications of the Chelsea explosion extend beyond the immediate physical damage and injuries. The incident has reignited discussions about the United States' susceptibility to attacks on ""soft targets""—public spaces that are often less fortified against such threats. Political leaders, including presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have commented on the incident, with Trump advocating for a tougher stance on security measures in response to the growing threat of terrorism.

The Chelsea explosion serves as a stark reminder of the need for strong leadership and comprehensive strategies to protect citizens from the ever-evolving landscape of terrorism. As investigations continue and law enforcement agencies work tirelessly to track down the individual responsible for these attacks, the public remains on high alert, acutely aware of the potential for violence in everyday settings.

The events of that fateful evening in Chelsea have left an indelible mark on the community and have prompted a nationwide conversation about safety, preparedness, and the resilience of urban centers in the face of adversity. As the investigation unfolds, the hope is that those responsible will be held accountable, and that measures can be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.

In the aftermath of the explosion, the focus remains on healing for the injured and the community, as well as on the broader implications for national security and public safety. The resilience of New Yorkers has been tested once again, and as they come together to support one another, the call for vigilance and proactive measures against terrorism has never been more urgent.

As the nation grapples with the realities of living in a world where such threats exist, the Chelsea explosion serves as a poignant reminder of the need for unity, preparedness, and a commitment to safeguarding the values and freedoms that define American society. The views expressed in this article reflect the author's perspective and do not necessarily represent the opinions of EagleRising.com. 

As investigations proceed and the community seeks to recover from this traumatic event, the hope is that lessons learned will lead to stronger safeguards against future threats, ensuring that public spaces remain safe havens for all. The fight against terrorism is ongoing, and the need for vigilance has never been more critical.",-43.0,-35.0,930.0,-1.2285714285714286,-0.046236559139784944,904.0,-1.1290322580645162,-0.03871681415929203
Real_10-Webpage,"Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests","Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.

""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.

The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.

""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""

He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.

""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""

But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.

Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.

During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""

Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.

Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.

""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.

In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",http://abcn.ws/2d4lNn9,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg,"More Candace,Adam Kelsey,Abc News,More Adam",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437,"{""fb_title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@adam_kels"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-22"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-22"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-22 14:33:00"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh""}","- Protests erupted in North Carolina following the police killing of African-American man Keith Lamont Scott.

Charlotte, North Carolina – Protests erupted across the city following the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man, igniting tensions and drawing national attention to issues of police violence and community unrest. The demonstrations began peacefully but escalated into violence, with police deploying tear gas to disperse crowds. The situation intensified as reports emerged of a demonstrator in critical condition due to a gunshot wound, underscoring the severity of the unrest.

In the midst of these protests, Donald Trump addressed the unrest during a speech at the Shale Insight 2016 Conference. He attributed some of the escalating tensions to the impact of drugs, a statement that reflects his broader approach to law and order issues. Trump condemned the violence that unfolded during the protests, calling for national unity and emphasizing the importance of public safety in his remarks.

While Trump praised law enforcement for their efforts, he also highlighted the necessity for better training and accountability for police officers. His comments come at a time when many communities are calling for reform in policing practices, particularly in relation to the treatment of African-Americans. However, Trump did not address the broader issue of violence against African-Americans by police, which protesters cite as a critical reason for their demonstrations. This omission has raised questions about the administration's engagement with the underlying issues that fuel such protests.

In an effort to connect with African-American voters, Trump has questioned what they have to lose by supporting his candidacy. He described the conditions in inner cities as being poor for African-American communities, despite census data indicating significant educational and economic progress among black Americans. This juxtaposition has sparked discussions about the realities faced by these communities and the narrative presented by political leaders.

Trump's remarks also touched upon the controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy, which he claimed was effective in New York. However, he later clarified that his reference was specifically to a strategy intended for implementation in Chicago. The mention of such policies often stirs debate, as they have been criticized for disproportionately targeting minority communities and raising concerns about racial profiling.

In his speech, Trump made a clear distinction between ""violent disruptors"" and the broader African-American community. He emphasized the importance of supporting African-American families in their efforts to raise children in a safe and nurturing environment. This focus on family values resonates with many voters, but it also invites scrutiny regarding the administration's commitment to addressing systemic issues that affect these families.

As protests in Charlotte continue, the calls for justice and accountability grow louder. Activists emphasize that the demonstrations are not solely about the death of Keith Lamont Scott but are part of a larger movement against systemic racism and police brutality. The unrest in North Carolina reflects a growing frustration among many communities who feel marginalized and unheard.

The events in Charlotte serve as a microcosm of the national conversation surrounding police violence and racial inequality. The protests have drawn supporters from various backgrounds, united in their demand for justice and a change in how law enforcement interacts with communities of color. As the situation develops, the response from political leaders and law enforcement will be closely scrutinized by both supporters and critics.

In the wake of the protests, local leaders and activists are calling for dialogue and reform. They argue that meaningful change can only occur through an acknowledgment of the issues at hand and a commitment to addressing them comprehensively. The protests in Charlotte may serve as a catalyst for broader discussions about race, policing, and the future of community relations in America.

As the nation watches the events unfold in North Carolina, the impact of the protests is likely to resonate beyond the state, influencing the political landscape and shaping the discourse around race and justice in the upcoming election. The challenge for leaders, including Trump, will be to engage with the concerns of the community and work towards solutions that promote healing and unity.

Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.

Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”

So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.

Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.

How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right?

In a recent address to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama made a compelling case for the acceptance of certain constraints on national freedom in the interest of enhancing global security. His remarks sparked significant debate, particularly regarding the implications for national sovereignty and safety.

Obama articulated a vision in which powerful nations, including the United States, should bind themselves to international norms and multilateral institutions. He argued that a commitment to these frameworks would not only strengthen international cooperation but also bolster security. The former president emphasized that relinquishing some freedom of action would not compromise the U.S.'s ability to protect itself or pursue its core interests. This perspective suggests a shift away from the traditional notion of absolute national sovereignty, advocating instead for a more interconnected approach to global governance.

A central theme of Obama's address was the need for nations to assist those in need, particularly in the context of accommodating Muslim refugees. He posited that the world would be more secure if countries took proactive steps to support vulnerable populations. This call for humanitarian action raises questions about the balance between national security and the moral obligation to help those fleeing conflict and persecution. However, critics of Obama's stance have voiced concerns that such policies could undermine national sovereignty and safety.

The article critiques Obama's approach, drawing on Germany's experience with unvetted refugees as a cautionary tale. Critics argue that the influx of large numbers of refugees without proper vetting procedures can pose significant risks to national security. They express skepticism about the effectiveness of accepting refugees as a means to enhance security, suggesting that such actions could inadvertently create vulnerabilities rather than mitigate them.

Furthermore, the author of the critique characterizes Obama's stance as emblematic of a typical liberal agenda, which they believe could weaken the United States and infringe upon constitutional rights. This apprehension reflects a broader concern among some segments of the population about the potential consequences of prioritizing international norms over domestic interests.

The debate surrounding Obama's address underscores a fundamental tension in contemporary discussions about national sovereignty, security, and humanitarian responsibility. Supporters of Obama's vision argue that a collaborative approach to global challenges is essential in an increasingly interconnected world. They contend that embracing international norms can lead to greater stability and security for all nations involved.

Conversely, opponents warn that such an approach risks compromising the very foundations of national sovereignty and the safety of citizens. They argue that while the intention to assist those in need is commendable, it must be balanced with a rigorous assessment of the potential risks associated with accepting large numbers of refugees.

As the discourse continues, the implications of Obama's address at the UN General Assembly remain a focal point for policymakers and citizens alike. The challenge lies in finding a pragmatic balance between the moral imperative to assist those in need and the necessity of safeguarding national interests and security. The conversation surrounding these issues is likely to evolve as nations grapple with the complexities of global interdependence in the face of pressing security concerns.

In conclusion, Obama's call for nations to embrace international norms and assist vulnerable populations has reignited a contentious debate about the interplay between national sovereignty and global responsibility. As the world continues to confront multifaceted challenges, the need for a nuanced dialogue on these issues has never been more pressing.",23.0,19.0,576.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03993055555555555,640.0,0.76,0.0296875
Real_12-Webpage,Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works,"Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump’s vision.

As he made clear once again in Monday night’s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.”

Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ‘I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “Incomes went up for everybody.”

Story Continued Below

That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “My whole life is about winning. … I always win,” Trump says in explaining why he’s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “Winning the Global Competition.” You don’t get more zero-sum than that.

Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–Trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.

The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.

Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.

No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan’s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.

Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.

Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.

The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders’ powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.

Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. They aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.

We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.

In the landscape of American politics, economic ideologies have played a pivotal role in shaping the narratives and strategies of candidates. The 2016 election underscored a significant divide between two contrasting economic philosophies, primarily embodied by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. At the heart of this divide is the perception of the economy as a zero-sum game, a viewpoint Trump strongly advocates, juxtaposed against Clinton’s vision of an inclusive economic model aimed at expanding opportunities for all.

Donald Trump’s perspective on the economy is rooted in the belief that one person's gain inevitably translates into another's loss. This zero-sum mentality informs much of his rhetoric and policy proposals. He has been vocally critical of trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which he argues has had a detrimental impact on American manufacturing. Trump’s advocacy for protecting U.S. jobs from foreign competition resonates with a segment of the electorate that feels marginalized by the rapid changes in the economy. His narrative finds traction among those who perceive themselves as losers in the global economic landscape, despite broader statistics indicating overall economic growth, such as a 5.2% increase in median income.

In stark contrast, Hillary Clinton champions a more inclusive economic model. She draws on the successes of the 1990s, during her husband Bill Clinton’s presidency, to illustrate the potential for an economy that benefits all citizens. Clinton’s approach emphasizes the importance of expanding opportunities, suggesting that a thriving economy should lift everyone rather than create winners and losers. This fundamental difference in worldview is not merely an economic debate but reflects deeper societal values and beliefs about fairness, opportunity, and the role of government in facilitating economic growth.

The 2016 election became a battleground for these conflicting ideologies, as voters were polarized between those who identified as winners in the global economy—often leaning Democratic—and those who felt left behind, gravitating towards Trump’s message. This division was not strictly based on economic status; it also encapsulated broader worldviews regarding economic growth and opportunity. The electorate was split between those who embraced globalization and open trade, and those who perceived such policies as threats to their livelihoods.

Economists, as a collective, generally endorse globalization and open trade as mechanisms that enhance overall wealth and economic resilience. They argue that these policies can drive innovation, create jobs, and improve living standards in the long run. However, the rapid pace of economic change has left many individuals feeling insecure and threatened, leading to a backlash against established economic norms. This sentiment echoes historical concerns reminiscent of the Progressive Movement of the 1890s, which highlighted issues of inequality and the struggles faced by the working class.

Trump’s narrative, while polarizing, has found some unexpected allies among business leaders and Wall Street, who may share his worldview regarding competition and economic protectionism. Despite not necessarily financially backing him, these figures recognize the appeal of his message to a substantial portion of the electorate. This alignment underscores the complexities of modern economic discourse, where traditional party lines can blur in the face of pressing economic concerns.

The implications of a zero-sum approach to economics are significant and potentially perilous. A worldview that pits individuals against each other can foster economic insecurity and conflict, as people scramble to protect their interests in a perceived zero-sum game. Conversely, an open economy, characterized by collaboration and shared growth, has the potential to drive innovation, create new opportunities, and bolster national strength. The challenge for policymakers and leaders is to navigate these competing narratives and find a path that promotes inclusive growth while addressing the legitimate concerns of those who feel left behind.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the economic divide illustrated by the 2016 election remains a critical issue. Understanding the underlying beliefs and values that shape voter behavior will be essential for future leaders seeking to bridge the gap between competing economic philosophies. The conversation about the economy is far from over, and its outcomes will undoubtedly influence the trajectory of American society for years to come.",72.0,42.0,1571.0,1.3333333333333333,0.04583068109484405,776.0,1.4482758620689655,0.05412371134020619
Real_13-Webpage,"President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill, Setting Up Showdown With Congress","President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

“I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message.

“I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”

The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.

Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.

The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.

If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.

Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.

""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.

""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.""

But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks.

In a significant move, President Obama has vetoed the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" (JASTA), a bill that would have allowed survivors of the September 11 attacks and the families of victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. The veto comes in the wake of an overwhelming congressional approval of the legislation, setting the stage for a potential override that could mark a pivotal moment in Obama’s presidency.

In his statement regarding the veto, Obama expressed deep sympathy for the families who lost loved ones in the tragic events of 9/11, acknowledging their relentless pursuit of justice. He recognized the emotional weight behind their desire for accountability, yet he maintained that the legislation posed significant risks to the United States' legal framework and international relations.

Should JASTA have been enacted, it would have paved the way for lawsuits against foreign governments linked to terrorism-related damages. The White House has raised concerns that the bill could undermine the principle of ""sovereign immunity,"" a legal doctrine that protects foreign nations from being sued in U.S. courts. Administration officials argue that this could expose the United States to retaliatory lawsuits from other countries, potentially destabilizing existing diplomatic relationships.

The veto could become a defining moment in Obama’s second term, as it stands to be his first override, a notable occurrence considering his generally high approval ratings. The last president to complete a term without a veto override was Lyndon B. Johnson, making this situation particularly historic. 

The passage of JASTA was marked by unanimous support from both the House of Representatives and the Senate, showcasing a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in an often-divided Congress. However, overriding a presidential veto requires a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers, which presents a considerable challenge. The White House is actively working to secure enough Democratic votes to block any override efforts, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the integrity of U.S. foreign relations.

The legislation has garnered significant support from many families of 9/11 victims, who feel that they have not had their day in court. They argue that the ability to sue foreign governments is a necessary step toward achieving justice for their loved ones and holding accountable those they believe may have played a role in the attacks. 

Conversely, Saudi Arabia has vehemently opposed the bill, asserting that it had no involvement in the 9/11 attacks. The kingdom fears that the passage of JASTA could lead to a flood of lawsuits that would tarnish its reputation and strain its relationship with the United States, a long-time ally.

In the political arena, the implications of the veto and the potential override are being closely watched. Hillary Clinton, who served as Secretary of State under Obama, has voiced her support for the legislation, stating that she would sign it into law if elected president. This stance reflects a broader debate about the balance between justice for victims and the potential fallout on international relations.

As the situation unfolds, the fate of JASTA remains uncertain. The clash between the desire for accountability and the complexities of international law continues to evoke strong emotions and debate among lawmakers, victims' families, and the public alike. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Congress will successfully override the president's veto and what that will mean for U.S. foreign policy moving forward.",-7.0,6.0,550.0,-0.4375,-0.012727272727272728,630.0,0.2727272727272727,0.009523809523809525

There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.

The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.

It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474473199000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUv7x5bXV4,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/riot.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice.

North Carolina has been rocked by protests following the shooting of a black man on a highway, igniting tensions and civil unrest in the area. The protests, which initially drew attention to the ongoing issues of racial inequality and police violence, quickly escalated into chaos as demonstrators clashed with law enforcement and engaged in violent acts.

Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement were among the crowds, advocating for justice and reform. However, the situation took a dangerous turn when rioters began throwing rocks at passing cars and trucks, effectively blocking a major interstate. This disruption not only endangered the lives of motorists but also contributed to an atmosphere of fear and lawlessness.

One particularly harrowing incident involved a female truck driver who found herself ambushed by the rioters. While she was inside her vehicle, her truck was looted and subsequently set ablaze, leaving her trapped in a terrifying situation. In her desperate attempt for help, she called the police, but reports indicate that no assistance arrived in time to prevent the violence from escalating. Media outlets captured footage of the chaos, showcasing the alarming breakdown of order on the highway.

As the night wore on, the consequences of the unrest became increasingly severe. By the end of the evening, 16 police officers had sustained injuries while trying to manage the situation, and the freeway was completely shut down. These developments have raised serious concerns about public safety and the effectiveness of the protests in achieving their intended goals.

Critics of the protests have voiced their disapproval, arguing that such violent actions undermine the very cause that activists are fighting for. The destructive behavior observed during these protests stands in stark contrast to the principles espoused by civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., who advocated for love, integrity, and peaceful resistance in the pursuit of equality and justice.

The author of this article expresses disappointment in the direction that the Black Lives Matter movement has taken, suggesting that it has shifted focus from promoting unity to fostering anger and division within communities. This departure from the foundational ideals of civil rights activism raises important questions about the future of the movement and its ability to effect meaningful change.

As the protests continue to unfold, it remains crucial for activists and community leaders to reflect on the methods employed in their fight for justice. While the urgency of addressing systemic racism and police violence is undeniable, the means of achieving these goals must align with the principles of peace and respect for all individuals. The current unrest serves as a reminder that while the fight for equality is essential, the tactics used to pursue that fight can either elevate the cause or detract from its legitimacy.

In conclusion, the violence that erupted during the protests in North Carolina highlights a troubling trend within the movement for racial justice. As communities grapple with the aftermath of these events, there is a pressing need for dialogue and a return to the core values that have historically driven successful civil rights activism. Only through a commitment to peaceful protest and unity can the movement hope to achieve the lasting change it seeks.",-44.0,-40.0,572.0,-1.6296296296296295,-0.07692307692307693,589.0,-1.8181818181818181,-0.06791171477079797
Real_15-Webpage,10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.

The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.

Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:

1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.

When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.

Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.”

He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.

2. Personal Attacks Came Early

Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker.

Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics.

“For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.

3. Trading Barbs Over Trade

Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.

“And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said.

Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”

Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.”

“Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said.

Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”

4. Trump Asks ‘Why Not’ Blame All the World’s Problems on Clinton

Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.”

Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?”

Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“

Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""

5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns

Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.

“I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.

Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said.

“I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?

“Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.

6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage

Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.

At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate.

Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015.

“Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”

7. Clinton Defends Being ‘Prepared’ When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail

Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff.

""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.”

Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.

8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion

Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.

“Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said.

Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.”

“They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal.

Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.

9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope

Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.

“I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”

Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.”

The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?""

Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.”

Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”

10. Sparring Over Stamina

Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.”

""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.”

Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.

""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said.

She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:

The highly anticipated first general election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump took place on September 26, 2016, at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York. The event drew millions of viewers, eager to witness the clash of two political titans with starkly contrasting visions for the future of the United States. As the candidates took the stage, the atmosphere was charged with tension, marked by a seemingly friendly handshake that quickly gave way to sarcasm and mutual contempt.

Right from the outset, Clinton wasted no time in launching a pointed attack on Trump’s business background. She asserted that he had started his career with a substantial $14 million loan from his father, framing it as evidence of privilege and entitlement. Trump, however, was quick to counter her claims, insisting that he transformed that small loan into a multi-billion dollar enterprise. This exchange set the tone for a debate filled with sharp barbs and fierce rebuttals.

The discussion soon shifted to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a contentious trade deal that has been a focal point in the election. Trump accused Clinton of supporting the TPP, a charge she vehemently denied, asserting that she had opposed the agreement once its terms were finalized. The heated exchange highlighted the candidates’ differing perspectives on trade and its implications for American workers.

As the debate progressed, Trump suggested that Clinton would be held responsible for a range of issues affecting the country. In a moment of levity amid the tension, Clinton quipped about her reputation, saying, “I have been blamed for everything.” This exchange illustrated the candidates’ willingness to engage in banter, even as the stakes remained high.

One of the more contentious moments arose when Trump defended his decision not to release his tax returns, stating that they were currently under audit. In a bid to redirect the conversation, he attempted to shift focus to Clinton’s controversial deleted emails, a topic that has haunted her campaign. This tactic underscored Trump’s strategy of deflecting criticism while attempting to put Clinton on the defensive.

The debate also touched upon the birther issue, a topic that has lingered in the political discourse for years. Trump acknowledged President Obama’s citizenship, but he deflected blame for the birther conspiracy to Clinton’s aides, claiming they were the ones who initially raised the issue. This moment encapsulated Trump’s approach to accountability, as he sought to distance himself from the controversy while acknowledging its existence.

Clinton, facing insinuations from Trump that she was unprepared for the debate, defended her extensive preparation. She emphasized her readiness to engage on the issues, contrasting her approach with Trump’s more impulsive style. This exchange highlighted the candidates’ differing approaches to campaigning and governance, with Clinton positioning herself as the experienced candidate ready to tackle the complexities of leadership.

The controversial “stop and frisk” policy also emerged as a topic of discussion during the debate. Trump claimed that the policy had a positive impact on safety in New York City, a statement that sparked debate over its effectiveness and implications for civil rights. Clinton challenged Trump’s assertions, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to public safety that respects the rights of all citizens.

In another moment of contention, Trump denied supporting the Iraq War, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. He insisted that he had always been against the war, a claim that drew skepticism from Clinton and the audience alike. This exchange highlighted the candidates’ differing narratives regarding foreign policy and military intervention, a critical issue for voters.

As the debate neared its conclusion, the candidates engaged in a discussion about stamina, a topic that has become synonymous with the campaign. Trump questioned Clinton’s endurance, suggesting she may not be fit for the rigors of the presidency. In response, Clinton highlighted her extensive diplomatic experience and pointed out Trump’s history of making derogatory remarks about women. This exchange underscored the gender dynamics at play in the election, as both candidates sought to define their strengths in a highly competitive race.

The first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was a microcosm of the larger electoral battle, showcasing the candidates’ contrasting styles, policies, and visions for America. As they sparred over issues ranging from trade and public safety to personal accountability and experience, it was clear that the stakes were high. With the election just weeks away, both candidates left the stage with their respective bases energized, ready to continue the fight for the highest office in the land.",50.0,-15.0,2076.0,0.6024096385542169,0.024084778420038536,879.0,-0.4411764705882353,-0.017064846416382253
Real_16-Webpage,Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

“I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

“It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

“Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",http://abcn.ws/2cTj7ap,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"More Michael,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting3_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting1_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting2_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_12x5_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939,"{""fb_title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""description"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@MichaelEHayden"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:03:26"", ""keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter, us news, national news, local news"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter""}","- Peaceful protesters attended Charlotte's first city council meeting since the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 speakers opposing police violence.

In a poignant display of community activism, peaceful protesters gathered at Charlotte's first city council meeting since the tragic shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. The atmosphere was charged with emotion as over 50 speakers took to the microphone, voicing their opposition to police violence and calling for justice for Scott and others affected by similar incidents.

Among the many voices that rose during the meeting, a particularly notable moment came from young activist Zianna Oliphant. The young girl delivered an impassioned speech that struck a chord with those present, highlighting the emotional toll of police shootings on children and the broader black community. With heartfelt sincerity, Zianna spoke about the pain of losing parents to violence, referencing Scott’s seven children and emphasizing the critical need for family support in the wake of such tragedies.

Her words resonated deeply with the audience, triggering an outpouring of solidarity that culminated in chants of ""no justice, no peace."" This powerful moment underscored the profound impact of police violence on families and communities, particularly on the youth who bear the brunt of such losses.

The meeting came in the wake of intense protests that erupted in Charlotte following Scott's shooting, which had escalated tensions in the city. While many demonstrations were peaceful, some incidents turned violent, leading to confrontations between protesters and law enforcement. The situation intensified when police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets in response to the unrest, prompting protesters to retaliate with bottles and rocks, block highways, and loot businesses.

As the city council meeting unfolded, Mayor Jennifer Roberts urged attendees to maintain decorum, even as protesters voiced their frustrations towards her and Police Chief Kerr Putney. The atmosphere was charged with a mix of hope for change and a palpable sense of urgency as community members sought to make their voices heard.

After the meeting concluded, protesters gathered in the Government Center lobby, demanding the release of the full video of the incident involving Scott's shooting. The call for transparency was echoed by Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, who, in an interview, emphasized the importance of making the complete video public. He expressed the community's desire for clarity and accountability regarding the events that transpired.

In response to the calls for transparency, Chief Putney had previously released partial body and dashboard camera footage of the incident. However, significant questions remain unanswered, particularly concerning whether Scott was armed and posed a threat to the officers involved. The community's demand for the full video reflects a broader call for accountability and justice in the aftermath of police-related tragedies.

As Charlotte grapples with the fallout from Scott's shooting, the city council meeting served as a crucial platform for voices advocating for change. The emotional testimonies and passionate pleas from community members highlight the urgent need for dialogue and reform in policing practices. The legacy of Keith Lamont Scott continues to resonate within the community, driving home the message that the fight for justice and peace is far from over.

In a city marked by tension and grief, the voices of the people—especially the youngest among them—serve as a reminder of the human cost of violence and the enduring hope for a more just and equitable society. The call for justice echoes beyond the walls of the Government Center, reverberating through the streets of Charlotte as the community seeks healing and change.",-57.0,-10.0,570.0,-2.28,-0.1,639.0,-0.43478260869565216,-0.01564945226917058

Real_18-Webpage,Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night’s big debate: Don’t let Donald Trump get away with it.

And Trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.”

Story Continued Below

The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.”

“The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,” Silver tweeted.

During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.

“We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told “CBS This Morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, “that that simply be checked.”

“The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.

But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump’s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he’s a Democrat and the system is “very unfair.” The “NBC Nightly News” anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.

“I don’t know that he knew what Lester Holt’s voter registration was,” said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. “He didn’t lie,” Conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.”

In a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, Monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn’t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.

But Clinton’s campaign has beat up on Holt’s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. “In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” Janet Brown, the commission’s executive director, told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

For her part, Clinton won’t let Trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn’t, either.

“There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.”

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.

“I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “You can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but I don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.”

Trump’s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp’s preparation for two Trumps.

“We don’t want Donald Trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We’re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” Mook told NBC’s “Today.”

Asked about Clinton’s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that “it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.”

But Conway shot down the notion that there’s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that “Overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and Conway joined the pile-on.

“He’s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,” Conway said. “And that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.”

After Mook warned against “a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” Conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.”

“I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.”

Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.

“I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.

“What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,” Conway said. “Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.”

Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance.

“So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself — and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.

""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""

As the countdown to the next presidential debate inches closer, the tension between Hillary Clinton's campaign and Donald Trump's camp is palpable. With the stakes higher than ever, Clinton's team is urging voters and debate moderators alike to ensure that Trump does not evade accountability for his statements and actions. This call for vigilance comes amid a tightening race, where recent polls show Trump either neck-and-neck with Clinton or even leading in key battleground states.

Nate Silver, a prominent political analyst, has characterized the current electoral landscape as a ""dead heat,"" noting that Clinton's once-comfortable lead has dwindled to a mere 1%. This shift has heightened the urgency for both campaigns to strategize effectively for the upcoming debate, as every moment on stage could sway undecided voters.

In a bid to curb the spread of misinformation, Clinton's campaign has made a formal request to moderator Lester Holt to fact-check Trump in real time during the debate. This proposal reflects a broader concern among Democrats that Trump's propensity for falsehoods could go unchecked, potentially misleading the electorate.

However, Trump's campaign has reacted strongly to this request, with campaign manager Kellyanne Conway accusing Clinton's team of attempting to ""game the refs."" Conway has defended Trump's assertions regarding Holt's potential bias, positioning her candidate as a victim of a media landscape that she claims is stacked against him. This assertion resonates with many of Trump's supporters who believe that mainstream media outlets harbor an inherent bias against the Republican candidate.

Adding another layer to the debate dynamics, the Commission on Presidential Debates has weighed in on the issue of fact-checking, advising that moderators should refrain from interjecting during candidates' exchanges. Instead, the commission advocates for a format that allows candidates to address each other's statements without interference. This guideline aims to maintain the integrity of the debate format, ensuring that the focus remains on the candidates' direct interactions.

Clinton's press secretary has been vocal about the necessity of addressing Trump's repeated falsehoods, insisting that they should not go unchallenged. This sentiment underscores the strategic importance of the debate for Clinton, who aims to reinforce her credibility while simultaneously painting Trump as a candidate who cannot be trusted.

In contrast, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has argued that the moderator should remain a neutral party, avoiding any involvement that could detract from the candidates' dialogue. This perspective highlights a fundamental disagreement between the two campaigns regarding the role of the moderator and the flow of the debate.

As the campaigns prepare for the showdown, Trump's team is working diligently to shape public perception. They are portraying Clinton as robotic and overly scripted, while positioning Trump as a spontaneous and resilient figure who connects with voters on a personal level. This narrative aims to humanize Trump and draw a stark contrast to Clinton's more polished and rehearsed demeanor.

Conway has expressed particular concern over how the media might frame the debate, especially if Clinton chooses to leverage her gender as a focal point in her arguments. The implications of playing the ""woman card"" could lead to headlines that skew against Trump, a possibility that Conway is keen to avoid.

In a strategic move, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has advised Trump to embrace his authentic self during the debate, urging him not to get bogged down in a competition of detailed policy knowledge against Clinton. Giuliani's counsel reflects a broader strategy aimed at showcasing Trump's strengths as a relatable and straightforward candidate, rather than attempting to match Clinton's depth of policy expertise.

As both campaigns navigate the complexities of the upcoming debate, it is clear that the event will serve as a critical juncture in the election cycle. With the race tightening and the stakes escalating, the performances of both candidates could very well determine the trajectory of their campaigns in the weeks leading up to the election. The pressure is on for both Clinton and Trump to not only articulate their visions for the country but also to effectively counter the narratives being spun by their opponents.

As voters prepare to tune in, the anticipation surrounding the debate continues to build. The clash of ideas, personalities, and strategies will undoubtedly shape the political landscape, making the upcoming debate a pivotal moment in the race for the presidency.",-11.0,6.0,2057.0,-0.22,-0.0053475935828877,823.0,0.20689655172413793,0.007290400972053463
Real_19-Webpage,Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?,"I’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I’m pretty much baffled.

The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: “You’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.

Story Continued Below

Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that’s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”)

Further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).

By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump—bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post—but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump—and he's still standing.

Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history.

The Focus Is on “Moments”—But They’re Not Always The Key

Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:

“Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked Americans ‘are you better off?’ Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.”

These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It’s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “You’ve all become theater critics.”)

But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.

The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.

There Are Three Debates, Not One—And That Can Matter A Whole Lot

One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th—barely a week before the election.

Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That’s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.

Here, I think, is an opening for Clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).

Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo

The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.

“Well,” he said, “they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.”

Judo, however, can cut both ways. There’s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.

“Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.”

Debates Are NOT Decisive

One last note. It’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory.

In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.

Of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. So you’ll probably want to tune in anyway

As the 2024 presidential election looms closer, the anticipation surrounding the upcoming debates has reached a fever pitch. With extensive experience analyzing presidential debates, the author is keenly aware of the complex dynamics at play, particularly in the contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. While both candidates bring unique strengths to the table, the strategies they employ will be crucial in determining their success on the debate stage.

One of Clinton's most significant strengths is her extensive government experience. However, this very asset could be turned into a liability by Trump, who has shown a remarkable ability to reframe narratives to his advantage. The concept of ""political judo"" comes into play here; Trump has the potential to use Clinton's qualifications against her, framing her experience negatively and positioning himself as a fresh alternative to the status quo. This tactic could resonate with voters who are disillusioned with traditional political figures.

For Trump, reassuring college-educated white voters of his reasonableness will be essential. This demographic, which has shown increasing skepticism towards him, could be swayed by a strategy reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's approach in the 1980 election. By presenting himself as a rational and stable candidate, Trump could mitigate concerns about his temperament and policies, thereby gaining crucial support.

Clinton, on the other hand, faces significant challenges regarding her perceived honesty and trustworthiness. Trump is likely to capitalize on this vulnerability, bringing up criticisms from the FBI and media that have plagued Clinton throughout her political career. The narrative surrounding her integrity could overshadow her policy proposals and achievements, making it imperative for her to address these concerns head-on during the debates.

It's important to note that historical debate moments often overshadow the cumulative effect of candidates' performances. While certain exchanges may become iconic, the overall impression a candidate leaves on viewers can be more influential in shaping their perceptions. The upcoming debates consist of three separate events, providing both candidates with multiple opportunities to recover from any missteps or poor performances. This structure allows for a dynamic interplay where candidates can adapt their strategies based on the reactions and feedback they receive.

One potential avenue for Clinton to explore is the town hall debate format. This setting could enable her to connect more personally with voters, addressing their concerns directly while showcasing her proposals. By emphasizing her understanding of the issues that matter to everyday Americans, Clinton could create a stark contrast with Trump, who has often been criticized for his inconsistency on various issues. This approach could help to humanize her campaign and build trust with undecided voters.

However, it is essential to recognize that both candidates possess the ability to employ political judo against each other. Clinton could challenge Trump's claims regarding his business acumen, questioning the legitimacy of his successes and presenting a narrative that highlights the consequences of his policies. This back-and-forth could create a charged atmosphere in the debates, with each candidate attempting to undermine the other's credibility.

Despite the heightened focus on the debates, it's crucial to acknowledge that they are not always decisive in determining election outcomes. Factors such as economic performance, voter polarization, and broader electoral fundamentals often play a more significant role in shaping the final results. While the upcoming debate may be positioned as a critical moment in the campaign, its actual impact could be limited when viewed through the lens of these larger dynamics.

As both Clinton and Trump prepare for the debates, the stakes are undeniably high.

Real_2-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have',"Story highlights ""This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" Clinton said

The deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage in the election

Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.

""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.""

The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.

Her remarks were made during a campaign event in Orlando, following the deaths of Terence Crutcher and Keith Lamont Scott, which have sparked widespread outrage and protests across the nation.

During her speech, Clinton acknowledged the complexity of the situations, noting that there remains much unknown about the circumstances surrounding the deaths. However, she highlighted the troubling reality that these incidents have added two more names to the growing list of African Americans who have lost their lives at the hands of police. ""Too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" she stated, emphasizing the urgent need for change.

Clinton also addressed the public's response to these tragic events, urging individuals to refrain from directing their anger at police officers. As protests continue in reaction to the shootings, she called for a more constructive approach to addressing the underlying issues of racial injustice and police violence.

The deaths of Crutcher and Scott have reignited discussions about systemic racism and the need for police reform in the United States. Clinton's comments reflect a growing concern among many Americans regarding the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement and the urgent need for accountability.

As the nation grapples with these ongoing issues, Clinton's remarks serve as a reminder of the importance of dialogue and understanding in the pursuit of justice and equality.

Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton.

“The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?”

“I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.”

Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race.

“He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”

In a recent statement, Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential candidate, expressed his pride in providing an alternative to the mainstream options of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Johnson's comments come as the election heats up, with many voters feeling disillusioned by the two-party system.

Addressing concerns from Democrats about the potential for his candidacy to act as a spoiler, particularly in relation to Clinton's campaign, Johnson dismissed these worries. He asserted that voters who choose him are motivated by a genuine preference for his platform, rather than merely selecting a lesser evil. ""I would sleep well knowing I provide a first-choice option for voters,"" Johnson stated, underscoring his belief in the legitimacy of his candidacy.

Johnson also highlighted a notable trend in voter registration, revealing that 50% of new voters are identifying as independents. This statistic raises questions about the enduring dominance of only two major candidates in the electoral landscape. Johnson's remarks suggest a growing appetite for alternative political voices among the electorate.

Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, sought to downplay Johnson's potential impact on the election, referencing a recent poll that indicated Johnson's support had dipped to 5%. Mook's comments reflected a broader skepticism regarding the influence of third-party candidates, suggesting that neither Johnson nor others in the race would significantly alter the election's outcome.

As the election approaches, Johnson's campaign continues to advocate for a distinct choice for voters, while the major party candidates remain focused on their respective strategies to secure votes.",4.0,2.0,300.0,0.5,0.013333333333333334,300.0,0.18181818181818182,0.006666666666666667

Real_22-Webpage,Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.”

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.”

Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

The Senate reconvened this week with a renewed focus on transparency in presidential elections, as Democrats introduced a bill aimed at requiring candidates to disclose their tax returns. Spearheaded by Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the proposed legislation mandates that presidential candidates release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving their party’s nomination. This move is designed to ensure that voters have access to crucial financial information before casting their ballots.

Under the new proposal, if a candidate fails to comply with the requirement, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would be tasked with releasing the candidate’s tax documents after a 30-day period. This legislative initiative aims to bolster accountability and transparency in the electoral process, a principle that has been a topic of discussion for decades.

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) expressed optimism about the bill's prospects, indicating that the Senate could vote on the legislation in the near future. The push for transparency is not without precedent, as historical disclosures have become a significant aspect of presidential campaigns. Notably, both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have released over 30 years of tax returns, setting a standard for future candidates. In stark contrast, only one candidate since 1976, Gerald Ford, has not made his taxes public.

The issue of tax return disclosure gained heightened attention during the 2012 election cycle when former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid criticized Mitt Romney for releasing only two years of tax returns. Reid suggested that Romney was concealing information, a claim that gained traction when Bloomberg News reported a week before the election that Romney had significant income but had paid no taxes. This revelation seemed to validate Reid’s assertions and raised questions about the transparency of candidates' financial dealings.

In recent discussions, Minority Leader Harry Reid has labeled former President Donald Trump as “ethically compromised” and referred to him as “the king of the welfare kings.” Such statements underscore the importance of financial transparency in assessing a candidate's integrity and fitness for office. The tradition of financial disclosure in presidential campaigns can be traced back to George Romney, the father of Mitt Romney, further emphasizing the expectation that candidates will provide insight into their financial backgrounds.

As the Senate considers the proposed legislation, the article highlights the pressing need for voters to have access to Trump’s tax return details. This information is crucial for making informed decisions at the ballot box, particularly in light of ongoing discussions about Trump’s alleged financial improprieties. 

In addition to the push for transparency, there is a growing call for Congress to address Trump’s alleged crimes and consider the possibility of impeachment. The introduction of this bill represents a significant step towards ensuring that future presidential candidates uphold the tradition of financial disclosure, thereby fostering a more informed electorate. As the Senate prepares to deliberate on this critical issue, the outcome may have lasting implications for the integrity of the electoral process in the United States.",-9.0,11.0,496.0,-0.6428571428571429,-0.018145161290322582,566.0,0.5789473684210527,0.019434628975265017
Real_23-Webpage,Dem congressman to IRS: Audit the Trump Foundation,"Story highlights Trump reportedly used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes,"" Sander Levin wrote to the IRS

Washington (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen

The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.

The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.

This request comes in light of allegations that Trump utilized $258,000 from his charity to settle various lawsuits, raising concerns about the appropriateness of such financial maneuvers.

Levin underscored the principle that charitable funds should be dedicated to charitable purposes rather than being diverted for personal business interests. The Washington Post has detailed specific instances of this alleged misuse, including a $100,000 settlement paid to Palm Beach in 2007 and an additional $158,000 related to a lawsuit concerning a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament in 2011.

These revelations have sparked accusations of self-dealing against Trump from Democratic lawmakers, who argue that the actions represent a significant breach of trust in the management of charitable contributions. 

In a related political context, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has advised Hillary Clinton's campaign to refrain from leveraging these allegations for political gain. He cautioned that while the situation is serious, it should be approached with careful consideration to avoid potential backlash.

Real_24-Webpage,Armed Intruders Break in House…Armed Resident Responds – Eagle Rising,"Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun.

The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway.

After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away.

In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.”

Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.”

ATLANTA – A dramatic home invasion unfolded early Thursday morning at a resident's house in Atlanta when three armed men broke in around 4:00 AM. The situation escalated quickly, leading to a confrontation that was captured on surveillance cameras installed at the property.

During the incident, a co-worker of the homeowner, who was present for work, took decisive action by drawing a handgun in response to the intruders. The footage shows the co-worker firing all rounds at the armed men, successfully forcing them to flee the scene. Tragically, one of the intruders sustained fatal gunshot wounds and was found dead in the driveway.

The two remaining suspects managed to escape and are currently at large. Authorities are actively investigating the case and have expressed hope that the clear surveillance video will aid in identifying these individuals, who were notably not wearing masks during the break-in.

Following the harrowing experience, the homeowner took steps to calm his co-worker and retrieved the firearm. Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington spoke on the matter, emphasizing the co-worker's right to defend property in such dangerous situations. He also remarked on the rarity of having such detailed surveillance footage available from a home invasion, which could prove crucial in the ongoing investigation.

Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.

“They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.”

Story Continued Below

Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.

“I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.”

“Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.”

Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.

""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.

“I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""

While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.

“I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”

Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado.

“I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”

In a post-debate analysis, former President Donald Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with the moderation of Lester Holt during the recent debate, labeling the questioning as unfair and biased. Trump argued that Holt's focus was disproportionately on him, neglecting to address significant issues surrounding his opponent, Hillary Clinton. 

Trump's critique centered on what he perceived as an imbalance in Holt's questioning. He pointed out that while he had been repeatedly asked about his tax returns, Holt failed to bring up pressing matters related to Clinton's past, including her controversial emails and the Benghazi incident. This perceived lack of scrutiny toward Clinton's record became a focal point in Trump's post-debate remarks.

In evaluating Holt's performance, Trump assigned a grade of C+ for moderation. He acknowledged that some of Holt's initial questions were satisfactory, but he took issue with the later inquiries, particularly those concerning a housing discrimination lawsuit. Trump's campaign team, which included prominent figures like Vice President Mike Pence and senior advisor Kellyanne Conway, echoed his sentiments. They expressed disappointment over Holt's decision to avoid key issues that directly pertained to Clinton, suggesting that the debate was not a fair platform for either candidate.

Adding to the drama of the debate, Trump claimed he encountered technical difficulties with his microphone, insinuating that it may have been tampered with to undermine his performance. This assertion raised eyebrows and added another layer of controversy to an already charged political atmosphere.

As the debate progressed, Trump acknowledged that Clinton succeeded in provoking him, particularly when she brought up Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe contestant. Machado has been a point of contention for Trump, as he had previously made disparaging remarks about her during her time in the pageant. In response to Clinton's mention of Machado, Trump defended his past comments by asserting that she had been a challenging contestant. 

The discussion surrounding Machado highlighted the personal nature of the debate, as Trump found himself on the defensive. Despite the tensions, he maintained that his remarks were justified, framing them within the context of the competition rather than as personal attacks. 

As the fallout from the debate continues, Trump's criticisms of Holt and his defense of his past comments reflect a broader strategy of deflection and counterattack that has characterized his political style. The debate not only served as a platform for policy discussion but also as a battleground for personal narratives and historical grievances, setting the stage for the ongoing campaign. 

Overall, Trump's post-debate commentary underscores the contentious nature of the political landscape as both candidates navigate their respective narratives in the lead-up to the election.",-41.0,-27.0,1119.0,-1.025,-0.03663985701519214,503.0,-1.4210526315789473,-0.0536779324055666

In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.

Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.

From the Daily Mail:

National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.

A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.

On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street.

After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.

A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is witnessing a second consecutive night of violent protests ignited by the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an armed black suspect, by a black police officer, Brentley Vinson. The incident has led to widespread unrest, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency in response to the escalating violence and chaos that has enveloped the city.

The protests, initially sparked by demands for justice and accountability, have taken a dark turn, resulting in significant injuries and destruction. A protester is currently in critical condition after being shot in the head by another protester and is now on life support. This alarming incident highlights the dangers present within the demonstrations, which have also seen three additional protesters and four police officers injured amid the turmoil.

As tensions continue to rise, there have been alarming reports of attempts to harm journalists covering the events. A cameraman and a reporter have been attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed live on air, raising serious concerns about the safety of media personnel in the midst of the unrest. The hostility towards reporters has created an environment of fear, complicating the dissemination of information to the public.

The violence has not only affected individuals but has also led to significant property damage. The NASCAR Hall of Fame, along with several other businesses in the area, has been vandalized, prompting major companies to advise their employees to steer clear of the affected zones. The damage inflicted on local businesses underscores the broader implications of the protests, as the community grapples with the fallout from the unrest.

In light of the deteriorating situation, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is contemplating the implementation of a curfew to restore order. The mayor's decision comes as the city grapples with the dual challenges of addressing the grievances that sparked the protests and managing the violence that has ensued. Some protesters have voiced their frustration with the violent turn of events, emphasizing that the original message of the protests—demanding justice for Keith Lamont Scott—has been overshadowed by the chaos.

The protests have seen a mix of emotions, with some participants engaging in destructive behavior, including breaking windows and looting. This has created a divide among protesters, with some advocating for peaceful demonstrations while others resort to violence. The police have responded to the unrest by deploying flash grenades and tear gas to disperse crowds that have been throwing objects at them, escalating the confrontations between law enforcement and demonstrators.

Concerns are mounting regarding the potential for ongoing unrest in Charlotte. The violence and destruction have overshadowed the original intent of the protests, raising questions about how the community can effectively address the issues at hand while also ensuring public safety. The situation remains fluid, and the city is bracing for further developments as tensions continue to simmer.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of the shooting and the subsequent protests, the community is left to ponder the path forward. The need for dialogue and understanding is more pressing than ever, as residents seek to navigate the complexities of race, justice, and public safety in a time of crisis. The hope is that amidst the chaos, a constructive conversation can emerge that honors the memory of Keith Lamont Scott while also addressing the underlying issues that have led to such unrest.

The coming days will be crucial for Charlotte as it seeks to restore order and find a way to heal from the wounds inflicted by both the shooting and the violent protests that have followed. The city stands at a crossroads, with the potential for meaningful change intertwined with the urgent need for peace and stability.",-82.0,-75.0,674.0,-2.484848484848485,-0.12166172106824925,680.0,-3.0,-0.11029411764705882

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked Rouhani whether he'd rather work with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. Rouhani said, ""Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.

Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.

Rouhani highlighted that the JCPOA is an international agreement, which was passed unanimously by the United Nations Security Council, underscoring its legitimacy and global consensus. He pointed out that Trump's criticism of the deal, labeling it a ""bad deal,"" reflects a desire to dismantle it, alongside a broader critique of the Obama administration's approach to Iran.

Real_28-Webpage,“How Can we LEAD When we Can’t Even Control Our Own Cities?” [VIDEO] – Eagle Rising,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said:

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.

“Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.

“Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?

“We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.

“Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.

“The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.

“There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.

“Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.”

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – In a speech delivered on Thursday, former President Donald Trump addressed the ongoing national unrest that has followed a series of officer-involved shootings across the United States. Speaking to a crowd gathered in the city, Trump emphasized the urgent need for unity and togetherness among Americans, urging citizens to come together in the face of adversity.

Trump began his remarks by reflecting on the importance of shared values, citing historical achievements that have been made possible through collective effort. ""When we unite, we can overcome any challenge,"" he stated, calling for a renewed commitment to understanding diverse perspectives and working collaboratively towards healing the nation. 

The former president did not shy away from addressing the unrest that has erupted in various cities, particularly highlighting the situation in Charlotte. He expressed concern that such disturbances create a negative image for the United States, undermining its position as a global leader. ""We cannot allow our cities to be marred by chaos; it sends a message that we are not in control,"" Trump said.

While affirming the right to peaceful protest, Trump was clear in his condemnation of violent disruptions that threaten public safety. ""All Americans deserve to live in safe communities,"" he asserted, calling for an end to violence that affects both citizens and law enforcement personnel. He pointed out that the impact of riots disproportionately affects law-abiding African-American residents, who often face dire consequences in terms of jobs, housing, and education due to the unrest.

Trump underscored the government's primary duty to protect the well-being and safety of all communities, stating that lawlessness cannot be tolerated. ""Crime and violence harm the poor the most, and we must prioritize the safety and comfort of families over those who choose to engage in violent disruptions,"" he declared. His remarks resonated with many in the audience who echoed his concerns about the implications of unrest on everyday life.

The former president's speech comes at a time when tensions remain high across the nation, with many grappling with the complexities of social justice issues and the right to protest. Trump's call for understanding and unity is an appeal to bridge the divides that have emerged in recent months. He urged Americans to reflect on their shared humanity and work together to restore peace and stability in their communities.

As Trump concluded his address, he reiterated his commitment to fostering an environment where every American feels safe and respected. His focus on community safety and the well-being of families is a central theme that he hopes will resonate as the nation navigates through these challenging times. 

In Pittsburgh, the former president's message of unity and safety struck a chord, as many attendees expressed their desire for a return to normalcy and a collective effort to address the root causes of unrest. With the nation at a crossroads, Trump's call for healing and understanding may serve as a rallying point for those seeking to mend the fractures that have emerged in recent months.",-5.0,-6.0,540.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.009259259259259259,575.0,-0.3,-0.010434782608695653
Real_29-Webpage,9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him,"""Donald, you’re a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him

Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.

That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father.

Story Continued Below

1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection

In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.”

“The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’”

2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward”

Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.”

“It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said.

3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully”

“Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said . “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.”

4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women”

Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.”

5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky”

In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.”

6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth”

Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.”

7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said

“I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said .

8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer”

Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’

And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.”

9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family

“I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.

Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.

In a surprising turn of events, Senator Ted Cruz has officially endorsed former President Donald Trump, just two months after facing backlash at the Republican National Convention for failing to show his support. This endorsement marks a significant shift for Cruz, who has spent months publicly criticizing Trump, particularly in response to the former president's attacks on his family.

Cruz’s endorsement comes on the heels of a tumultuous relationship with Trump, characterized by a series of insults and accusations that Cruz hurled at the former president. The senator had previously speculated that Trump’s tax returns could reveal connections to organized crime, suggesting that Trump was hiding something significant from the public. This assertion was part of a broader narrative Cruz constructed, painting Trump as a figure shrouded in mystery and dishonesty.

In a particularly heated exchange, Cruz labeled Trump a “sniveling coward” for allegedly threatening to attack his wife, Heidi. This personal attack struck a nerve for Cruz, who has consistently maintained that family is off-limits in political discourse. He further characterized Trump as a “big, loud New York bully,” criticizing him for his penchant for attacking family members of political opponents. Cruz’s remarks underscored a deep-seated resentment toward Trump, which had been festering since the early days of their rivalry.

Moreover, Cruz did not shy away from making sweeping judgments about Trump’s character. He described Trump as “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women,” a comment that seemed to reflect his own frustrations with the former president’s behavior. Cruz’s criticisms extended beyond personal attacks, as he dismissed Trump’s theories regarding his father’s alleged involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as “nuts” and “kooky.” This dismissal highlighted Cruz’s view of Trump as someone who often veers into the realm of conspiracy rather than sticking to factual discourse.

Cruz’s portrayal of Trump took a sharper turn when he branded him a “pathological liar.” This accusation, which Cruz reiterated multiple times, suggested that Trump not only lies frequently but also projects his own dishonesty onto others. Cruz emphasized the “pathological” nature of Trump’s behavior, claiming that he is “utterly amoral” in his actions and decisions. Such characterizations painted a picture of a man who, in Cruz’s eyes, lacks the moral compass necessary for leadership.

In addition to questioning Trump’s integrity, Cruz accused him of narcissism, labeling him a “serial philanderer” who takes pride in his exploits. This accusation added another layer to Cruz’s critique, suggesting that Trump’s personal life and character flaws were not just private matters but indicative of a broader issue with his suitability for public office.

Despite Cruz’s previous declarations of not supporting someone who attacks his family, the endorsement marks a notable pivot in his stance. In July, Cruz had publicly stated that he could not support a candidate who resorts to personal attacks against his loved ones. This sentiment resonated with many of Cruz’s supporters, who viewed his commitment to family values as a cornerstone of his political identity.

The endorsement raises questions about Cruz’s motivations and the political landscape within the Republican Party. Many speculate that Cruz’s change of heart may be rooted in a desire to align himself with the frontrunner for the 2024 presidential election, as Trump continues to command a significant following among Republican voters. By endorsing Trump, Cruz may be attempting to secure his own political future, positioning himself as a loyal ally within a party that has largely rallied around the former president.

This endorsement also reflects the complex dynamics at play within the Republican Party, where loyalty and personal relationships often intersect with political ambition. Cruz’s previous criticisms of Trump may have alienated some of his supporters, and by endorsing Trump now, he could be seeking to mend fences and re-establish his standing within the party.

As the 2024 election cycle approaches, Cruz’s endorsement of Trump will likely have implications for both their political careers and the broader Republican landscape. The endorsement could galvanize Trump’s base, solidifying his position as the leading candidate for the nomination. Conversely, it may also prompt backlash from those within the party who feel betrayed by Cruz’s sudden shift in allegiance.

In conclusion, Ted Cruz’s endorsement of Donald Trump marks a significant development in the ongoing saga of their tumultuous relationship. From harsh criticisms to staunch support, Cruz’s journey reflects the complexities of loyalty and ambition within the Republican Party. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the ramifications of this endorsement will undoubtedly be felt in the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Whether this alliance will strengthen Cruz’s position or lead to further scrutiny remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the relationship between these two political figures is far from straightforward.",-40.0,6.0,974.0,-1.2903225806451613,-0.04106776180698152,947.0,0.1875,0.006335797254487857

Washington (CNN)

Few counties could prove more decisive in this election than Wake County, North Carolina.

A historically competitive county whose fortunes are on the rise, Wake could help deliver Hillary Clinton a win in a key battleground state -- or dash her hopes for the presidency. Simply put, if Clinton performs well in the highly educated research triangle, then election night bodes well for her. If Wake County doesn't come out for Clinton, Donald Trump's path to the White House would grow much clearer.

The county is rapidly expanding, and the influx of new people and industries could reshape the race. Meanwhile, the turmoil across the state in Charlotte after a police officer shot and killed a black man could add another focal point in the election — search data from Google Trends shows Wake County's spiking interest in ""police brutality"" this week.

Keep your eye on Wake County, and take a look at the fundamentals below.

Population

Wake County is fairly representative of the country in terms of race and ethnicity, but it has a more highly educated population, bigger incomes and a better job picture than the rest of the nation.

President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

“What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.”

“That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.

The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.

“Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”

At the White House Tribal Nations Conference, President Barack Obama made headlines by breaking an unofficial rule against presidential headgear. During his remarks, he was presented with a hat and a blanket from Native American leaders, a gesture he appreciated deeply.

In a lighthearted moment, Obama donned the blanket around his shoulders, showcasing a blend of respect and humor. However, he quickly removed the hat, adhering to the longstanding tradition that discourages presidents from wearing unusual headgear. This unspoken rule has its roots in the infamous helmet incident involving former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, which has since become a cautionary tale in political circles.

Reflecting on his eight years in office, Obama took the opportunity to express gratitude for the friendships he has developed with Native American communities. He even joked about the blanket, mentioning that he would need to secure one for First Lady Michelle Obama to prevent her from claiming his. This personal touch highlighted the warmth and camaraderie that has characterized his interactions with tribal leaders.

Obama's acknowledgment of the headgear rule dates back to a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy football team, where he humorously remarked, ""You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president."" This incident at the Tribal Nations Conference, however, showcased his willingness to embrace cultural symbols while navigating the delicate balance of presidential decorum.

As the conference concluded, Obama’s actions served as a reminder of the importance of honoring traditions and fostering relationships, even in the face of long-standing protocols. His unique approach to the event has left a lasting impression on attendees, reinforcing the significance of cultural exchange in his administration.",17.0,20.0,327.0,1.4166666666666667,0.05198776758409786,323.0,1.6666666666666667,0.06191950464396285

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.

“Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.”

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.”

“We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.

Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”

But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.

“I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.

As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

In a passionate appeal to voters, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the monumental significance of the upcoming election, asserting that it will shape the trajectory of America for the next 50 years, not merely the immediate future. Speaking during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton urged black voters to actively participate in the electoral process, highlighting the importance of their voices in determining the nation's direction.

Clinton articulated that every issue that resonates with voters is at stake in this election cycle. She underscored the urgency of the next 50 days, calling them critical for mobilizing support and ensuring that voters are prepared to make their voices heard. ""We are at a crossroads, and the choices we make now will echo for decades,"" she stated, emphasizing the weight of the upcoming decisions.

In her interview, Clinton encouraged listeners to verify their voter registration status and provided resources to assist them in this process. ""Make sure you are registered to vote—your participation is crucial,"" she implored. This call to action comes as many Americans prepare for a pivotal election that could redefine the political landscape.

Clinton's remarks followed a significant speech by former President Barack Obama, who also highlighted the various societal issues that will be on the ballot. The convergence of these messages from prominent Democratic figures underscores a concerted effort to galvanize voter turnout, particularly among demographics that have historically faced challenges in the electoral process.

As the political climate heats up, the first presidential debate between Clinton and her opponent, Donald Trump, is set to take place on Monday in New York. This debate is anticipated to be a defining moment in the campaign, as both candidates will have the opportunity to present their visions for the country and address pressing issues that concern voters.

Throughout her interview, Clinton expressed her determination to communicate her message clearly, despite the barrage of insults and attacks she has faced from Trump. She condemned Trump's derogatory remarks directed at various groups, including African-Americans, immigrants, and women, asserting that such rhetoric has no place in American politics. ""We need to rise above the insults and focus on the issues that matter,"" Clinton remarked, reinforcing her commitment to a campaign grounded in respect and progress.

In a swift response to Clinton's interview, Trump took to Twitter to mock her, suggesting that she was taking a day off before the impending debate. This exchange highlights the contentious nature of the campaign, where personal attacks and public jabs have become commonplace.

As the election draws nearer, the stakes are higher than ever, with both candidates gearing up for a battle that will not only influence the immediate political landscape but also shape the future of the nation. Clinton's call to action for voter participation serves as a reminder of the power of the electorate and the importance of every individual's voice in shaping America's future.",7.0,16.0,524.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013358778625954198,562.0,0.8421052631578947,0.028469750889679714

I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps.

This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.

Story Continued Below

So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.

Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.

Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as “another Hitler.” She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.

In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.

That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.

It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin’s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did—an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing Russians,” a doubly illegal act of war.

Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.

***

John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, “Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.” Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.

But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.” Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.”

Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.

“Our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.”

He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. “All this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.”

John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.

The legacy of JFK & RFK is “being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party.”

Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.

Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.

Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.

Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime “existential” threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be “existential” enemy.

There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.

Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.”

Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.

But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.

For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.

And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.

***

So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.

We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.

President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future.

Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.

But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.

Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.

Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “There can be no business as usual with Russia.”

Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.

And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:

Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.

Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.

Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.

This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.

Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.

Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.

Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

In a surprising revelation, a lifelong Democrat and former aide to the iconic Kennedy brothers, John and Robert, has announced his decision to cast his vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. This bold choice reflects a profound shift in the author’s political stance, rooted in a critical examination of the current Democratic Party’s trajectory and its implications for American foreign policy.

The author highlights a stark transformation within the Democratic Party, which he now perceives as the ""Party of War."" He contrasts this with the peace-focused legacy of the Kennedys, who famously advocated for diplomacy and conflict resolution over military intervention. The author recalls the Kennedys’ commitment to peace during some of the most tumultuous periods in American history, emphasizing their efforts to prevent war and promote understanding among nations.

Central to the author's critique is the extensive U.S. military presence across the globe. He points out that American military bases are established in 80 countries, with personnel deployed in 130 nations. This expansive military footprint, he argues, often leads to military action being the first response to conflicts, rather than pursuing diplomatic solutions. The author laments that this approach not only undermines the principles of peace but also entangles the United States in prolonged conflicts with unclear objectives.

A significant portion of the author's critique is directed at Hillary Clinton, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party. He condemns her aggressive foreign policy stance, particularly her advocacy for military intervention in various global hotspots and her role in fostering a hostile relationship with Russia. The author argues that such a confrontational approach is counterproductive and detrimental to both national and global security.

In stark contrast, the author posits that Donald Trump stands out as the only candidate willing to advocate for diplomatic relations with Russia and China, particularly in the context of combating terrorism. He argues that Trump's willingness to engage with these nations could pave the way for collaborative efforts to address shared threats, thereby enhancing global stability.

While acknowledging Trump's flaws—an admission that adds nuance to his endorsement—the author expresses admiration for Trump's political courage. He commends Trump for challenging the entrenched war hawks and mainstream media narratives that have dominated American politics for decades. This boldness, the author argues, is essential for fostering a new approach to foreign policy that prioritizes dialogue over conflict.

Reflecting on the legacy of the Kennedys, the author underscores their unwavering commitment to peace and their strategic efforts to avert war during critical moments, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. He draws parallels between their vision and the current need for a re-evaluation of American military engagements, particularly in the Middle East. The author critiques ongoing military interventions, questioning the clarity of objectives and the prospects for achieving lasting victory in these conflicts.

In addition to foreign policy, the author emphasizes the importance of prioritizing domestic issues. He advocates for a focus on community safety and better-trained police forces, arguing that these elements are crucial for fostering peace at home. The author suggests that a shift in U.S. foreign policy is necessary to avoid unnecessary wars and to foster cooperation with nations like Russia and China in the fight against terrorism.

As he articulates his vision for a more peaceful and diplomatic approach to international relations, the author expresses hope for a return to the wisdom of America’s founding principles. He advocates for a focus on national interests and domestic peace, suggesting that these ideals align closely with Trump’s platform. The author believes that embracing these principles could provide a potential path away from the cycle of endless war and towards more rational and constructive foreign relations.

In conclusion, the author’s decision to support Donald Trump represents a significant departure from traditional party lines, driven by a desire for peace and diplomacy. By invoking the legacy of the Kennedys and critiquing the current state of American foreign policy, he presents a compelling case for a new direction—one that prioritizes dialogue, cooperation, and a commitment to resolving conflicts without resorting to military action. As the election approaches, this perspective invites a broader conversation about the future of American politics and the role of diplomacy in an increasingly complex world.",-120.0,22.0,3840.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.03125,797.0,0.7586206896551724,0.027603513174404015

As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.

Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.

From the Independent Review Journal:

But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:

People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474655224000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer4.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer1.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer2.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer3.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer5.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters."", ""title"": ""NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte - But It Wasn't To Protest The National Anthem... | John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 750, ""identifier"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg"", ""height"": 563}, ""url"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""always"", ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 1631890973779575, ""pages"": 389658314427637}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Black Lives Matter"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-23T14:27:04-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/terresamonroe""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- NC State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters, contrasting with protests against police actions.

In a powerful display of faith and community, North Carolina State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters, a stark contrast to the ongoing demonstrations against police actions. This act of solidarity and reflection was captured in a viral photo shared by the North Carolina Troopers Association, showcasing officers who prioritize prayer in their efforts to serve and protect the community.

The backdrop to this poignant moment was the unrest following the officer-involved shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which ignited protests across the nation. While radical groups were reportedly bused into Charlotte with the intent to incite chaos, the local community's response, characterized by prayers and peaceful gatherings, played a crucial role in maintaining order during a volatile time. The presence of local prayers not only helped keep the protests mostly peaceful but also served as a reminder of the power of faith in fostering unity.

In the wake of the turmoil, the Troopers Association emphasized the importance of supporting officers who are dedicated to protecting the community and contributing to its rebuilding efforts. They called for solidarity among citizens, urging them to recognize the hard work and sacrifices made by law enforcement personnel in the face of adversity.

The kneeling prayers were not confined to Charlotte alone; similar demonstrations of unity were witnessed across the country, including in Memphis. These acts of kneeling prayer transcended racial divides, highlighting a collective desire for healing and understanding in a time marked by division and strife.

Critics of the unrest have pointed to the influence of radical ideologies, suggesting that rioters are often manipulated by external forces rather than motivated by genuine concerns. This perspective underscores the need for faith as a tool to overcome such divisions, reinforcing the idea that community solidarity can act as a counterbalance to chaos.

Adding to the positive atmosphere in Charlotte was the presence of the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team, known for their commitment to providing emotional and spiritual support during crises. Their involvement served as a beacon of hope, reinforcing the message that compassion and understanding can prevail even in the most challenging circumstances.

The author of this article expressed pride in the police officers who chose to prioritize prayer over violence, illustrating a commitment to peace and community engagement. In contrast, there is a pointed criticism of movements like Black Lives Matter, which the author argues promote division rather than unity. This perspective suggests that while the movement aims to address systemic issues, it may inadvertently deepen societal rifts.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to evolve, the actions of the State Troopers and the community's response serve as a reminder of the importance of prayer and unity in the face of adversity. The image of officers kneeling in prayer stands as a testament to the belief that faith can bridge divides and foster a sense of togetherness, even amidst chaos.

In a time when tensions are high and divisions seem insurmountable, the call for unity through prayer and community engagement resonates deeply. The actions taken by the North Carolina State Troopers not only reflect their dedication to their duties but also their commitment to the values of faith and community, offering a hopeful narrative in an otherwise tumultuous landscape.",3.0,31.0,580.0,0.1,0.005172413793103448,604.0,1.55,0.05132450331125828

Real_35-Webpage,Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games.

Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.

Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.

""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.

While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.

During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!""

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

""As of now I plan to keep kneeling,"" she told ESPN. ""I'm trying to kind of formulate a better plan and an action step moving forward.

U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe may soon face disciplinary action after kneeling during the national anthem in a recent match. The incident occurred during the U.S. team’s game against the Netherlands on September 18, where Rapinoe took a knee to protest against injustice and oppression in the United States. This act of defiance has sparked significant controversy, particularly among officials at U.S. Soccer.

U.S. Soccer has made it clear that coaches and players are expected to stand during the national anthem as a show of respect for the flag. The organization expressed that Rapinoe's protest contradicts its core values, emphasizing the importance of honoring the flag during the anthem. While Rapinoe has not yet faced immediate punishment for her actions, U.S. Soccer has indicated that her situation will be reassessed if she continues to kneel.

Rapinoe's decision to kneel is rooted in her solidarity with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who famously protested against police brutality and racial prejudice. By taking a knee, Rapinoe aims to raise awareness about ongoing injustices in the U.S. and to use her platform as a professional athlete to advocate for change.

The backlash from fans during the match against the Netherlands was palpable, with some expressing their disapproval vocally. One fan was heard urging her to ""Stand up!"" highlighting the division her protest has created among supporters. Despite this criticism, Rapinoe remains resolute in her stance, stating that she plans to continue her protest regardless of the potential for suspension. She views her actions as a vital expression of her beliefs and a way to be an ally to those who are marginalized.

As the situation unfolds, the implications of Rapinoe's protest are being closely monitored by both U.S. Soccer and the public. The intersection of sports and activism continues to provoke discussion and debate, with Rapinoe at the forefront of this dialogue. Her commitment to using her voice for social justice underscores the growing trend of athletes leveraging their platforms to advocate for change.

In summary, Megan Rapinoe's kneeling during the national anthem has ignited a firestorm of controversy, with U.S. Soccer asserting that such actions are not in line with the organization's expectations. As she prepares to maintain her protest, the sports world watches closely to see how this situation will develop.",0.0,-2.0,421.0,0.0,0.0,436.0,-0.1111111111111111,-0.0045871559633027525

It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed.

Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing.

Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.

Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.”

Below is the offending post:

“I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??”

After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.

Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people.

Brody Jenner, the son of Caitlyn Jenner and Linda Thompson, has found himself at the center of controversy following recent comments made on Twitter. The reality star, who rose to fame through the popular series ""The Hills,"" sparked a heated debate with his remarks regarding race and law enforcement.

In a tweet that many deemed insensitive, Jenner stated that not everything is about race and echoed the phrase ""All Lives Matter."" This sentiment, often criticized for undermining the Black Lives Matter movement, led to significant backlash from various individuals who accused him of insensitivity given his privileged background. Critics pointed out that his race, gender, and sexual orientation played a role in their perception of his comments, labeling him a ""terrible person"" for his stance.

Jenner's post did not stop at the phrase that ignited the uproar; he further emphasized the importance of complying with police orders, arguing that such compliance should be expected regardless of an individual's race. He questioned the logic of exiting a vehicle while armed, suggesting that individuals should clearly communicate their lack of weapons to officers in potentially tense situations. His comments, however, did not resonate well with many, as they felt they dismissed the complexities surrounding race relations and police interactions in America.

The backlash was swift and fierce, with many users taking to social media to express their discontent. Critics highlighted the need for a more nuanced understanding of the systemic issues surrounding race and policing, arguing that Jenner’s comments oversimplified a deeply rooted societal problem. 

Despite the mounting criticism, Jenner appeared undeterred. He continued to post on Instagram, where his content further provoked ire from liberal commentators. His decision to maintain his stance in the face of backlash has only fueled the fire, with many questioning his understanding of the issues at hand.

The situation has ignited discussions about the responsibilities of public figures in addressing sensitive topics such as race and law enforcement. Jenner's comments serve as a reminder of the complexities involved in these discussions and the potential repercussions of oversimplifying such critical issues.

As the discourse surrounding his statements continues, it remains to be seen how Jenner will navigate the fallout from his comments and whether he will address the concerns raised by his critics. The incident underscores a broader societal conversation about race, privilege, and the responsibility of individuals in positions of influence to engage thoughtfully with pressing social issues.",-17.0,-29.0,476.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.03571428571428571,466.0,-1.7058823529411764,-0.06223175965665236

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.”

Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past.

Story Continued Below

“Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.”

The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].”

Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.”

“I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”

In a poignant address, Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, publicly criticized former President Donald Trump for his failure to apologize for his role in the controversial ""birther"" movement, which questioned the citizenship of former President Barack Obama. Brazile described Trump's actions as a ""wound that won't heal,"" drawing attention to the painful history of racism that continues to affect many Americans.

Brazile's comments came during her visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, a site that serves as a powerful reminder of the struggles faced by African Americans throughout history. Reflecting on her family's own history, Brazile emphasized the importance of documentation and recognition of the past, particularly the harrowing experiences of her ancestors who endured the horrors of slavery.

The interim chairwoman urged Trump to fully comprehend the impact of his comments regarding Obama’s birth certificate, which have resurfaced repeatedly in political discourse. She expressed her deep frustration over Trump's unwillingness to acknowledge the pain and division his words have caused, particularly within the context of America's ongoing racial struggles.

In a recent presidential debate, Trump deflected responsibility for the birther issue, attributing its origins to Hillary Clinton and claiming credit for Obama eventually releasing his birth certificate. This deflection has only intensified Brazile's call for accountability and reconciliation. She noted that Trump's actions have not only perpetuated a cycle of racial pain but have also exploited the wounds of history for political gain.

Despite her earnest appeals, Brazile acknowledged the likelihood of receiving an apology from Trump is slim. This reality underscores her frustration with the persistent racial exploitation that plagues the nation. As she reflected on the past and its implications for the present, Brazile's remarks serve as a reminder of the work that remains in addressing racial injustices and fostering understanding.

Brazile's call for an apology is not merely a personal grievance; it resonates with a broader demand for accountability among public figures who wield significant influence over societal narratives. The birther movement, which has been widely criticized for its racist undertones, represents a troubling chapter in American political history. By refusing to take responsibility for his role in this movement, Trump has left many feeling that the wounds of racism remain unaddressed.

The significance of Brazile's visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture cannot be overstated. The museum serves as a vital space for reflection and education, highlighting the historical context of racial issues in America. Brazile's emphasis on the struggles of her ancestors reinforces the need for ongoing dialogue about race and identity in the United States.

As the nation grapples with its complex history, Brazile's call for an apology from Trump highlights the importance of accountability and healing. The wounds of the past, she argues, cannot be ignored, and the dialogue surrounding them must continue. Whether or not Trump chooses to acknowledge the impact of his words, the conversation about race and responsibility is far from over. Brazile's remarks are a clarion call for reflection, understanding, and, ultimately, a path toward healing the divisions that have long plagued the nation.",-17.0,-33.0,540.0,-1.0,-0.03148148148148148,606.0,-1.5,-0.054455445544554455
Real_38-Webpage,US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike,"(CNN) The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.

Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials.

That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.

Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.

But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

In a tragic incident on Saturday, a US-led coalition mistakenly bombed a Syrian military position, resulting in the deaths of over 60 personnel near Deir Ezzor. The coalition, which included US, British, Danish, and Australian aircraft, reportedly used drones in the strike, as confirmed by the UK Ministry of Defence.

Initial assessments suggest that the bombing may have occurred due to the personnel not wearing military uniforms and lacking standard military weapons, leading to confusion regarding their identity. US defense officials speculate that the individuals targeted might have been Syrian military prisoners.

While US officials have acknowledged that Syrian personnel were hit, they have yet to reach final conclusions about the identities of those struck. Ongoing investigations will include overhead imagery analysis and interviews with those involved in the operation. The US is actively looking into the misidentification that led to this tragic event, emphasizing the need for thorough evaluations in future operations.",-15.0,-10.0,178.0,-1.6666666666666667,-0.08426966292134831,183.0,-1.4285714285714286,-0.0546448087431694

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

“This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.”

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

“If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.”

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

“That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.”

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

In a bold move during the Emmy Awards ceremony, host Jimmy Kimmel took the opportunity to deliver pointed criticism of former President Donald Trump and his supporters, captivating a large audience with his biting humor. Kicking off the evening, Kimmel made light of Hollywood's elite and the industry's ongoing efforts towards embracing diversity, highlighting the impressive array of nominees that showcased a broad spectrum of talent.

With his trademark sarcasm, Kimmel drew attention to what he perceives as Hollywood's penchant for self-congratulation, questioning the true value placed on diversity within the industry. His commentary set a tone that was both entertaining and thought-provoking, prompting laughter and reflection among the audience.

In a particularly memorable moment, Kimmel turned his focus to Trump, suggesting that the former president's prominence in politics is largely attributable to his connection with television. ""Without television,"" Kimmel quipped, ""Trump would not be a presidential candidate but rather at home with his wife."" This remark underscored Kimmel's belief that the media landscape played a significant role in elevating Trump's profile and shaping his political journey.

Kimmel did not stop there; he specifically pointed fingers at Mark Burnett, the creator of the reality television show ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" which famously launched Trump into the spotlight. Kimmel humorously placed the blame for Trump's rise to fame and subsequent presidency squarely on Burnett's shoulders, implying that the show's success paved the way for Trump's political aspirations.

In a comedic twist, Kimmel nominated Burnett for a figurative sacrifice over Trump's proposed wall, further emphasizing the absurdity of the current political climate. This satirical suggestion served as a rallying cry for viewers to consider the implications of reality television on contemporary politics.

Kimmel's opening remarks not only entertained but also sparked conversations about the intersection of entertainment and politics, shedding light on how figures from Hollywood can influence the political landscape. As the Emmys unfolded, it was clear that Kimmel's commentary resonated with many, making a memorable statement about the state of reality in politics today.",13.0,20.0,391.0,0.7222222222222222,0.03324808184143223,399.0,1.5384615384615385,0.05012531328320802

Real_41-Webpage,Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business',"During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump’s debate performance Monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.""

Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""

""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'You’re fired.' They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.""

During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way.""

""When you’re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump.

The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart.""

""He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.

""If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord,"" Biden said about the debate. ""What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.""",http://abcn.ws/2d3YEVr,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"Abc News,More Arlette",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382,"{""fb_title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""description"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@arlettesaenz"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:43:23"", ""keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate""}","- Vice President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's debate performance during a rally in Philadelphia.

In a spirited rally held in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden did not hold back in his criticism of Donald Trump’s recent debate performance. Addressing a crowd of enthusiastic supporters, Biden specifically took issue with Trump’s comments regarding the ongoing housing crisis, questioning the former president's understanding of the market's failure and the implications of his business-oriented mindset.

Biden emphasized the importance of moral integrity among leaders, pointing out that previous presidents, including those from the Republican Party, maintained a moral center when it came to American values and rights. He challenged the audience to envision a scenario where Ronald Reagan would endorse the exploitation of individuals suffering through economic hardship, a stark contrast to what he perceives as Trump’s approach.

The Vice President articulated a belief that Trump lacks the fundamental sensibilities and values that are typically expected from American politicians. Biden's remarks were particularly pointed when he referenced Trump's response to Hillary Clinton’s accusation of him rooting for a housing market collapse. He argued that this perspective reflects a troubling business mentality that prioritizes profit over the well-being of the American people.

Biden also took issue with Trump’s assertion that not paying taxes is indicative of intelligence. He contrasted this viewpoint with the daily struggles faced by working-class individuals who diligently contribute to the tax system. This juxtaposition underscored Biden’s argument that Trump’s views are disconnected from the realities faced by ordinary Americans.

Expressing palpable anger over Trump’s perspectives, Biden articulated the broader implications these views have for the American public. He conveyed a sense of urgency, urging voters to consider the ramifications of electing a leader who exhibits such cynicism towards the populace. 

Concluding his remarks, Biden reinforced the notion that the choice in the upcoming election should be unequivocally clear. He criticized Trump’s approach as one that undermines the dignity and struggles of the American people, calling for a leadership that genuinely reflects the values and rights that have long been a cornerstone of the nation.

As the election draws nearer, Biden’s rally in Philadelphia serves as a reminder of the stark contrasts between his vision for America and that of his opponent. With a focus on empathy, integrity, and a commitment to the working class, Biden aims to rally support for a campaign that he believes will restore dignity and hope to the American political landscape.",-5.0,1.0,453.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.011037527593818985,460.0,0.0625,0.002173913043478261
Real_42-Webpage,National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6,"Story highlights Hillary Clinton has a 6-point lead over Donald Trump in a four way race, according to a new poll

Clinton has the edge over Trump on a number of key issues in the poll ahead of the first presidential debate

(CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.

The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.

Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.

Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.

Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament.

A recent McClatchy-Marist poll reveals that Hillary Clinton has established a 6-point lead over Donald Trump, with the former Secretary of State garnering 45% support compared to Trump's 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. The poll also indicates that Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is receiving 10% of the vote, while Green Party candidate Jill Stein polls at 4%.

This finding is echoed by a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, which shows a similar margin, with Clinton leading Trump 43% to 37%. The demographics of the poll highlight Clinton's significant advantage among black voters, where she commands an overwhelming 93% support compared to Trump's 3%. Additionally, Clinton holds a strong lead among Latino voters at 74%, although her support drops to 60% when third-party candidates are taken into account.

Despite her lead in the polls, both candidates are facing low favorability ratings, with Clinton at 40% and Trump slightly lower at 37%. Interestingly, Trump holds a slight edge in perceived honesty and trustworthiness, with 44% of respondents viewing him as more trustworthy compared to 36% for Clinton. 

When it comes to shared values and caring for the public, both candidates are viewed equally. However, Clinton outperforms Trump in assessments of who knows how to do the job and in terms of temperament. 

As the race progresses, these polling numbers will be critical indicators of voter sentiment as the candidates prepare for the upcoming election. The dynamics of support among different demographics and the influence of third-party candidates will likely play a significant role in shaping the final outcome.",23.0,21.0,310.0,2.090909090909091,0.07419354838709677,314.0,1.9090909090909092,0.06687898089171974
Real_43-Webpage,“Public School Forced My Child To,"7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

“Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.”

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

“During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.”

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

“Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.”

It referenced the jihad as,

“a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years.

A public high school in Maryland, La Plata High School, is under scrutiny following allegations that it has been indoctrinating students with Islamic teachings. The claims, which have surfaced through a lawsuit filed by John and Melissa Wood, have raised significant concerns among parents and community members regarding the school's curriculum and its treatment of religious beliefs.

The lawsuit, brought forth by the Woods through the Thomas More Law Center, specifically accuses the school of forcing students to recite the Islamic statement of faith, known as the Shahada, and requiring them to memorize the five pillars of Islam. John Wood has taken a strong stance on the issue, alleging that he faced retaliation for voicing his concerns about the Islamic teachings being presented in the classroom. He claims he was banned from the school after raising these issues, which has further fueled the controversy surrounding the case.

Richard Thompson, President of the Thomas More Law Center, has publicly supported the Woods' claims, stating that the school compelled Wood's daughter to disparage her Christian faith. This assertion has sparked intense debate about the balance of religious teachings within public education and the potential implications for students of different faiths.

The lawsuit posits that reciting the Shahada is tantamount to conversion for non-Muslims, including Christians and Jews. This assertion has raised alarms among those who believe that public schools should remain neutral in matters of religious belief. The Woods argue that La Plata High School has not only failed to provide adequate coverage of Christianity but has also made disparaging remarks about the Christian faith while promoting Islamic teachings. 

The lawsuit highlights that the school’s curriculum inadequately included important Christian texts, such as the Bible and the Ten Commandments. According to the allegations, classroom materials suggested that Muslims possess a stronger faith than Christians and portrayed Islam as a predominantly peaceful religion. One handout reportedly emphasized that the Quran does not advocate for martyrdom through suicide bombing and stressed that most Muslims do not endorse such actions.

The accusations date back to the 2014-2015 school year, raising questions about the content of the curriculum over the years and the potential impact on students’ understanding of their own beliefs. The case has garnered attention not only for its content but also for the broader implications it may have on religious education in public schools.

As of now, Charles County Public Schools has not issued any comments regarding the lawsuit, which names Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and the Board of Education as defendants. The lack of response from the school district has left many in the community wondering about the school's stance on the allegations.

Neither the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) nor the Freedom From Religion Foundation has commented on the case, leaving some observers to speculate on the potential legal ramifications and the future of religious education in public schools. As the situation develops, many are watching closely to see how the courts will address these serious allegations.",-5.0,-19.0,511.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.009784735812133072,565.0,-1.0,-0.033628318584070796

Real_47-Webpage,KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism,"“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can’t I?

Rock legend Gene Simmons, best known as the flamboyant bassist of the iconic band KISS, recently shared his provocative views on Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man accused of orchestrating the New York and New Jersey bombings. In a bold statement, Simmons suggested that Rahami ""should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend,"" reflecting his characteristic bluntness and willingness to tackle controversial subjects head-on.

Simmons, who is recognized for his outspoken opinions on personal liberty and the free market, did not shy away from addressing the broader issue of Islamic terrorism. He argued for the necessity of increased profiling, stating, “Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart.” His comments come amidst ongoing debates about national security and the effectiveness of current measures to combat terrorism.

The rock star emphasized that profiling should be deemed acceptable during wartime, a stance that has sparked discussions about the balance between security and civil liberties. When confronted with the potential for unfair profiling, Simmons acknowledged the concern, saying, “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist.” His remarks highlight a contentious viewpoint that challenges the status quo in the conversation about how best to ensure public safety.

In a humorous twist, the article speculated about the possibility of Simmons being appointed as the director of Homeland Security should Donald Trump secure the presidency. While this notion is likely more tongue-in-cheek than serious, it underscores Simmons' larger-than-life persona and his willingness to engage in the national dialogue on security and terrorism.

It is important to note that the views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. As the conversation around terrorism and profiling continues to evolve, Simmons’ comments add a provocative layer to the ongoing discourse, inviting both support and criticism from various corners of the public.",12.0,18.0,381.0,0.5714285714285714,0.031496062992125984,365.0,1.6363636363636365,0.049315068493150684
Real_48-Webpage,"Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'","(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""

""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""

Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.

Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.

Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.

""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""

""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""

""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""

Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016

In response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.

Danny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.",http://cnn.it/2cQyS4N,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,"Dan Merica,Eugene Scott",http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161118161709-cop-punches-woman-in-face-thumb-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718110446-02-officer-mohamed-noor-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717224427-justine-ruszczyk-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170711043320-georgia-police-beating-jnd-orig-vstop-00000612-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170104090632-north-carolina-school-body-slam-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170720014308-baltimore-pd-body-cam-video-release-02-large-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170626185531-jordan-edwards-roy-oliver-split-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712182221-florida-state-attorney-aramis-ayala-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170818111936-dashcam-video-ohio-violent-arrest-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160707080401-philando-castile-facebook-2-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520225617-georgia-man-tased-death-police-pkg-00012201-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717113139-australian-woman-minneapolis-police-shooting-nr-00000812-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718090944-betsy-hodges-7-18-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712054244-louisiana-couple-police-shooting-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160428084627-baltimore-teen-replica-gun-shot-dnt-00001823-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html,"{""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""author"": ""Eugene Scott and Dan Merica, CNN"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-col,col-controversial-police-incidents-"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Election 2016, US election, Tulsa, shooting, politics, Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable' - CNNPolitics"", ""article"": {""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202""}, ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-21T14:20:33Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, outlined a two-pronged approach to prevent police-involved shootings.

In the wake of escalating tensions surrounding police-involved shootings, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, has laid out a comprehensive two-pronged strategy aimed at mitigating such incidents and fostering better community-police relations. The announcement comes in light of a series of high-profile shootings, including the recent tragic death of unarmed black man Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Mook's first prong emphasizes the urgent need for establishing national standards for managing police situations. Currently, police conduct is largely governed by local policies, which vary widely across the country and lack a cohesive set of best practices. By instituting uniform national guidelines, the campaign aims to enhance police training protocols, thereby reducing the likelihood of violent confrontations. This approach seeks to create a more consistent framework for law enforcement agencies, ensuring that officers are better equipped to handle potentially volatile situations.

The necessity of this initiative has been underscored by recent incidents, including the shooting of Crutcher by Officer Betty Shelby. Crutcher's car had broken down, and he was shot after raising his hands in what appeared to be a gesture of surrender. This incident has reignited discussions around police conduct and the tragic outcomes that can occur when local policies fall short of protecting citizens' rights.

In addition to establishing national standards, Clinton's strategy also focuses on improving relationships between police and minority communities. Mook highlighted the importance of community policing and the investment of resources to build trust and collaboration. By fostering positive interactions between law enforcement and the communities they serve, the campaign believes it can help alleviate tensions and reduce the frequency of violent encounters.

Clinton has been vocal about the issue of systematic racism, particularly in the wake of the Crutcher shooting. Following the incident, she expressed her outrage, labeling it ""intolerable"" and emphasizing the need for ongoing efforts to address racial inequalities within the criminal justice system. Her condemnation of systematic racism is not just a reaction to isolated incidents; it reflects a broader commitment to confronting the entrenched biases that permeate law enforcement practices.

The urgency of Clinton's message is further amplified by recent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, following the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. These protests resulted in injuries to approximately 12 police officers, highlighting the deep-seated frustrations within communities affected by police violence. Clinton's campaign recognizes that the cycle of violence and unrest must be addressed head-on to prevent further escalation.

In her outreach, Clinton plans to tackle the issue of implicit bias directly, particularly addressing white audiences about the unequal treatment faced by people of color in the criminal justice system. This candid approach aims to foster understanding and encourage dialogue around the systemic issues that contribute to racial disparities in policing.

While acknowledging the presence of dedicated and good police officers, Clinton has stressed that there is a critical need for reform in how systemic racism is handled within law enforcement. She has called for a collective acknowledgment that repeated incidents of police violence against unarmed black individuals must no longer be tolerated. Her campaign is advocating for a cultural shift within police departments to ensure that officers are held accountable and that communities feel safe and respected.

The Department of Justice, along with state authorities, is currently conducting investigations into the circumstances surrounding the Crutcher shooting, focusing on potential civil rights violations. These inquiries underscore the need for transparency and accountability in policing, further aligning with Clinton's commitment to reform.

As the nation grapples with the implications of police violence and systematic racism, Clinton's campaign is positioning itself at the forefront of this critical conversation. With a clear strategy aimed at transforming law enforcement practices and fostering community trust, the campaign seeks to address the urgent issues that have sparked nationwide protests and calls for change. The path forward, as outlined by Mook, emphasizes both accountability and collaboration, aiming to create a safer and more equitable society for all citizens.",-5.0,-29.0,656.0,-0.14705882352941177,-0.007621951219512195,741.0,-1.0357142857142858,-0.03913630229419703

Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager.

Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative.

Story Continued Below

“He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?”

Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.

Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.”

“So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked.

“You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.

In a critical tone, Conway took aim at Clinton’s transparency regarding her own strategy, noting that the former Secretary of State has publicly posted her plan to defeat ISIS on her campaign website. This move, according to Conway, raises concerns about the implications of revealing such information to the enemy.

Trump has previously declared his intent to ""knock the hell out of ISIS,"" yet he has refrained from divulging specifics of his strategy. This cautious approach is designed to prevent any potential advantage to the terrorist group by keeping operational details under wraps.

Conway reiterated that while Trump will provide insight into his strategy during the debate, he will not disclose exact tactics that could be exploited by ISIS. This careful balance aims to inform voters about Trump's stance on national security while safeguarding sensitive information.

As the debate approaches, all eyes will be on Trump to see how he articulates his plans for defeating ISIS and whether he can effectively differentiate his approach from that of Clinton. The discussion promises to be a pivotal moment in the campaign, particularly regarding national security issues.",-11.0,-8.0,331.0,-1.1,-0.03323262839879154,334.0,-0.6666666666666666,-0.023952095808383235

Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists.

During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear.

""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.""

""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens.

In a poignant address during his final United Nations General Assembly meeting in Manhattan, President Barack Obama reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to combating ISIS and other terrorist threats. His remarks come in the wake of recent attempts at mass violence that have heightened fears among Americans.

Addressing the nation, Obama acknowledged the anxiety that has gripped citizens following these violent incidents. He emphasized that succumbing to fear only serves to benefit terrorists, urging Americans to resist the urge to let fear dictate their lives. ""We must not allow terrorists to disrupt our daily routines or undermine the values we hold dear as a nation,"" he stated.

The president commended the swift actions of law enforcement in response to bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, which have drawn significant attention and concern. ""The quick response of our law enforcement agencies exemplifies the resilience and determination of our communities,"" Obama said, praising the bravery exhibited in the face of adversity.

He specifically highlighted the fortitude of New Yorkers and New Jersey residents, encouraging citizens to draw strength from their shared experiences and collective resolve. ""We are a tough people, and we will not be intimidated,"" he asserted, expressing pride in the resilience of the American spirit.

As investigations continue in Chelsea following a bomb explosion that injured dozens, Obama’s remarks serve as a reminder of the importance of unity and resilience in the face of terror. His call to action resonates as a powerful message that, despite the challenges posed by terrorism, the American people will stand firm and uphold their values in the fight against fear.",-6.0,-3.0,331.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.01812688821752266,318.0,-0.25,-0.009433962264150943
Real_50-Webpage,Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity,"United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.

The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.

At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.

""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.

Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""

JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45

""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.

""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""

The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.

A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.

Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.

""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""

Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.

""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.

""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.

The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.

""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement.

But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.

""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.""

The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.

The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.

""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""

Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.

""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.""

But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.

""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""

As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.

The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.

Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.

And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp.

""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said.",http://cnn.it/2deTou2,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg,Laura Koran,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920104405-02-obama-un-0920-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920152131-obama-united-nations-general-assembly-origwx-bw-00000210-exlarge-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920093742-obama-leaders-collage-edited-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html,"{""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""author"": ""Laura Koran"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,art-vid"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""politics, Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity - CNNPolitics"", ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-20T22:23:38Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- President Obama urged countries to address the global refugee crisis during a speech at the United Nations.

In a powerful address at the United Nations, President Barack Obama urged the international community to confront the escalating global refugee crisis, emphasizing the moral imperative to assist the millions of individuals displaced by violence. With a particular focus on the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, Obama underscored the urgent need for countries to respond compassionately to the plight of those forced to flee their homes.

During his speech, Obama convened a Leaders' Summit on Refugees, an initiative aimed at rallying support and resources to address the dire circumstances faced by refugees around the world. He described the current situation as a critical test of humanity, strongly criticizing the notion of erecting walls to keep refugees out. Instead, he called for solidarity and shared responsibility among nations to provide refuge and support to those in need.

The plight of Syrian refugees was a focal point of Obama's remarks, as he highlighted the staggering figure of 4.8 million individuals displaced by the ongoing conflict in Syria. He characterized this situation as particularly ""unacceptable,"" calling on world leaders to take decisive action to alleviate the suffering of those affected by war and persecution.

In a historical context, Obama drew parallels between the current refugee crisis and past failures to protect vulnerable populations, notably referencing the tragic fate of Jews fleeing Nazi Germany who were turned away by nations unwilling to offer sanctuary. This historical reflection served to underscore the urgency of the present moment, urging leaders not to repeat the mistakes of the past.

According to reports from the United Nations, the scale of the refugee crisis is staggering, with 65.3 million people displaced globally as of 2015. Among these, 21.3 million individuals are classified as refugees, highlighting the enormity of the challenge facing the international community. The summit convened by Obama aimed to address these issues by increasing funding, enhancing resettlement opportunities, and expanding access to education and work for refugees.

Despite the lofty goals set forth at the summit, many aid organizations expressed skepticism regarding the potential for meaningful commitments to arise from the discussions. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of translating the pledges made into tangible support for those affected by the crisis. This skepticism reflects a broader apprehension about the political will required to confront the challenges posed by the refugee situation.

In a significant move, the United States announced plans to increase its refugee intake from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 in 2017. However, this initiative faces considerable obstacles, as the Obama administration contends with congressional resistance to increased funding and support for refugee programs. The political landscape surrounding immigration and refugee policy remains contentious, posing challenges to the implementation of the proposed increases.

The summit also featured co-hosts who highlighted the considerable humanitarian contributions made by world leaders in response to the refugee crisis. These contributions, while commendable, underscore the need for a collective approach to address the root causes of displacement and provide sustainable solutions for refugees.

The urgency of the situation was further illustrated by a poignant installation in London, where a ""life jacket graveyard"" was created to symbolize the dangers faced by migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea. This powerful visual representation serves as a stark reminder of the risks many refugees undertake in search of safety and a better life.

The refugee crisis is not confined to specific regions; it is a global issue impacting nations across the world. A significant number of refugees are currently residing in developing countries, particularly within the ""global south."" This demographic reality emphasizes the need for a coordinated international response to provide assistance and resources to those countries bearing the brunt of the crisis.

In a recent development, South Sudan has joined the ranks of nations with over one million refugees abroad, further contributing to the growing global displacement crisis. The emergence of South Sudan as a significant source of refugees highlights the complex interplay of conflict, instability, and humanitarian needs that define the current landscape.

As the world grapples with this unprecedented crisis, President Obama's call to action resonates with urgency. His appeal for unity and compassion serves as a reminder that the refugee crisis is not just a political issue; it is a humanitarian challenge that requires collective action and commitment from all nations. The responsibility to protect and support those fleeing violence and persecution rests not only with individual countries but with the global community as a whole.

In conclusion, the Leaders' Summit on Refugees represents a critical moment in addressing the global refugee crisis. While the challenges are immense, the opportunity for meaningful change exists if nations can come together to fulfill their moral obligation to those in need. As President Obama aptly stated, this crisis is a test of humanity, and it is incumbent upon all of us to rise to the occasion. The world must act decisively to ensure that the millions of displaced individuals receive the support and protection they deserve, paving the way for a more compassionate and just global community.",-13.0,-24.0,1293.0,-0.325,-0.010054137664346482,935.0,-0.7058823529411765,-0.025668449197860963
Real_51-Webpage,Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings,"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues

It's a recurring theme of his campaign

Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions.

The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law.

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.

""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

Trump's remarks highlighted a stark contrast between his views and those of Clinton, whom he accused of being more critical of his supporters than of Islamist terrorism itself. He referenced Clinton's previous characterization of his supporters as being in a ""basket of deplorables,"" suggesting that her focus lies more in criticizing Americans than in confronting the threats posed by radical Islam.

Real_52-Webpage,In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism,"Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.

The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.

But the ""he said/she said"" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics.

Story Continued Below

While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?

In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.

Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.

But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.

As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both ""he said and she said""—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.

One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?

I don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.

The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.

Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.

Obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.

The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.”

Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.

The last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”

If you’re not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.

In recent years, the landscape of journalism has been under scrutiny, particularly regarding the methods employed in reporting contentious issues. One approach that has garnered significant criticism is the ""he said/she said"" journalism model. This method, which often presents competing claims without substantial analysis or context, has been a focal point of debate among media scholars and practitioners alike. NYU professor Jay Rosen has been one of the most vocal critics of this approach since 2009, arguing that it creates a false equivalence between truth and falsehood.

The debate surrounding the efficacy of the ""he said/she said"" model intensified following a notable piece published by the New York Times, written by journalist Michael Barbaro. In this article, Barbaro took a firm stance against the statements made by former President Donald Trump, harshly criticizing the inaccuracies and misleading nature of his claims. This marked a departure from the traditional reliance on the ""he said/she said"" format, which often allows for the unfiltered presentation of opposing views without adequate context or fact-checking.

Critics of the ""he said/she said"" model celebrated this shift in journalistic practice, viewing it as a significant evolution in how journalists engage with political discourse. The traditional format, which often prioritizes neutrality and balance, has been seen as inadequate in the face of blatant falsehoods. Rosen's critique emphasizes that presenting both sides of an argument without discerning the truth can mislead audiences and contribute to a distorted understanding of reality. He advocates for a journalistic approach that prioritizes truth over false balance, urging reporters to provide context and fact-checking to inform the public accurately.

One of the more troubling aspects of the ""he said/she said"" convention is its exploitation by figures like Trump, who have mastered the art of using this method to distort political discourse. By framing false statements as mere opinions, this approach has led to a proliferation of misinformation, blurring the lines between fact and fiction. The reliance on this format can inadvertently lend credibility to misleading narratives, allowing them to thrive unchecked.

However, proponents of the ""he said/she said"" journalism model argue that strict adherence to this format is essential for maintaining journalistic integrity. They contend that providing a platform for all voices, even those that may be controversial or misleading, is crucial for fostering an informed public. By presenting differing viewpoints, journalists can offer readers the necessary context to form their own opinions, particularly in a media landscape where individuals may only be exposed to one side of a story.

The presence of dissenting voices in journalism is vital for open inquiry and preventing the dominance of misleading narratives. Historical examples from the realm of science illustrate how minority critiques can challenge prevailing paradigms and ultimately lead to progress. Just as scientific discourse thrives on the examination of competing theories, so too can journalism benefit from presenting a range of perspectives. This diversity of thought can encourage readers to engage critically with the information presented to them.

Moreover, the tone of journalism plays a significant role in shaping public perception. When journalists present facts without editorializing or inserting their opinions, they create an environment that encourages readers to engage with differing viewpoints. This approach can foster a more informed and nuanced public discourse, as audiences are prompted to consider multiple angles before arriving at a conclusion.

In conclusion, the ""he said/she said"" journalism model presents a complex dilemma for modern reporting. While it can serve to keep journalists accountable and provide a platform for diverse voices, it also risks perpetuating falsehoods and misleading narratives. As the media landscape continues to evolve, the challenge for journalists will be to strike a balance between maintaining integrity and ensuring that truth prevails in the face of misinformation. Ultimately, the goal should be to foster an informed public capable of engaging in meaningful debate, while also holding those in power accountable for their statements. The ongoing discussion around this approach underscores the need for a thoughtful examination of journalistic practices in an era marked by polarization and misinformation.",6.0,-29.0,2265.0,0.06593406593406594,0.0026490066225165563,764.0,-1.0,-0.03795811518324607
Real_53-Webpage,Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. […] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”

Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. is facing significant scrutiny following the tragic death of 38-year-old Terrill Thomas in the Milwaukee County Jail. Thomas was found dead on April 24, nine days after his arrest related to a shooting. Reports indicate that he died from profound dehydration, with the Milwaukee County medical examiner ruling the death a homicide caused by another person's actions.

Inmates in the facility have come forward, alleging that Thomas begged for water in the days leading up to his death. They claim that his water supply was cut off for six days, and one inmate even warned jailers about the potential danger this posed to Thomas. Attorney Erik J. Heipt, who represents Thomas' family, revealed that he has received calls from other inmates reporting similar water shortages in their cells. He highlighted a concerning pattern, recalling a similar incident in 2011 when another inmate died from lack of water.

Clarke, who has become a polarizing figure, has frequently appeared on Fox News to criticize the Black Lives Matter movement, likening it to international terrorists. His vocal support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has further solidified his controversial status. Clarke notably spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention and is currently involved in a pro-Trump bus tour organized by a supporting super PAC.

The financial aspects of Clarke's tenure have also come under scrutiny. In 2015 alone, he reportedly received over $150,000 from speaking fees, travel reimbursements, and gifts, raising questions about the appropriateness of such compensation while overseeing a facility where an inmate's basic needs were allegedly neglected.

As the investigation into Thomas' death continues, the community is left grappling with the implications of this tragedy and the accountability of those in charge of the Milwaukee County Jail. Clarke's dual role as a law enforcement leader and a political figure continues to draw attention, with many calling for a deeper examination of the conditions within the jail and the treatment of inmates.",-25.0,-36.0,375.0,-1.9230769230769231,-0.06666666666666667,381.0,-2.5714285714285716,-0.09448818897637795

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?”

In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

“I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

As the political landscape heats up in the lead-up to the presidential election, a contentious debate is emerging surrounding the role of moderators in presidential debates, particularly regarding the practice of fact-checking. Janet Brown, the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), has stirred the pot by arguing against the inclusion of fact-checking during these crucial events. Her stance raises significant questions about the responsibility of moderators and the implications for candidates, especially in light of recent analysis regarding the frequency of misrepresentations by one of the leading candidates, Donald Trump.

Brown's comments come at a time when the Trump campaign has been vocal in its opposition to the idea of moderators fact-checking statements made during debates. The campaign expresses concern that such interventions could hinder Trump's performance, potentially affecting his chances of success in a highly competitive political environment. This perspective aligns with the broader strategy of the Trump campaign, which has often sought to present a narrative that emphasizes unchallenged statements and positions.

Recent analysis has underscored the gravity of the situation, revealing that Trump has been found to lie approximately every 3 minutes and 15 seconds during public appearances. This staggering frequency of misrepresentation spans a wide range of topics, from policy issues to personal anecdotes. While it is important to note that Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent, has also been known to misrepresent facts, the scale and frequency of Trump's inaccuracies are significantly higher. This discrepancy has led to growing concerns about the implications of allowing unchecked statements in debates.

Critics of Brown's position and the Trump campaign's stance have voiced their frustrations, particularly among journalists and media analysts. Many argue that the role of moderators should extend beyond simply facilitating discussion; they should also serve as guardians of factual integrity during debates. The idea that moderators would refrain from fact-checking raises questions about the effectiveness of debates as a platform for informed voter decision-making. Critics contend that if moderators do not challenge falsehoods, it undermines the very purpose of these debates, which is to provide voters with accurate information about the candidates' positions and qualifications.

On the other hand, Trump supporters have expressed enthusiasm at the prospect of unchallenged statements during debates. They believe that this approach could bolster their candidate's chances of victory by allowing him to present his views without the interruption of fact-checking. This sentiment reflects a broader trend among some segments of the electorate who value a more direct and unfiltered form of communication from their candidates, viewing it as a departure from traditional political discourse.

As the debate over fact-checking continues, it is clear that the stakes are high. The upcoming debates will not only serve as a platform for candidates to present their visions for the future but will also test the boundaries of how truth is navigated in political discourse. The decisions made by the CPD and the moderators will have lasting implications for the electoral process and the way voters engage with the information presented to them.

In this charged atmosphere, the tension between the need for factual accountability and the desire for unfiltered dialogue will undoubtedly shape the dynamics of the debates. As candidates prepare to face off, the question remains: will the moderators uphold their responsibility to challenge falsehoods, or will they adhere to a more laissez-faire approach that could allow misleading statements to go unchecked? The answer may very well influence the outcome of the election and the future of political communication in America.

Ultimately, the debate over fact-checking highlights broader issues within the political landscape, including the role of media, the nature of truth in politics, and the expectations of voters. As the nation gears up for the debates, it is essential for all stakeholders—candidates, moderators, and voters alike—to consider the implications of the choices made in this high-stakes arena. The outcome could redefine the relationship between candidates and the electorate, as well as the standards by which political discourse is measured in the years to come. 

In conclusion, the ongoing discussion about fact-checking in presidential debates encapsulates a critical moment in American politics. The choices made by those in charge of moderating these debates will not only impact the immediate electoral landscape but may also set precedents for how future political discussions are conducted. As the nation watches, the importance of truth and accountability in political dialogue remains at the forefront of this pivotal moment in democracy.",11.0,4.0,839.0,0.3235294117647059,0.013110846245530394,822.0,0.13793103448275862,0.004866180048661801

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.

“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.

“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

In a recent analysis of the highly anticipated debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, a prominent advisor to Trump, commended the former president for his restraint and self-control. This sentiment emerged as both candidates faced off in a heated exchange that covered a range of contentious issues, including women's rights and personal attacks.

Conway specifically highlighted Trump's decision not to retaliate against Clinton's accusations regarding derogatory remarks about women, even when the opportunity arose. Clinton, during the debate, took aim at Trump, referencing a campaign ad that illustrated his history of using derogatory names for women. However, Conway noted that Trump's choice to avoid attacking Clinton's family in response to these allegations demonstrated a level of restraint that she believes is essential for presidential conduct.

""Restraint is a presidential virtue,"" Conway stated, lauding Trump for his self-control in a moment that could have easily escalated into a personal attack. This decision not only reflected Trump's character but also showcased a strategic approach to the debate, allowing him to maintain a level of decorum in a high-stakes environment.

Following the debate, Trump himself acknowledged his decision to hold back from making a harsh comment about Clinton, particularly due to the presence of her family in the audience. This choice to prioritize decorum over aggression was viewed by Conway as a significant aspect of Trump's performance, suggesting that he could have chosen a more confrontational route but opted instead for a more dignified approach.

While Conway praised Trump, she was less complimentary of Clinton's performance during the debate. She argued that Clinton failed to deliver a strong argument or a decisive ""knockout punch"" against Trump. According to Conway, Clinton's responses appeared rehearsed, lacking the authenticity and directness that voters often seek in a candidate. This critique extended to Clinton's inability to effectively answer questions posed by the moderator, which Conway interpreted as a sign of weakness in her debate strategy.

Conway also raised concerns about the content of Clinton's arguments, questioning what significant takeaways or visions she provided for addressing pressing issues such as economic growth and wage stagnation. In her view, Clinton's failure to articulate a clear plan left voters wanting more and did not effectively counter Trump's points during the debate.

The debate, which was watched by millions, was marked by moments of tension and confrontation. However, Conway's focus on Trump's restraint served to frame the discussion around the qualities of leadership and the importance of maintaining composure in challenging situations. By choosing not to engage in personal attacks, Trump positioned himself as a candidate who prioritizes presidential decorum, a narrative that Conway is eager to promote.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of this debate will likely resonate with voters as they consider their options in the upcoming election. Conway's analysis emphasizes the contrasting styles of the two candidates, with Trump embodying a more restrained approach while Clinton's performance was characterized by a lack of direct engagement.

In conclusion, Kellyanne Conway's reflections on the debate underscore the complexities of political discourse and the varying strategies employed by candidates. As voters prepare to make their decisions, the qualities of restraint, self-control, and the ability to articulate a clear vision for the future will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping public perception and electoral outcomes.",5.0,11.0,650.0,0.35714285714285715,0.007692307692307693,644.0,0.5,0.017080745341614908

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

[A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,,https://www.washingtonpost.com,{'$date': 1474243200000},,"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg&w=60,https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,"{""theme"": ""normal"", ""news_keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Washington Post"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste."", ""title"": ""France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery"", ""url"": ""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""image"": ""https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""unsafe-url"", ""twitter"": {""site"": ""@WashingtonPost"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""creator"": ""jameskmcauley""}, ""object-hash"": 1503984085, ""robots"": ""index,follow"", ""apple-itunes-app"": ""app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 500835072, ""app_id"": 41245586762}, ""keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste.""}","- France has become the first country to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils, effective in 2020.

In a groundbreaking move towards environmental sustainability, France has officially become the first country to implement a ban on plastic plates, cups, and utensils, a policy that took effect in 2020. This ambitious initiative is part of the broader Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, which aims to reshape waste management and promote eco-friendly practices across the nation.

The legislation, which also includes a prohibition on plastic bags in grocery stores that began in July, reflects France's commitment to fostering a circular economy. This approach emphasizes the importance of product design and recycling, promoting a system where materials are reused and waste is minimized. The government aims to shift away from the traditional linear economy, where products are created, used, and discarded, towards a more sustainable model that conserves resources and reduces environmental impact.

Plastic pollution has become a pressing global issue, with plastics failing to biodegrade and instead breaking down into harmful microplastics. These tiny particles pose significant dangers to wildlife and ecosystems, while also contributing to climate change. By banning single-use plastics, France is taking a proactive stance against these environmental threats.

French President François Hollande has voiced strong support for the ban, highlighting its alignment with the country's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy sources. The initiative is seen as a crucial step in addressing climate change and protecting the planet for future generations.

However, the ban has not been without controversy. Some critics argue that it infringes upon European Union laws regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers. This has led to significant pushback from industry groups, including Pack2Go Europe, which has announced plans to challenge the ban legally. The organization is urging the European Commission to take action against France, claiming that the legislation could disrupt trade and create an uneven playing field for manufacturers.

Initial proposals for the ban were set to be implemented in 2017, but the timeline was postponed amid concerns regarding its potential impact on low-income families. Critics had raised alarms that the ban could disproportionately affect those who rely on affordable disposable products, leading to increased costs for everyday items. The government has since worked to address these concerns, allowing exceptions for compostable and biosourced materials, which can provide more sustainable alternatives without burdening low-income households.

As France forges ahead with its plastic ban, it sets a precedent for other nations grappling with the challenges of plastic waste. The success of this initiative could inspire similar measures across Europe and beyond, as countries seek to combat the growing threat of plastic pollution. With the world watching, France’s commitment to reducing plastic waste and promoting a circular economy may well serve as a model for environmental policy in the years to come. 

In conclusion, France's pioneering ban on plastic utensils marks a significant milestone in the global fight against plastic pollution. While challenges remain, the country’s bold actions reflect a growing recognition of the urgent need for sustainable practices in waste disposal and resource management.",-14.0,-4.0,529.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.026465028355387523,574.0,-0.18181818181818182,-0.006968641114982578
Real_57-Webpage,Paul Ryan ducks on stop-and-frisk,"Story highlights Ryan called for calm in Charlotte, but would not comment on Trump's ""stop and frisk"" proposals

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump.

""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,"" Ryan said.

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.

But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.

What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.

The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said.

As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first?

Charlotte, North Carolina - The recent shooting of a black man by Charlotte police has ignited a wave of speculation, anger, and unrest across the city. The incident has led to widespread riots, resulting in looting and theft, and has even caused the shutdown of major highways, including I-85. 

The man at the center of the controversy, 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, has been depicted by some as an innocent individual, merely on his way to volunteer. This narrative has gained traction on social media, fueling further outrage among community members and activists who demand justice and accountability from law enforcement.

However, the situation is more complex than this portrayal suggests. Questions have emerged regarding the police officers' perspective and whether their account of the events leading to the shooting matters amidst the growing unrest. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney addressed these concerns in a news conference, providing a detailed account of the incident.

According to Chief Putney, officers were actively searching for a suspect when they observed Scott exiting a vehicle while armed with a handgun. The police instructed Scott to drop the weapon; however, he exited the vehicle a second time still holding the gun. Chief Putney emphasized that Scott posed a significant threat to the officers, which he argued justified the use of deadly force in this high-stress situation.

In his remarks, Chief Putney called for a change in the narrative surrounding the incident. He highlighted discrepancies between the portrayal of Scott on social media and the facts as presented by law enforcement. The police chief's comments aimed to clarify the circumstances leading up to the shooting and to address what he described as a ""mischaracterization"" of the events.

The unrest in Charlotte has drawn attention to broader issues regarding law enforcement and community relations, particularly in the context of police shootings involving black men. Critics of the police response argue that the use of deadly force is often excessive and that systemic issues within law enforcement need to be addressed. The situation has sparked a heated debate about race, justice, and the role of police in society.

As tensions continue to rise, the community grapples with the aftermath of the shooting and the subsequent riots. Activists are calling for transparency and accountability, while others urge for a more nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by police officers in dangerous situations. The dichotomy of perspectives reflects the deeper divisions within society regarding issues of race, justice, and the use of force.

The Charlotte police shooting has become a flashpoint for discussions about law enforcement practices and community safety. As the city faces the consequences of the unrest, the need for dialogue and understanding between law enforcement and the community is more critical than ever. The events surrounding Keith Lamont Scott's death will likely have lasting implications for both the city of Charlotte and the ongoing national conversation about race and policing in America. 

As the investigation continues and more information comes to light, the community remains on edge, grappling with the complexities of the situation and the urgent call for justice. The narrative surrounding the incident is still evolving, and it remains to be seen how it will shape the future of policing and community relations in Charlotte and beyond.",-23.0,-13.0,562.0,-0.9583333333333334,-0.04092526690391459,613.0,-0.5416666666666666,-0.021207177814029365

ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June.

The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

""The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,"" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. ""As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.""

Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.

Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.

Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.

Real_6-Webpage,Obama weighs in on the debate,"Obama weighs in on the debate

President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change.

The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.”

And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.”

The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both.

""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012

""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,"" Obama said, ""that worries me.""

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is ""naturally occurring.""

In the wake of a heated debate, former President Barack Obama has reiterated his critical stance on Donald Trump, emphasizing concerns over the Republican candidate's preparedness and temperament for the presidency. During a recent interview with Ryan Seacrest, Obama articulated his belief that Trump lacks the essential qualities needed to navigate the complexities of the highest office in the land.

Obama expressed particular alarm regarding Trump's ability to handle pressing global threats, including nuclear weapons and climate change. He underscored the importance of having a leader who can confront such serious challenges, especially in an era where nuclear proliferation remains a significant concern. The former president pointed out that Trump's comments regarding the potential for Japan and South Korea to pursue their own nuclear arsenals are particularly troubling, reflecting a lack of understanding of international security dynamics.

In stark contrast to Trump, Obama praised Hillary Clinton's debate performance, commending her qualifications and readiness to lead. He emphasized the importance of core values such as inclusion and opportunity in a presidential candidate, which he argues Trump fails to embody. This lack of foundational principles, according to Obama, raises substantial doubts about Trump's suitability for the presidency.

Obama also took the opportunity to highlight Trump's previous statements regarding climate change, including a notable tweet from 2012 in which Trump dismissed the phenomenon as a hoax created by China. This rhetoric, combined with Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway's assertion that Trump believes climate change is ""naturally occurring,"" has further fueled Obama's concerns. The former president pointed to the overwhelming consensus among scientists regarding the urgent need to address climate change, stressing that the issue is not merely a political talking point but a critical challenge that requires immediate attention.

As the election approaches, Obama's remarks serve as a reminder of the stark differences in approach and ideology between the candidates. His emphasis on the importance of preparedness, core values, and an understanding of global threats resonates with voters who prioritize stability and informed leadership in turbulent times. With the stakes higher than ever, Obama’s critique of Trump underscores the broader implications for future generations, particularly in relation to nuclear safety and environmental stewardship.",-7.0,2.0,419.0,-0.5833333333333334,-0.016706443914081145,421.0,0.14285714285714285,0.004750593824228029
Real_60-Webpage,How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying “yes” to Fox News almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning, he is booked on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn’t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

In a notable shift from his previous approach to media engagement, former President Donald Trump has recently adopted a strategy that sees him primarily interacting with Fox News. Known for his openness and accessibility to various media outlets during his political career, Trump’s current focus on Fox News shows, such as “Fox & Friends” and “The O’Reilly Factor,” marks a significant change in his communication tactics.

This new strategy appears to be aimed at energizing his base of supporters, as Trump frequently appears on Fox News to share his views and rally his followers. However, this approach comes with its drawbacks. By limiting his media interactions to a single network, Trump is not only avoiding challenging questions but also frustrating journalists who seek to hold him accountable on a range of controversial topics. Issues such as the birther conspiracy and his responses to terrorism, which have drawn scrutiny in the past, are largely sidestepped in these exclusive interviews.

Critics argue that this strategy could hinder Trump’s ability to reach undecided voters who lie outside his base. Unlike other successful politicians, such as George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who engaged with a broader audience and campaigned in swing districts, Trump seems to be concentrating his efforts on rallies designed primarily for his core supporters. This focus raises concerns about his potential to broaden his appeal as he gears up for future electoral challenges.

Adding historical context to Trump's current media strategy, it is worth noting that many Fox News viewers were taken by surprise by the results of the 2012 election. This unexpected outcome serves as a cautionary tale for Trump, suggesting that an insular approach to media engagement may not yield the desired electoral success. By primarily speaking to a single network, Trump risks alienating a wider audience that he may need to secure victory in future elections.

As Trump continues to navigate the complex landscape of American politics, his choice to engage predominantly with Fox News could have significant implications for his campaign strategy. While it may galvanize his loyal supporters, it remains to be seen whether this approach will effectively resonate with the broader electorate, especially in an increasingly polarized political environment. The coming months will reveal whether this exclusive strategy will pay off or if it will ultimately limit his political ambitions.",-1.0,20.0,421.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.0023752969121140144,446.0,1.3333333333333333,0.04484304932735426
Real_61-Webpage,“Why Aren’t I 50 Points Ahead?” – Eagle Rising,"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again.

Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.

But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.”

For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.

Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump?

At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question:

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

As the 2016 presidential campaign progresses, many liberals initially believed that Hillary Clinton's victory was a foregone conclusion. The sentiment among supporters was that the campaign was little more than a formality, with the former Secretary of State poised to secure the presidency. However, as the race unfolded, it became evident that Clinton's strategy may have inadvertently contributed to her challenges.

Clinton’s campaign adopted a strategy that involved minimal media contact, which allowed her opponent, Donald Trump, to dominate the conversation. This decision has come under scrutiny as Trump began to gain traction, particularly following the Democratic National Convention (DNC). With the reality of a competitive race setting in, discussions among Democrats shifted to the necessity of a ""Plan B,"" as concerns grew about Clinton's ability to maintain her lead.

Recent polling data has revealed a troubling trend for Clinton, with Trump leading in several key battleground states. This shift in momentum has raised alarms within her campaign and among her supporters. During a campaign event in Las Vegas, Clinton openly questioned why she wasn't ""50 points ahead"" of Trump, reflecting her surprise and frustration at the changing dynamics of the race.

Despite the challenges, Clinton has emphasized the importance of her policies and their potential impact on voters. She has called upon her supporters to actively engage in spreading her message and countering Trump's narrative. Recognizing the need for a concerted effort, Clinton urged her backers to ""stage an intervention"" for anyone considering voting for Trump. She encouraged them to present factual comparisons of her record against his, aiming to clarify her vision for the country and the implications of a Trump presidency.

As the campaign enters a critical phase, Clinton's ability to rally her base and effectively communicate her message could be pivotal in shaping the election's outcome. With the stakes higher than ever, the coming weeks will be crucial for both candidates as they vie for the support of undecided voters in an increasingly polarized political landscape. The path to the presidency remains fraught with challenges for Clinton, who must now navigate a landscape that is far more competitive than anticipated just a few months ago.",11.0,22.0,413.0,0.6875,0.026634382566585957,424.0,1.375,0.05188679245283019

Over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, Bobby Knight said Wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like Donald Trump.

""There’s nobody that I’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right,"" Knight told an audience in Toledo, Ohio, his home state. ""And I think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United States. And there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been Donald Trump.""

Story Continued Below

Back on the campaign trail with Trump after several months, Knight extolled the Republican nominee as ""not just an American; he’s a world figure.""

""He’s known all over the world. Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together,"" the coach continued. ""United States around the world. A lot of businesses. Created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world.""

And Trump, Knight later indicated, is the person for the White House.

""Believe me when I tell you, I think you’re all gonna agree on this: Our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the United States of America,"" Knight said. He noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, ""immigration problems and on and on.""

Remarking on his study of history, Knight said that he had come to the conclusion that ""when I need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man I want to choose and the first man I want to see.""

Knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't ""dress as well as politicians dress, but I want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, I wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""

""And I think that when you leave, I hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the United States,"" Knight said.

He underscored the importance of having a leader who can navigate the complexities of national and global issues, asserting that Trump’s track record demonstrates an aptitude for addressing and fixing problems effectively. “In today’s world, we need someone who can tackle the challenges head-on, and I believe Trump has proven he can do just that,” Knight remarked.

Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it.

Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation.

That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.

ELIZABETH, NJ – Authorities are investigating a disturbing discovery made at a New Jersey train station, where three pipe bombs and two smaller explosive devices were found. The devices were located in a bag containing wires and pipes, which was discarded in a trash can near the NJ Transit station.

The FBI has promptly arrived on the scene to conduct a thorough investigation. The location of the bombs, found in a confined area, raises concerns that they may have been planted by a small team or possibly an individual. Investigators are currently assessing the situation and gathering evidence to determine the responsible party.

While the motive behind the bombings remains unclear, officials are considering various possibilities. Islamic terrorism is viewed as a likely explanation for the incident. However, the history of ""mad bombers""—individuals who engage in bomb-making for personal reasons rather than ideological ones—has also been cited as a potential avenue of investigation.

As the investigation unfolds, authorities are working diligently to ascertain the intent behind the bombings. Whether the motive was to instill fear among the public or to inflict mass casualties remains a critical question for law enforcement. The FBI's ongoing efforts may yield additional insights into the case as more information becomes available.

The situation is compounded by recent events, as the FBI has arrested five individuals believed to be linked to the Chelsea bombing investigation. However, it is important to note that none of these individuals have been charged at this time, and their connection to the current incident in Elizabeth is still under scrutiny.

Residents and commuters are urged to remain vigilant as authorities continue their investigation. The discovery of these devices has raised alarm within the community, prompting an increased police presence at the train station and surrounding areas.

As this story develops, updates will be provided to keep the public informed about the investigation and any potential threats to safety.

President Barack Obama also sat down with Zach Galifianakis to tout the Affordable Care Act

(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it.

Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video , plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself.

""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs.

Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump.

""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention.

Magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect

A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said.

""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening.

Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami.

""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer.""

The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.

Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

The defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, James Patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.

In a recent ruling, U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein has declined a request for the immediate arraignment of bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami on federal charges. The decision comes as Rahami remains in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, a situation confirmed by the magistrate during the proceedings.

Judge Gorenstein stated that Rahami does not need to appear in federal court until he is officially in federal custody. This assertion follows the federal government’s position that it has not yet arrested Rahami, with Gorenstein noting the absence of evidence to contradict this claim. The magistrate further disputed the defense lawyers' assertion that federal authorities were involved in Rahami's current detention, emphasizing the separation between state and federal jurisdictions in this case.

The ruling also addressed the defense's argument regarding a federal court rule that mandates prompt arraignment irrespective of state arrest. Gorenstein rejected this claim, reinforcing the notion that the legal processes must align with the current custody situation. As Rahami is currently hospitalized in Newark, the magistrate declined to schedule a court appearance and stated that he is unable to appoint defense representation at this time.

In a related development, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that Rahami would soon be transported to New York City to face federal charges. The federal complaint anticipated against him in New York is expected to take precedence over any state charges he may face in New Jersey. This move highlights the federal government's intention to prioritize the prosecution of Rahami at the federal level.

The decision from Gorenstein has garnered attention, yet U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office has not commented on the magistrate's ruling. Similarly, defense attorney James Patton has not responded to requests for comment regarding the outcome of the arraignment request.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the focus remains on the implications of Rahami's potential federal charges, which could significantly impact the case's trajectory. The situation continues to develop, with the federal government poised to take action in the coming days. 

The case against Ahmad Rahami, who is suspected of involvement in a bombing incident, has raised numerous legal questions and concerns about jurisdictional authority. With Rahami currently in local custody and the federal government preparing to take over the case, the next steps will be closely monitored by legal experts and the public alike. As the situation progresses, further updates are expected regarding the timeline for Rahami's arraignment and the specifics of the federal charges he will face.",-25.0,-29.0,471.0,-1.5625,-0.05307855626326964,468.0,-1.6111111111111112,-0.06196581196581197
Real_66-Webpage,US: ISIS did not use mustard agent in base attack,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL — OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

A final laboratory test has confirmed that the weapon fired at U.S. troops by ISIS did not contain a mustard agent, alleviating concerns surrounding the incident. The event took place at the Qayyara air base in northern Iraq on September 20, where initial tests had suggested the potential use of a chemical weapon. As a precaution, U.S. personnel underwent decontamination following the alarming results.

Col. John Dorrian, spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, announced that definitive lab results have shown no chemical weapon was employed in the attack. This conclusion comes after a series of tests, including one that returned negative results and another that was inconclusive. The final test ultimately confirmed the absence of any mustard agent.

The situation had escalated when Gen. Joseph Dunford previously assessed the weapon as a sulfur mustard blister agent during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. However, the latest findings have provided clarity and reassurance regarding the safety of U.S. forces stationed at the base.

This incident underscores the complexities and challenges faced by military personnel in combat zones, particularly concerning the threat of chemical warfare. The confirmation that no chemical agent was used marks a significant development in the ongoing efforts to combat ISIS and ensure the safety of troops deployed in the region.",-13.0,-7.0,260.0,-1.625,-0.05,242.0,-0.7,-0.028925619834710745
Real_67-Webpage,"Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say","The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.

""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.

Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.

A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.

The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.

""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.

He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""

James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.

""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.

""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg,"More Meghan,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997,"{""fb_title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@mkeneally"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-19"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-19 18:04:32"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race""}","- Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey and a stabbing attack in Minnesota have heightened focus on national security among presidential candidates.

In the wake of recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with a stabbing attack in Minnesota, national security has emerged as a critical issue in the ongoing presidential campaign. These violent incidents have sparked renewed discussions among candidates about their approaches to terrorism and safety, reflecting a growing concern among voters.

Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have publicly commented on the attacks, which resulted in numerous injuries, emphasizing the need for effective leadership in times of crisis. Their responses highlight the shifting dynamics of the race as candidates seek to reassure the public and assert their credentials on national security.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator, has weighed in on the potential impact of these terrorist events on voter behavior. He believes that such incidents are likely to heighten fear among the electorate, leading to increased support for candidates who are perceived as strong on security issues. Cohen's insights suggest that the recent attacks could significantly alter the landscape of the race, compelling candidates to adapt their strategies to address the electorate's concerns.

Before the attacks, national polls indicated that Clinton had a lead over Trump regarding trust in handling terrorism. An ABC News/Washington Post poll showed Clinton with a 50% approval rating among all adults, compared to Trump’s 41%. Among likely voters, Clinton maintained a narrow lead with 48% to Trump’s 45%. Similarly, a CBS/New York Times poll revealed that 49% of respondents preferred Clinton for managing terrorism and national security, while 45% favored Trump. The Quinnipiac poll echoed these sentiments, with Clinton at 49% and Trump at 47% in perceived effectiveness against terrorism.

Despite Clinton's lead, Cohen observes a notable shift in the public's perception of strength in national security, a domain traditionally dominated by Republicans. He notes that there is now a growing skepticism regarding Trump's understanding of terrorism, which could affect his standing among voters who prioritize security.

In response to the attacks, candidates are adjusting their campaign speeches to place a greater emphasis on national security. This strategic pivot reflects a recognition that voters are increasingly focused on safety and the effectiveness of their leaders in preventing future incidents.

However, Cohen has expressed concerns about the potential repercussions of Trump's rhetoric, particularly his proposals to ban foreign Muslims from entering the United States. He warns that such statements could inadvertently inspire further attacks, as they may be perceived as inflammatory and divisive.

James Campbell, a political science professor, offers an additional perspective on the implications of frequent terrorist events for the presidential race. He suggests that these incidents could bolster Trump's campaign by framing the current administration's foreign policy as ineffective. This narrative may resonate with voters who are disillusioned with the status quo and seeking a change in leadership.

Campbell further posits that the recent attacks may fuel support for stricter immigration policies, which align closely with Trump’s platform. As concerns about national security grow, voters may be more inclined to support candidates advocating for tighter immigration controls, viewing them as necessary measures to protect the nation.

As the presidential race unfolds, it is clear that national security will remain a pivotal issue. The recent attacks have not only heightened awareness among candidates but have also underscored the importance of voter perceptions regarding safety and leadership. With the election approaching, how candidates navigate these challenges may ultimately shape the outcome of the race, as the electorate grapples with the realities of terrorism and its implications for the future of the nation.",6.0,13.0,604.0,0.3333333333333333,0.009933774834437087,674.0,0.5,0.019287833827893175

When is the first general election presidential debate?

The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.

Story Continued Below

What time is the debate and how long is it?

The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.

How can I watch the debate?

It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.

Who will participate in the debate?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.

Who will moderate the debate?

Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.

What is the format of the debate?

The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.

Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?

Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.

What's at stake for Hillary Clinton?

The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.

What's at stake for Donald Trump?

Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again.

What is the most watched debate in presidential history?

In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.

What's the most-watched television moment of all time?

Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.

Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.

The stage is set for the first general election presidential debate of 2016, which will take place on September 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. The highly anticipated event will commence at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and is expected to last for 90 minutes without any commercial interruptions. This debate marks a pivotal moment in the election cycle as candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump prepare to engage in direct discourse on key issues facing the nation.

Broadcasting on all major television networks, cable news websites, and C-SPAN, the debate will reach a wide audience, drawing millions of viewers eager to witness the exchange of ideas and policies. With no other candidates qualifying for this debate, the focus will be solely on Clinton and Trump as they represent the two major political parties in the United States.

Lester Holt, the anchor of ""NBC Nightly News,"" will moderate the debate. This will be Holt's second time in this role during the 2016 presidential cycle, and he is expected to guide the conversation through a structured format consisting of six segments, each lasting 15 minutes. The format begins with a question from Holt, followed by two minutes for each candidate to provide their initial response. Following these responses, candidates will have the opportunity for rebuttal, allowing for a dynamic exchange of viewpoints.

Tentative topics for the debate include “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” However, these topics are subject to change based on current news developments, ensuring that the debate remains relevant to pressing issues facing the electorate.

Notably absent from the debate will be third-party candidates Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, who were not invited to participate as they failed to meet the 15% polling threshold established by the presidential debate commission. This exclusion has sparked discussions about the representation of alternative viewpoints in the electoral process, but the focus will remain on the two leading candidates.

For Hillary Clinton, the debate represents a critical opportunity to regain her polling lead and demonstrate her extensive policy knowledge and debate experience. As the former Secretary of State, Clinton is expected to leverage her background to address complex issues and present her vision for the future of the country.

Conversely, Donald Trump enters the debate with the chance to counteract criticisms regarding his policy knowledge and self-restraint. With expectations set relatively low for the Republican nominee, Trump may find an advantage in this dynamic, allowing him to surprise viewers and voters alike with his performance. The debate will serve as a platform for both candidates to solidify their positions and appeal to undecided voters.

Historically, presidential debates have garnered significant viewership, with the most-watched debate in history being the 1980 face-off between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, which attracted an impressive 80.6 million viewers. While the debate will undoubtedly draw a large audience, it is worth noting that the most-watched television moment in U.S. history remains Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, which captivated 114 million viewers. Furthermore, monumental global events such as the moon landing and the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana also commanded even larger audiences, illustrating the immense competition for viewers' attention.

As the debate approaches, anticipation continues to build among the electorate. Voters are keen to hear the candidates articulate their plans and respond to each other's critiques. The outcome of this debate could have significant implications for the trajectory of the election, as both candidates seek to sway public opinion and establish their narratives.

With the stakes higher than ever, Clinton and Trump will take to the stage to not only defend their positions but also to challenge each other on the issues that matter most to American voters. As the nation prepares for this pivotal moment in the electoral process, all eyes will be on Hofstra University, where the future of the 2016 presidential race may be shaped in real-time.",14.0,33.0,780.0,0.3684210526315789,0.017948717948717947,740.0,1.32,0.0445945945945946

Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday in Linden, N.J. | Nicolaus Czarnecki/Boston Herald via AP U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing.

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.

However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved.

""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""

The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.

Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.

While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.

The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.

Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.

Ahmad Khan Rahami is currently in custody after a dramatic shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. The incident has drawn significant attention as federal prosecutors resist a defense request for Rahami to be arraigned immediately on federal charges. This legal standoff raises questions about the next steps for Rahami, who faces serious state charges.

Defense attorneys for Rahami have requested a court proceeding to formally inform him of the charges against him and to clarify his rights. However, prosecutors have countered that Rahami is not in federal custody; rather, he is being held on state charges in New Jersey. As of now, a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged but remains unexecuted, indicating that no federal arrest has yet occurred.

Rahami is facing five charges of attempted murder related to the shootout, and a bail amount of $5.2 million has been set. He is presently hospitalized in Newark, and a county court appearance is scheduled for September 28. The circumstances surrounding his legal representation remain murky, with uncertainty about whether Rahami has been advised of his Miranda rights or if he has opted not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers have indicated that Rahami has not been cooperating with authorities, further complicating his legal situation.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch has indicated that Rahami would be moved to Manhattan in the near future, yet prosecutors have shown no urgency in executing this transfer. The federal prosecutors assert that Rahami has no rights within the federal system until he appears in court, which adds another layer of complexity to the case.

Federal Defenders in New York have expressed a desire to be appointed as Rahami's counsel. However, prosecutors have deemed this request ""premature,"" suggesting that the legal proceedings are still in a preliminary stage. No immediate action has been taken by the magistrate judge regarding the defense's arraignment request, leaving Rahami's future uncertain.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the implications of Rahami's case continue to resonate within the community and among legal experts.

Real_7-Webpage,Donald Trump's rise puts Ted Cruz in a bind,"Story highlights Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump earlier this year, but is under pressure to change his mind now

Cruz could face a primary challenge in 2018 from a fellow Republican

Washington (CNN) Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said.

JUST WATCHED Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife 01:51

On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them.""

Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

As the 2024 election approaches, Senator Ted Cruz is under increasing pressure to reconsider his previous refusal to endorse Donald Trump. This shift comes as Republican leaders, including Rep. Trent Franks, urge Cruz to back Trump in order to prevent a potential presidency for Hillary Clinton, which Franks warns could have dire consequences for the Constitution.

Franks, who was a supporter of Cruz during the GOP primary, emphasizes that failing to support Trump could enhance Clinton's chances of winning the election. He argues that a united front among Republicans is essential to thwart what he perceives as a significant threat to conservative values.

However, Cruz's supporters are divided on the issue. Some believe he should refrain from endorsing Trump to avoid alienating his base, which remains opposed to the former president. This internal conflict reflects the broader tensions within the Republican Party as it navigates the complexities of the upcoming election.

Adding to the discourse, Iowa radio host Steve Deace has pointed out that endorsing Trump would conflict with Cruz’s personal principles regarding political endorsements. With less than two months until Election Day, the pressure on Cruz intensifies as Trump’s poll numbers continue to rise.

The stakes are high; if Trump were to lose to Clinton by a narrow margin, there is a growing concern that his supporters might place blame on Cruz for not offering his endorsement. As the election nears, Cruz’s decision could have lasting implications not only for his political future but also for the Republican Party as a whole.",10.0,-1.0,294.0,1.1111111111111112,0.034013605442176874,298.0,-0.09090909090909091,-0.003355704697986577

Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks.

The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe.

“Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.”

Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.”

“They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”

Real_71-Webpage,Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible',"Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.

Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.

Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""

On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""

""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.

A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.

""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.

Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.

Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.

This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.

Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.

Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.

Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.

On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.

Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""

Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.

""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.

Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.

Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.

All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.

On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.

""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.

A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.

Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""

Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.

Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.

Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.

In a dramatic turn of events, former Port Authority executives and staffers from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s administration have come under scrutiny for their roles in orchestrating traffic disruptions at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013. The lane closures, which were aimed at Fort Lee, New Jersey, have been described as a calculated effort to exert political pressure on the town's mayor, Mark Sokolich, in a bid to secure his endorsement for Christie’s reelection.

David Wildstein, a former director at the Port Authority, took the stand to provide testimony that has raised eyebrows and questions about the ethical implications of the actions taken by Christie's team. Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and civil rights violations, is currently testifying under a plea deal, shedding light on the discussions that transpired between him and Bridget Kelly, Christie’s former deputy chief of staff.

According to Wildstein, the discussions centered around the idea of making traffic as problematic as possible in Fort Lee, a strategy he suggested to coerce Mayor Sokolich into backing Christie’s campaign. Sokolich, however, was reluctant to endorse the governor, fearing potential backlash from constituents in his predominantly Democratic town.

The timeline of events began on August 13, 2013, when Kelly sent an email to Wildstein discussing the creation of ""traffic problems"" in Fort Lee. This correspondence led to a follow-up phone call that confirmed the decision to implement lane closures. Wildstein did not express any reservations about the plan, stating that he was merely following orders from senior officials within the Port Authority.

In a calculated move, Wildstein organized the lane closures and maintained communication with both Kelly and former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni. The trio agreed to execute the closures without any advance notice to Fort Lee officials or the public, adopting a ""radio silence"" policy that Baroni had approved. This policy aimed to keep the operation under wraps, ensuring that there would be no forewarning about the impending traffic chaos.

Wildstein’s intentions were clear: he sought to ""maximize the impact"" on Fort Lee, strategically timing the lane closures to coincide with the first day of school on September 9. Initially, Wildstein had planned to close all three access lanes to the bridge but later decided to shut down two after consulting with engineers about the feasibility of the operation.

On September 6, just days before the closures were set to take effect, Wildstein informed Port Authority staff about the lane shutdowns. Despite concerns raised regarding potential traffic congestion, he directed staff to redirect any inquiries to Baroni’s office. In a bid to maintain the façade that the executive director was aware of the closures, Wildstein falsely claimed that Baroni had been informed.

As the first day of the closures unfolded, Wildstein witnessed the ensuing traffic buildup firsthand. He reached out to Kelly, who expressed satisfaction with the results of the operation. Meanwhile, Fort Lee officials, including Mayor Sokolich, attempted to reach out to Baroni and Wildstein for clarification, but their calls went unanswered, a direct consequence of the ""radio silence"" policy that had been put in place.

Wildstein’s testimony also highlighted Baroni's role in the situation, describing him as primarily focused on representing Christie's interests. Wildstein emphasized a ""one constituent rule,"" indicating that the opinions and directives from Christie were paramount in the decision-making process.

The fallout from the lane closures has not only implicated Wildstein but has also led to charges against Kelly and Baroni, who now face conspiracy and fraud charges related to the incident. Both Kelly and Baroni are expected to testify in their defense, potentially revealing further details about the inner workings of the Christie administration and its approach to political maneuvering.

As the trial continues, the implications of Wildstein’s testimony are profound, raising questions about the ethical boundaries of political strategy and the lengths to which officials may go to secure political endorsements. The incident has sparked outrage among constituents and has become a focal point of discussion regarding accountability in public office.

The George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal has not only tarnished the reputations of those involved but has also left a lasting impact on the political landscape in New Jersey. The actions taken by Christie's administration have been widely criticized, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability in government operations.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the public remains keenly interested in the testimonies that will emerge and the potential ramifications for those implicated in the scheme. The case serves as a stark reminder of the complexities of political ambition and the ethical dilemmas that can arise when public officials prioritize personal gain over the welfare of their constituents.

In conclusion, the testimony provided by David Wildstein has brought to light the intricate web of political maneuvering that characterized the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge. As the trial progresses, it will be crucial to examine the broader implications of this scandal on public trust in government and the need for ethical standards in political conduct. The outcome of this case may very well shape the future of political accountability in New Jersey and beyond.",9.0,-2.0,1009.0,0.225,0.008919722497522299,982.0,-0.06060606060606061,-0.002036659877800407

It's living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state

(CNN) Florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the November election.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched.

The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.

""So if I had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin,"" says USF Tampa political scientist Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor at the University of South Florida. ""We're to the point where anything is possible. This is just one of those kind of elections.""

All eyes are on central Florida's I-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. The area stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics.

A recent CNN/ORC poll reveals a tight race, with Trump leading at 47% and Clinton trailing at 44%, a difference that falls within the poll’s margin of error of 3.5%.

Real_74-Webpage,HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night’s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Here’s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday’s debate? — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet’s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

There’s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night’s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins aren’t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

@HuffingtonPost someone’s upset that #Trumpwins — Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? — Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ? pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y — Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn’t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate – except for the little watched @CNN poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, “Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN’s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.” They actually looks like they’re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

In the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, a CNN/ORC poll revealed that 62% of respondents believed Hillary Clinton emerged victorious. This finding has sparked discussions regarding the reliability of various polling methods, especially as numerous online polls claimed a decisive win for Donald Trump.

While traditional polling methods like those employed by CNN rely on contacting respondents directly, many online polls can often be skewed by the demographics and motivations of their audiences. The Huffington Post has criticized these online polls, labeling them as unreliable due to their susceptibility to manipulation. This sentiment raises questions about the validity of the results, with some polls showing Trump winning by a landslide.

Reports surfaced indicating that Trump supporters were actively manipulating online polls, particularly on platforms such as 4chan and Reddit. This manipulation has led to skepticism regarding the accuracy of the online polling results, as they may not represent a true reflection of public opinion. Critics argue that the audiences of these online platforms can significantly influence the outcomes, making it difficult to trust the findings.

Trump supporters have voiced their frustration with the coverage provided by the Huffington Post, asserting that the reporting has not accurately captured the sentiment of his base. Many Trump supporters have taken to social media to express their discontent, arguing that the mainstream media has a bias against their candidate.

In contrast to the CNN findings, Trump himself has claimed victory in nearly every poll, except for the one conducted by CNN. He pointed to trending hashtags on social media that purportedly supported his success in the debate. Furthermore, Trump shared anecdotes suggesting that most snap polls conducted immediately after the debate favored him, despite the more formal findings from CNN.

While the debate has stirred a significant amount of discourse across various platforms, the overall results from credible polling sources indicate that Hillary Clinton won the debate. The contrasting narratives from traditional and online polling methods highlight the complexities of gauging public opinion in the current political landscape.

As the election season progresses, the debate over polling accuracy and the influence of social media on public perception will likely continue. The disparity between CNN's findings and the results of online polls underscores the challenges faced by both candidates in navigating a polarized electorate. 

Ultimately, as the dust settles from the debate, the prevailing sentiment among traditional poll respondents leans towards a Clinton victory, while the online space remains a battleground of conflicting opinions. The implications of these differing results will undoubtedly play a role in shaping the narrative leading up to the election.",35.0,28.0,556.0,1.75,0.06294964028776978,484.0,1.4736842105263157,0.05785123966942149
Real_75-Webpage,Tim Kaine on Libertarian ticket: 'Everybody knows they're not going to win',"Story highlights Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine says third-party Libertarian candidates will lose

He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson

(CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose.

""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week.

Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history.

""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. It may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. That's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history.""

Real_76-Webpage,Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s Vice President Joe Biden.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday’s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

“This is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?”

Adding:

“Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

“He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘You’re fired.’ They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

“He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

“If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord… What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.”

And it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Watch Biden lay into Trump here:

Philadelphia, PA – Vice President Joe Biden took to the stage in Philadelphia on Thursday to rally support for Hillary Clinton, delivering a passionate critique of Donald Trump's recent remarks during a debate. The Vice President's comments focused on Trump's controversial statements regarding the housing market, which he deemed troubling and indicative of a broader disregard for American values.

Biden specifically questioned Trump's assertion that he benefited from the housing market's collapse, a claim that has raised eyebrows among many observers. ""How can anyone take pride in profiting from the suffering of others?"" Biden asked, highlighting the moral implications of Trump's comments. He emphasized that past presidents, including those from the Republican Party, upheld a moral center that respected the rights and values of all Americans. In stark contrast, Biden asserted that Trump lacks the fundamental sensibilities that have historically characterized American politicians.

The Vice President's anger was palpable as he condemned Trump's pride in not paying taxes, pointing out the unfair burden this places on everyday Americans who do contribute to the nation's tax system. ""While working-class families are struggling to make ends meet, Trump boasts about avoiding his civic responsibilities,"" Biden said. This sentiment resonated with the audience, as he expressed deep concern over the implications of such attitudes for the middle class.

Biden's remarks served to underscore a growing narrative within the Democratic campaign: the stark choice facing voters in the upcoming election. ""This election is about more than just policy; it's about who we are as a nation,"" he declared, firmly endorsing Hillary Clinton as the candidate who embodies the values and principles that Americans hold dear. He positioned Clinton as a leader who understands the challenges faced by working families and is committed to addressing them head-on.

The Vice President also expressed his concerns regarding Trump's cynicism towards the American people. ""We need a leader who believes in the potential of our nation and its citizens, not someone who sees them as a means to an end,"" Biden stated. His words resonated with the crowd, many of whom shared his frustration with the current political climate.

As the campaign progresses, Biden's critiques of Trump are likely to intensify, reflecting the broader Democratic strategy to draw clear distinctions between the two candidates. With the election fast approaching, Biden's impassioned defense of Clinton and his condemnation of Trump's rhetoric are expected to play a crucial role in mobilizing voters and reinforcing the Democratic message.

At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday.

The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.

Story Continued Below

The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.

The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.

""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""

In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.

“This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

In a troubling revelation, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) inspector general has reported that 858 individuals who were ordered to be deported were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship. This significant oversight has raised alarms regarding the integrity of the naturalization process and the systems in place to verify applicants’ eligibility.

The report indicates that these errors stemmed from incomplete fingerprint records within both the DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) repositories. The incomplete records primarily originate from the use of paper fingerprint cards prior to 2008, which were not consistently digitized. Additionally, there have been lapses in sharing fingerprint data from immigration enforcement with the FBI, further complicating the vetting process for citizenship applicants.

Despite the alarming number of individuals involved, the inspector general clarified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible. This statement suggests that while there may have been issues with their applications, it does not necessarily mean that all were granted citizenship incorrectly. The nuances of each case highlight the complexities involved in determining eligibility for citizenship.

In response to these findings, the DHS is actively working to address the problems associated with incomplete fingerprint records. The agency recognizes the critical importance of accurate record-keeping in the naturalization process and is committed to implementing measures to rectify these issues.

The report also revealed that some applicants with incomplete records faced denials in their citizenship applications. Furthermore, several cases are currently under criminal investigation or denaturalization proceedings, indicating that the implications of these errors may extend beyond mere administrative oversights.

Among the more concerning findings was the revelation that three previously-deported individuals had been granted citizenship and subsequently received security clearance for sensitive positions at airports and maritime facilities. However, their credentials have since been revoked, underscoring the potential risks associated with the mistakes in the citizenship process.

Inspector General John Roth emphasized the critical need for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to have access to comprehensive fingerprint records. He stated that such access is essential in preventing fraud and ensuring thorough reviews of naturalization applications. The call for improved access to fingerprint data highlights a significant gap in the current system that needs to be addressed to maintain the integrity of the immigration process.

The issue of immigration vetting has gained traction in political discourse, particularly with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump making it a key part of his campaign platform. Trump has advocated for stricter measures to ensure that individuals seeking citizenship are thoroughly vetted, emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures in the immigration process.

As the DHS works to rectify the issues highlighted in the inspector general's report, the implications of these findings will likely continue to resonate within the broader conversation about immigration policy and national security. The agency's commitment to improving its processes will be crucial in restoring public confidence in the naturalization system and ensuring that U.S. citizenship is granted only to those who meet the necessary criteria. 

In conclusion, the inspector general's report serves as a critical reminder of the importance of accuracy and diligence in the immigration process, as the consequences of oversight can have far-reaching implications for both national security and the individuals involved.",-16.0,1.0,559.0,-1.0,-0.028622540250447227,598.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0016722408026755853
Real_78-Webpage,Insiders: The heat is on Hillary,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.

Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.

Story Continued Below

That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.

“She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,” said a Nevada Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.”

“The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,” a New Hampshire Democrat added. “Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.”

One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.

“Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the Ohio Democrat. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.”

Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.

“Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an Ohio Republican. “Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.”

“She has to stop [Trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a Virginia Republican. “All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.”

Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans — most pointed to the GOP nominee’s volatile personality.

“Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,” said a Michigan Republican. “The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.”

“The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?” added a Michigan Democrat. “Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?”

Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:

Most insiders expect Clinton to “win” the debate.

Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

“Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,” said an Iowa Republican.

“[Clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a New Hampshire Democrat.

But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.

“The press wants Trump to win,” said a Florida Democrat. “Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.”

Some Republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction.

“The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,” a Virginia Republican said. “But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.”

Insiders think the debate will matter.

Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.

Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle.

“Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a Michigan Democrat predicted. “The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.”

The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact.

“Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.”

But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump’s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.

“If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an Iowa Republican. “If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.”

Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.

“We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,” an Iowa Republican said. “Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.”

Added a Florida Democrat: “Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.”

As the nation gears up for one of the most anticipated political showdowns of the election season, Hillary Clinton is experiencing mounting pressure to deliver a standout performance in her upcoming debate against Donald Trump. Insiders from both parties are voicing their concerns, highlighting the unique challenges Clinton faces as the first female major-party nominee and the heightened expectations placed on her.

A recent analysis from the POLITICO Caucus reveals that a significant majority of party members perceive an imbalance in scrutiny between the two candidates. According to the survey, 69% of Democrats and 74% of Republicans believe that Clinton is under more scrutiny than Trump. This perception underscores the double standards that many Democrats feel are at play, particularly as they express concerns over the low expectations set for Trump, who is often viewed as inexperienced on key issues.

An Ohio Democrat articulated the frustrations surrounding this double standard, noting that the pressure on Clinton is particularly intense given her historic candidacy. As the first woman to secure a major-party nomination, the expectations for her performance loom large, creating a unique set of challenges that her male counterparts have not faced to the same extent.

Republicans, while acknowledging the pressure on Clinton, are also aware of the shifting dynamics in the race. Recent polling indicates that Trump is gaining ground, which adds to the urgency for Clinton to perform well in the debate. Insiders suggest that a strong showing is crucial for Clinton to regain momentum and quell any lingering concerns about her health that have been raised in recent months.

Despite the pressure, a notable number of insiders remain optimistic about Clinton's chances in the debate. The POLITICO Caucus found that 76% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans expect Clinton to ""win"" the debate, a sentiment that reflects confidence in her ability to articulate her positions and counter Trump's arguments effectively. However, this optimism is tempered by concerns among some Democrats regarding potential media bias that may favor Trump. Many believe that the press could downplay Clinton's performance, further complicating her efforts to make a strong impression.

The debate is widely seen as a pivotal moment in the race, with insiders generally agreeing that it will have a significant impact on voter perceptions. Among Democrats, 66% believe the debate will benefit Clinton, while 52% of Republicans feel it will help Trump. This divide illustrates the differing expectations and hopes for the candidates as they prepare for the high-stakes confrontation.

However, even as anticipation builds, some insiders express skepticism about the long-term effects of the debate on voter sentiment. They point to the increasing polarization in the electorate and the unpopularity of both candidates as factors that may limit the debate's influence on undecided voters. In a landscape where many have already made up their minds, the potential for a debate to sway opinions could be diminished.

As the debate approaches, Clinton's team is acutely aware of the stakes involved. The pressure to perform is palpable, and both supporters and critics alike will be watching closely to see how she navigates the challenges ahead. In a race characterized by intense scrutiny and high expectations, the upcoming debate is poised to be a defining moment for Clinton as she seeks to solidify her position against a formidable opponent in Donald Trump. 

In summary, the upcoming debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shaping up to be a critical juncture in the election cycle. With heightened scrutiny on Clinton and a perception of a double standard in expectations, the pressure is on for her to deliver a strong performance. While many insiders predict a win for Clinton, concerns about media bias and the polarized political landscape cast a shadow over the potential impact of the debate on voter sentiment. As both candidates prepare for the showdown, the outcome remains uncertain, but its significance cannot be overstated.",43.0,30.0,2576.0,0.8431372549019608,0.016692546583850932,730.0,1.1111111111111112,0.0410958904109589
Real_79-Webpage,Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

In a recent commentary, Frank Wilkenmeyer has taken aim at Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, labeling their social media antics as dimwitted and suggesting they provide a wealth of material for humor. This criticism comes in light of Eric Trump's recent post that sparked ridicule, where he boasted about being featured in a crossword puzzle. The tone of Wilkenmeyer’s piece underscores a growing sentiment that the Trump brothers often miss the mark in their online expressions.

The critique of the Trump brothers is particularly salient against the backdrop of a national conversation regarding athlete protests, notably Colin Kaepernick's protests during the national anthem. In a tweet that garnered attention amidst this heated debate, Trump Jr. weighed in on the protests, which have become a focal point for discussions on race, patriotism, and freedom of speech. Many athletes have joined Kaepernick in protesting in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, drawing both support and backlash from various political factions.

Conservative voices, including Trump Jr., have accused Kaepernick of disrespecting the military and have called for an end to media coverage of these protests. This response highlights a significant divide in how protest actions are perceived across the political spectrum. On one side, conservatives argue that the protests undermine national pride and military sacrifices, while on the other, the left staunchly defends the athletes' right to express their dissent under the First Amendment.

Wilkenmeyer emphasizes that public criticism of these protests does not equate to government oppression. He points out that the First Amendment is designed to protect individual expression, a principle that conservatives often selectively uphold. The commentary notes a particular emphasis on the Second Amendment among conservative circles, suggesting a disparity in how constitutional rights are valued depending on the context. 

The piece further references the historical stance of the Supreme Court, which has consistently sided with free speech rights in cases involving protests and expressions of dissent. By invoking this legal precedent, Wilkenmeyer reinforces the argument that the right to protest and express differing opinions is a cornerstone of American democracy.

In contrasting the views on patriotism, the author reiterates that the First Amendment protects the right to express dissenting opinions, even if they clash with traditional notions of patriotism. While some may view the athletes’ protests as unpatriotic, others see them as a vital expression of the ongoing struggle for civil rights and social justice.

In conclusion, Wilkenmeyer’s critique serves not only as a commentary on the social media presence of the Trump brothers but also as a broader reflection on the current climate of political discourse in America. As the nation grapples with complex issues of race, freedom of expression, and the meaning of patriotism, the discussions surrounding these athlete protests and the responses from figures like Trump Jr. and Eric Trump highlight the ongoing tensions that define contemporary American society. The commentary invites readers to consider the implications of these discussions on the understanding and application of constitutional rights in everyday life.",-17.0,-14.0,592.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.028716216216216218,571.0,-0.7368421052631579,-0.024518388791593695
Real_8-Webpage,More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump! – Eagle Rising,"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.

The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category.

Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.

Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.

Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.

Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”. Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said.

Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”

In a political landscape that often seems divided and contentious, recent developments surrounding Donald Trump have sparked conversations that are sure to resonate across party lines. Following the publication of an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week,” it appears that the former president's rising popularity may have further irked liberals and “Never Trumpers.” The latest polls indicate a notable shift in support for Trump, with several surveys showing him leading former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in key battleground states.

According to a Fox News Poll, Trump has garnered 46% of support compared to Clinton's 45%. The LA Times/USC Poll shows Trump at 47%, leading Clinton by a significant 6 points. In a Suffolk University Poll, Trump maintains a 3-point edge with 42%, while the CNN/ORC Poll highlights a 4-point lead for Trump in Florida. These numbers suggest a narrowing gap between Trump and Clinton in critical states, with some shifting into “toss up” status, indicating a potential resurgence for Trump as the election cycle heats up.

In an effort to solidify his appeal to voters, Trump recently introduced a childcare policy plan during a speech in Aston, Pennsylvania. This initiative, led by his daughter Ivanka Trump, aims to address the pressing needs of families across the nation. The plan features several key components, including six weeks of paid maternity leave, childcare rebates for low-income families, and tax deductions for middle-class families. Furthermore, families will have the opportunity to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to cover tax-free childcare expenses, while stay-at-home parents will benefit from a new tax deduction. These measures reflect a strategic move to attract working families and underscore Trump's commitment to addressing family-oriented issues.

In addition to his childcare plan, Trump delivered another economic speech at the Economic Club of New York, further cementing his position as a candidate focused on economic growth and job creation. During this event, he also made an appearance on The Dr. Oz Show, where he shared insights into his medical history. Trump’s health was reported to be excellent, with the exception of being 15-20 pounds overweight. This revelation comes at a time when concerns about Hillary Clinton's health have been a topic of discussion, potentially providing Trump with an opportunity to contrast his vitality with his opponent's perceived vulnerabilities.

Trump's ability to engage with the public has also been showcased through his appearances on popular television programs. He made a notable guest appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, where he humorously allowed the host to mess up his hair. This light-hearted moment demonstrated Trump's willingness to laugh at himself and connect with a broader audience, showcasing a side of his personality that resonates with many voters.

Further solidifying his presence in the nation's capital, Trump recently opened a new hotel in Washington, D.C. The grand opening was marked by endorsements from military flag officers and Medal of Honor recipients, signaling strong support from influential figures within the military community. During this event, Trump took the opportunity to address the long-standing “birther issue,” unequivocally stating that President Barack Obama was born in the United States. This statement aimed to put to rest lingering doubts while also positioning Trump as a candidate who is willing to confront controversial topics head-on.

As the week unfolded, it became increasingly clear that Trump has experienced yet another “amazing week” in the public eye. His ability to navigate complex political landscapes, introduce significant policy initiatives, and engage with voters through humor and authenticity has contributed to his growing support. As the election cycle progresses, Trump's disregard for political correctness seems to resonate with a substantial portion of the electorate, further enhancing his appeal as a candidate who is unafraid to challenge the status quo.

In conclusion, the recent surge in support for Donald Trump, as reflected in various polls, combined with his proactive approach to policy and public engagement, paints a picture of a candidate who is not only surviving but thriving in a competitive political environment. With key battleground states shifting dynamics and a focus on family-oriented policies, Trump's strategy appears to be gaining traction. As the weeks unfold, it will be interesting to see how this momentum translates into voter sentiment and ultimately impacts the upcoming election.",59.0,89.0,1240.0,1.2291666666666667,0.04758064516129032,821.0,3.1785714285714284,0.10840438489646773
Real_80-Webpage,Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground,"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.

Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.

He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.

Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.

Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.

Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.

These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.

Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.

""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.

Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.

Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump.

""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.

Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.

Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""

The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.

Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.

TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.

This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.

""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""

Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""

Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""

""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""

This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.

Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.

In a notable shift in strategy, Donald Trump has increasingly focused his media engagements on Fox News, steering clear of other major networks. This change comes as the former president seeks to energize his base ahead of the upcoming elections, opting for friendly platforms that minimize exposure to tough questions from journalists.

Trump's frequent appearances on Fox shows, such as ""Fox & Friends"" and ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" highlight this new approach. He is also scheduled for an upcoming town hall with Sean Hannity, further solidifying his relationship with the network. By primarily engaging with Fox, Trump aims to rally his supporters, but this strategy raises concerns about his willingness to face challenging inquiries from the press.

While Trump’s surrogates assert that he is more accessible than his Democratic counterpart, Hillary Clinton, the evidence paints a different picture. Clinton has recently held multiple press conferences, showcasing her willingness to engage with reporters. In stark contrast, Trump has not conducted a press conference since July, leading to growing frustration among journalists eager for direct communication with the former president.

It has been over 50 days since Trump last faced a press conference, a notable absence that has not gone unnoticed. Reporters have expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of opportunities to question Trump, who has instead opted for appearances in non-journalistic settings. His recent television engagements include shows like ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" which allow him to present his message without the scrutiny that comes with traditional news interviews.

Interviews with major publications have also become increasingly rare for Trump. The last time he spoke with The New York Times was approximately a month ago, indicating a retreat from high-profile journalistic platforms. This decline in media accessibility contrasts sharply with earlier phases of his campaign, where Trump was more open to engaging with the press.

Trump's last appearance on CNN in late August saw him confronted with challenging questions, leading to speculation about his avoidance of tough interviewers. This trend suggests a calculated effort to shield himself from critical journalism, further emphasizing his focus on conservative audiences. By limiting his interactions to platforms that align with his views, Trump effectively protects himself from scrutiny that could arise in more diverse media environments.

The controlled nature of Trump's media messaging is exemplified by his relationship with Sean Hannity. Their collaboration includes numerous taped town halls, which allow Trump to present his ideas without the unpredictability of live questioning. This method of communication caters to a specific audience, ensuring that Trump can deliver his message in a favorable light.

Despite the strategic focus on energizing his base, Trump’s upcoming town hall scheduled for Wednesday raises eyebrows, particularly regarding its relevance to African-American issues. Hannity's viewership demographics show low representation of African-American audiences, prompting questions about the effectiveness of this event in truly addressing the concerns of this community. Critics may argue that this town hall is more about optics than substantive engagement.

As Trump continues to navigate the media landscape, his strategy of selective engagement is becoming increasingly apparent. By prioritizing appearances on Fox News and avoiding traditional press conferences, he is crafting a narrative that resonates with his core supporters while minimizing the risks associated with critical questioning.

In conclusion, Trump's media strategy reflects a deliberate choice to engage primarily with friendly outlets, reinforcing his connection with his base while sidestepping the challenges posed by traditional journalism. This approach has significant implications for his accessibility and transparency as a candidate, raising questions about the effectiveness of his communication strategy in reaching broader audiences. As the election season progresses, the impact of this media strategy on Trump's campaign will be closely monitored by both supporters and critics alike.",15.0,37.0,918.0,0.35714285714285715,0.016339869281045753,713.0,1.3214285714285714,0.051893408134642355

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.""

Pence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.

Former Vice President Mike Pence appeared on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour"" to discuss the Trump campaign's allegations against a recent Washington Post story. The Trump campaign has claimed that the Post's reporting contained ""inaccuracies and omissions,"" particularly regarding the use of funds from the Trump charitable foundation.

During the interview, Pence supported the campaign's assertion that the Post inaccurately reported that Donald Trump utilized $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues. He emphasized that there are ""a number of factual errors"" in the Post's story, echoing concerns raised about previous reporting on the Trump Foundation.

When pressed by host Brian Williams for specific examples of the alleged inaccuracies, Pence refrained from providing details. Instead, he expressed confidence that the Trump Foundation would address these inaccuracies and demonstrate its legal compliance in due course.

In a strategic shift, Pence redirected the conversation toward the Clinton Foundation, labeling it a ""larger issue"" in the realm of charitable organizations. He underscored the importance of transparency and accountability in philanthropic efforts, suggesting that the scrutiny faced by the Trump Foundation should also extend to its counterpart.

While defending the Trump campaign’s position, Pence reiterated his support for a free and independent press. He acknowledged the media's role in questioning the actions of the Trump Foundation while asserting that such inquiries should be rooted in factual accuracy.

Pence's appearance on the program highlights the ongoing tensions between the Trump campaign and media outlets, as well as the broader discourse surrounding the accountability of charitable foundations.",1.0,13.0,308.0,0.09090909090909091,0.003246753246753247,305.0,1.1818181818181819,0.04262295081967213
Real_82-Webpage,Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.

The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

New Jersey State Police

A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.

Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.

One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.

Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

New Jersey State Police

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.

""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""

Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.

Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

New Jersey State Police

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.

Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.

Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.

A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.

In a significant development in the investigation of explosive devices found in New York City and New Jersey, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, was captured today in Linden, New Jersey. His arrest follows a series of events that have drawn national attention and raised concerns about public safety in the region.

Rahami was born in Afghanistan in 1988 and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1995. Court records reveal that he is one of at least seven siblings. Growing up in New Jersey, he attended Edison High School, where former classmates described him as a quiet and funny individual, characterizing him as a ""pretty normal guy."" During his high school years, Rahami had a child with his girlfriend, further grounding his ties to the community.

After high school, Rahami enrolled at Middlesex County College in 2010, where he pursued an associate's degree in criminal justice. However, his academic journey was short-lived, as he did not graduate, leaving behind a trail of unfulfilled potential.

The Rahami family operated a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Ahmad worked and was known to be friendly with locals. Despite this seemingly ordinary life, the family has faced challenges, including conflicts with local law enforcement. In 2011, they sued the police for alleged harassment, although the case was dismissed the following year.

As investigators delve deeper into Rahami's background, they are scrutinizing his travel history, which includes a notable trip to Quetta, Pakistan, from April 2013 to March 2014 to visit family. This trip has raised questions about potential connections to extremist activities, prompting further examination.

Rahami's legal troubles began to surface in August 2014 when he was arrested for allegedly stabbing someone. However, he was not indicted in that case, leaving unanswered questions about his past behavior and potential for violence.

The recent events culminated in a dramatic confrontation with law enforcement. Rahami was captured after a shootout with police, during which he sustained at least one gunshot wound. Reports indicate that he is currently not cooperating with investigators, complicating efforts to ascertain the full extent of his actions and intentions.

In light of the charges against him, Rahami faces five counts of attempted murder and multiple weapons-related offenses. His bail has been set at a staggering $5.2 million, reflecting the severity of the allegations and the potential threat he posed to public safety.

The Afghan government has expressed its readiness to assist the United States in gathering information about Rahami, indicating a willingness to cooperate in the investigation. This collaboration may provide crucial insights into his background and any potential connections to extremist networks.

As the investigation continues, communities in New York and New Jersey remain on high alert, grappling with the implications of Rahami's actions and the broader issues of security and safety in urban environments. The capture of Ahmad Khan Rahami marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing efforts to address the threats posed by individuals who may be inspired by extremist ideologies.

Authorities are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities as they work to understand the full scope of the situation. The case serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration, integration, and the potential for violence that can arise from seemingly ordinary lives.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the focus will be on ensuring accountability and justice in the face of these serious charges. The Rahami case highlights the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement in preventing acts of violence and protecting communities from harm.

In the coming days and weeks, more details are expected to emerge as investigators piece together Rahami's actions and motivations. The situation remains fluid, and the public will be closely monitoring developments as they unfold.",-17.0,-30.0,735.0,-0.53125,-0.02312925170068027,719.0,-1.0,-0.04172461752433936

Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

“The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

“We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.

But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night.

“I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”

Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach.

“I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?”

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

“Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

“I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.”

Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.”

“The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.”

Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.

“They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”

In a bold move to connect with African-American voters, former President Donald Trump campaigned in a church located in a historically African-American community, positioning himself as a candidate capable of addressing urban issues. The event, held in Cleveland, was marked by Trump's controversial proposals and his attempts to reshape his image amid accusations of racism from his opponents.

The Cleveland church event featured Trump alongside the renowned boxing promoter Don King, who took the stage to praise Trump as a ""gladiator"" fighting against a political system that he claimed oppresses minorities. King's endorsement came despite his own complex history, which has seen him embroiled in controversies over the years. His presence, however, underscored Trump's strategy to garner support from influential figures within the African-American community.

During the campaign, Trump proposed the expansion of ""stop-and-frisk"" policing policies, a move that has drawn significant backlash from many black communities. Critics argue that such policies promote racial profiling and perpetuate systemic injustices. Nevertheless, Trump defended the approach during a town hall meeting with Fox News host Sean Hannity, asserting that stop-and-frisk had been successful in New York City. His remarks have reignited debates on the effectiveness and ethics of such policing strategies, particularly in communities already grappling with issues of trust and safety.

Despite his efforts to reach out, Trump's approval ratings among African-American voters remain notably low. Political analysts suggest that his outreach may be more aimed at appealing to moderate white voters than genuinely addressing the concerns of black communities. This sentiment is echoed by Rep. John Lewis, a prominent civil rights leader, who criticized Trump’s claim that conditions for African-Americans are worse than ever. Lewis questioned the validity of Trump's statement, indicating a disconnect between the former president's narrative and the lived experiences of many in the community.

At the Cleveland event, Trump sought to present himself as a candidate for all Americans. He surrounded himself with a diverse group of advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, attorney Michael Cohen, and former presidential candidate Ben Carson. This strategic move was likely intended to counteract the narrative of racial insensitivity and to showcase a more inclusive approach to governance.

In a moment that drew attention, Trump condemned the recent police shooting of an unarmed black man in Oklahoma. He suggested that the officer involved may have been ""choking"" during the incident, a comment that reflects his attempt to address police violence while also navigating the complexities of race relations in America. This statement, however, was met with mixed reactions, as many activists and community leaders continue to demand accountability and systemic change in law enforcement practices.

Cohen, who has been a staunch defender of Trump, took the opportunity to address media accusations of racism directed at the former president. He asserted that Trump views all individuals as part of the ""human race,"" attempting to frame his boss's actions and policies in a more favorable light. Cohen's defense highlights the ongoing struggle within Trump's campaign to reshape public perception and to mitigate the impact of past controversies that have tainted his relationship with minority communities.

Trump also took aim at the Democratic Party during his Cleveland appearance, accusing them of neglecting black voters and only seeking their support every four years during election cycles. This accusation aligns with a broader narrative that Trump has promoted throughout his political career, positioning himself as an alternative to what he describes as the failures of the Democratic establishment.

As Trump continues his campaign, his outreach efforts in African-American communities will likely remain a focal point of his strategy. Whether these efforts will translate into increased support or merely serve to bolster his appeal among moderate voters remains to be seen. The complexities of race, policing, and political engagement in America are intertwined, and as the 2024 election approaches, these issues will undoubtedly play a critical role in shaping the discourse.

In summary, Trump's campaign stop in the Cleveland church illustrates his dual strategy of addressing urban issues while also attempting to counteract accusations of racism. His proposals, particularly regarding stop-and-frisk, have reignited debates about policing and race relations, while endorsements from figures like Don King add a layer of complexity to his outreach efforts. As he continues to navigate these contentious waters, the response from African-American voters and community leaders will be pivotal in determining the effectiveness of his campaign's messaging.",-67.0,-10.0,1178.0,-1.8108108108108107,-0.056876061120543296,830.0,-0.3333333333333333,-0.012048192771084338

Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged.

“If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.”

Story Continued Below

Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.”

Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.

But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.”

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.”

Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.

Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.

“I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.”

He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.

“I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.

Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff known for his hard-line stance on immigration, has commented on Donald Trump's recent acknowledgment regarding Barack Obama's birthplace. While Trump has made headlines by recognizing Obama's birthplace, Arpaio pointed out that Trump did not go as far as to label Obama's birth certificate as ""legitimate."" This nuanced distinction has not gone unnoticed by Arpaio, who suggests that Trump's statement leaves lingering doubt about the authenticity of the document.

In a recent interview, Arpaio expressed that Trump's acknowledgment “didn’t bother” him, indicating that he is unfazed by the former president's shifting narrative on the matter. Arpaio, who previously launched an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama's birth certificate in August 2011, has long been a prominent figure in the birther movement. His investigation was part of a broader narrative that Trump capitalized on, falsely insinuating that Obama was not born in the United States—a claim that has been widely criticized as racist.

Despite Trump's recent attempts to downplay his birther claims amid mounting pressure, Arpaio remains steadfast in his convictions. Trump has sought to shift the blame for the birther rumors to Hillary Clinton, asserting that she was the one who initiated the discussion. However, Arpaio holds firm to his belief that Obama’s birth certificate is a forgery and insists that his investigation into the document is ongoing.

Arpaio emphasized that his inquiry is focused solely on the birth certificate itself, not on the question of where Obama was born. He has consistently denied any racist motivations behind his investigation, stating, “I have no idea now where he was born.” This admission adds an intriguing layer to his ongoing scrutiny of the birth certificate, as it suggests a level of uncertainty that contrasts with his previous assertions.

The former sheriff's investigation has not yielded any evidence that proves the birth certificate legitimate, and he is resolute in his stance that the document remains questionable. Arpaio's comments reflect a broader trend among some of Trump's supporters who continue to cling to the birther narrative, despite Trump's apparent retreat from the issue.

Interestingly, Arpaio confirmed that he did not have any discussions with Trump regarding the birth certificate issue prior to Trump's press conference. This lack of communication raises questions about the alignment of their views and the potential for collaboration on this contentious topic.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Arpaio's unwavering position on Obama's birth certificate serves as a reminder of the enduring impact of the birther movement. While Trump may have attempted to distance himself from the claims that once fueled his political rise, figures like Arpaio remain committed to questioning the legitimacy of Obama's documentation.

In a political environment where narratives can shift rapidly, Arpaio's comments are a testament to the complexities and controversies that surround the issue of presidential legitimacy. With ongoing investigations and public discourse surrounding the topic, the debate over Obama's birthplace and the authenticity of his birth certificate is far from over.",-9.0,-14.0,533.0,-0.5625,-0.016885553470919325,584.0,-0.7368421052631579,-0.023972602739726026
Real_85-Webpage,Barack Obama at Benjamin Netanyahu meeting: 'He is always very candid with us',"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month

His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office.

Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency.

""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us.""

That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January.

Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

In a pivotal meeting, President Obama convened with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an effort to mend their historically strained relationship.

During the 30-minute meeting, which is likely to be their last face-to-face consultation before a new president assumes office in January, Obama articulated his hope for a deeper understanding of Israel's future challenges and the opportunities that may arise for stability and peace in the region. This meeting comes at a time when the relationship has been marred by Netanyahu’s candid criticisms of U.S. policies, particularly concerning the contentious nuclear agreement with Iran.

Despite the personal tensions that have characterized their interactions, Obama remains committed to strengthening U.S.-Israel ties for the benefit of his successor. The meeting underscores the importance of continued dialogue and cooperation between the two nations, especially as they navigate the complexities of regional security and diplomatic relations.

As the clock ticks down on Obama's presidency, the meeting serves as a crucial moment for both leaders to reflect on their legacies and the future of U.S.-Israel relations. With peace in the region still an elusive goal, the outcomes of this meeting may have lasting implications for both nations as they look ahead to the next chapter in their diplomatic history.",25.0,16.0,300.0,2.7777777777777777,0.08333333333333333,272.0,2.0,0.058823529411764705
Real_86-Webpage,McAuliffe hangs with Willie Nelson -- and his weed,"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana

Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert

(CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed.

It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!""

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is.

""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool.""

The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

Real_87-Webpage,The Mystery of Trump’s Man in Moscow: Carter Page,"In March, in a bold “Oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the Washington Post’s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, “I have quite a few more.” The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “Carter Page, PhD.”

Who?

Story Continued Below

Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.”

This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.

“What’s this guy’s name?” says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.

“I had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. “But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘Have you heard of this guy?’”

“Strangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,” Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. “It's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.”

Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.

This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. “I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.” As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?

Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (“I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’” says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump’s own campaign.

What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. “He’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,” says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia’s state oil giant. “People really respect him in this industry. He’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials—including Rosneft head Igor Sechin—during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.

Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at Gazprom,” the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in Russia” and an office “around the corner from Trump Tower.”

Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, “Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a “famous American economist” and “adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.”

All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in Trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.

But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to Page’s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.

So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?

***

I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page’s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.

This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.

OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn’t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive résumé.

Page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. “He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,” his bio reads. “He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.”

Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page’s tenure in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.

So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn’t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “I don’t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says Craig . “It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.”

When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page’s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, “I rolled my eyes at that one.” (He, too, said he hadn’t heard of Page until Trump’s announcement.)

Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?

Turns out, they did.

“His nickname was stranichkin,” from the Russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. “It really irritated our team,” Torchinsky told me over Skype. “We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. These guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” As for Page, “He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” Torchinsky says. “When you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.”

OK, harsh. But then I talked to Page’s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. “He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me.

Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says Aleksashenko.

When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” And, says Aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.”

Trump’s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says Aleksashenko.

***

For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,” he wrote. “Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (“Slave; Pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.

His speech in Moscow’s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “For the last 15 years, I’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak Russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: “We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.” Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.

Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. “He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “That blog post about the slaves. That’s just … strange,” says the Council member.

“He’s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. “You’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.”

***

I should’ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump’s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.

I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page’s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?

But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch’s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “No one let him into Gazprom,” Aleksashenko says. “He didn’t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller’s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.” Another of Page’s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page’s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year… I used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.”

But the meetings did provide him with something else. “Gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them.

After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father’s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from Trump Tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space.

“That’s Carter Page,” says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. “That’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. He’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.”

In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia’s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“I don’t know this person,” said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page’s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. “I give them money, I don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,” he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “Don’t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.”

“You are engaged in onanism,” said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. “It’s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It’s absurd.”

As for the FBI investigation, well, it’s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.” He added, “the story doesn't add up.” What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page’s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.”

***

I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?

“Who?” says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.

“He has no formal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.

Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks’s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?

One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.

One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump’s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,” Burt told me. “And I told him I’d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I’ve forgotten. He’s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?”

Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump’s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. “If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,” this person told me.

“I’m not answering your questions,” Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “Carter Page isn’t someone I’ve interacted with.” Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: “Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He’s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.”

***

Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“Who?” Maybe I wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.

“I don’t know about his Russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. “Every conversation I’ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” He went on. “I couldn’t name a project that I could connect Carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.”

“I don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but I think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.”

Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, “a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ‘I want to be part of the team,’” says the Trump adviser. And that’s how it happened. “He’s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ‘He’s an adviser.’ And now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.”

Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,” one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,” the Russia specialist recalls. “He didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.”

According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page’s trip to Russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.” But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “It’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America’s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It’s what’s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carré novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?”

This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “If Page using his status as ‘Trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: “Carter Page, Ph.D.” Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.

For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?

There doesn’t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,” Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.

In March, during a pivotal interview, former President Donald Trump unveiled a short list of foreign policy advisers, among whom was Carter Page, PhD. This announcement marked a significant moment in the political landscape, particularly as Trump’s foreign policy approach has been scrutinized since his initial campaign for the presidency. Page, who is the founder of Global Energy Capital, presented himself as a figure with extensive experience in Russia and the energy sector. However, the reality surrounding Page’s credentials and connections has sparked a wave of skepticism and concern.

Carter Page’s self-proclaimed expertise in the energy sector, particularly regarding Russia, has not been universally accepted. Many experts in both the fields of Russian affairs and energy have expressed confusion, stating they have never heard of Page prior to his association with the Trump campaign. This disconnect raises questions about the validity of Page’s claims and the implications of his advisory role. Despite his assertions of influence, the lack of recognition from seasoned professionals in these domains casts a shadow over his qualifications.

In his statements, Page has indicated that he has been actively engaged in sending policy memos to the Trump campaign, focusing specifically on energy policy and relations with Russia. His involvement suggests a level of engagement that could potentially shape the Trump administration’s approach to these critical areas. However, the context surrounding his advisory role has been complicated by reports indicating that Page is currently under investigation by U.S. intelligence agencies for alleged ties to Russian leaders. This investigation adds a layer of complexity to his involvement, as it intertwines Page’s activities with broader concerns regarding Russian interference in U.S. politics.

The selection of Page as a foreign policy adviser has not only raised eyebrows due to his questionable credentials but also because of Trump’s own lack of foreign policy expertise. This situation has led to growing concerns among political analysts and foreign policy specialists. Many experienced advisers have distanced themselves from Trump, fearing that their reputations could be tarnished by association with a campaign perceived as lacking serious foreign policy understanding. Page’s presence on the advisory list further complicates this narrative, as it suggests a reliance on individuals whose qualifications are under scrutiny.

Media portrayals of Page have often framed him as a well-connected businessman with substantial ties to Russian energy executives. However, this image is met with skepticism from industry insiders who question the depth of Page’s connections and influence. Despite the narratives spun around him, many in the energy sector have described Page as a figure lacking significant skills or connections that would warrant such a portrayal. This discrepancy between media representation and industry perception raises critical questions about the motivations and realities of Page’s involvement in the Trump campaign.

Adding to the controversy surrounding Page are his public statements, which have often been polarizing. He has been noted for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin while criticizing former President Barack Obama’s foreign policy. Such remarks not only reflect Page’s personal views but also raise alarms regarding the potential implications for U.S. foreign policy if he were to have a significant role within the Trump administration. The juxtaposition of his admiration for Putin against the backdrop of U.S. national interests presents a troubling scenario for many observers.

Page’s professional background includes a vice presidency at Merrill Lynch, a position that ostensibly adds to his credentials. However, former colleagues have described him as lacking the significant skills or connections typically associated with such a role. This characterization further undermines Page’s claims of expertise and influence in the energy sector, leading to questions about the authenticity of his professional narrative. Such doubts are compounded by the fact that his energy fund is registered at his father’s address, raising suspicions about the legitimacy and operational capacity of his business endeavors.

As Page’s involvement with the Trump campaign continues to unfold, questions about his role and influence have emerged. Some campaign officials have asserted that Page has no formal role or significant influence within the campaign structure. This assertion, if accurate, suggests a disconnect between Page’s public persona as an adviser and his actual standing within the campaign. The ambiguity surrounding his influence highlights the challenges faced by the Trump campaign in establishing a coherent foreign policy strategy.

Furthermore, investigations into Page’s connections and activities in Russia persist, complicating the narrative of his involvement with the Trump campaign. These investigations are part of a broader examination of potential Russian interference in U.S. politics and the implications of such actions for national security. As these inquiries continue, they cast a long shadow over Page’s role and the Trump campaign’s foreign policy direction.

In conclusion, the intricate web of connections between Donald Trump, Carter Page, and Russian interests illustrates the complexities of the current political landscape. Page’s self-portrayal as an expert in energy and Russia is met with skepticism from both industry insiders and political analysts, raising questions about the motivations behind his advisory role. As investigations unfold and the implications of Russian interference remain a pressing concern, the situation surrounding Page and his connections to the Trump campaign becomes increasingly murky. The reflections on this complex scenario reveal the challenges faced by the Trump administration as it navigates foreign policy in a landscape fraught with uncertainty and controversy.",27.0,-15.0,6589.0,0.12796208530805686,0.004097738655334649,1023.0,-0.38461538461538464,-0.01466275659824047
Real_88-Webpage,It’s “Trump is HITLER” Month at the Washington Post – Eagle Rising,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post.

On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part,

(…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is.

Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

Six Day’s before Mr. Cohen, another columnist Shalom Auslander wrote, “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles…

The newspaper has notably assigned a team of 20 reporters to investigate Trump, a move that has raised eyebrows among his supporters and critics alike.

Columnists at the publication have drawn controversial parallels between Trump and Adolf Hitler, stirring further debate. Richard Cohen, in a recent column, suggested that Trump exhibits ""Hitlerian"" thinking, although he clarified that he does not believe Trump is an anti-Semite. This assertion has sparked outrage, particularly as Cohen refrains from making similar comparisons regarding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, leading to accusations of a double standard in the newspaper's coverage.

Adding to the discourse, columnist Shalom Auslander cautioned against such comparisons, arguing that equating Trump with Hitler diminishes the historical significance of the Holocaust and trivializes the atrocities associated with it. His remarks reflect a growing concern among some commentators about the implications of invoking Hitler in contemporary political discussions.

Real_89-Webpage,Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore,"2016 Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore The president’s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.

They’re not laughing anymore.

Story Continued Below

Going into Monday night’s debate, Obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.

“I’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “I feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘Breaking Bad’ here. We’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.”

“There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,” said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.

Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He’s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare—support Democrats.

For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there’s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.

“We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. “But we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.”

Trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.

And the result: Trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama’s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.

Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.

“I don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, I don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.”

But they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama’s America.

“I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. “He’s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.”

For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “Trump has shattered that,” Vietor said. “He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. That’s a bad lesson for people to learn.”

According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton’s chances.

“I’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.

Not everyone’s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.

“He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.

And Democrats’ sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.

“The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,” said Earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.”

But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.

“I’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” Papa said, “than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the atmosphere surrounding former President Barack Obama’s team has undergone a significant transformation. Initially, the emergence of Donald Trump as a dominant figure within the Republican Party elicited laughter and bemusement from Obama’s aides. However, recent developments have shifted their perspective from amusement to deep concern regarding the implications of Trump’s political rise.

Aides who once found humor in Trump’s takeover of the GOP are now expressing anxiety about the broader segment of America that Trump appears to represent. This realization has sparked a wave of apprehension not only among Obama’s staff but also among some of the top aides from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. The shared worry is particularly focused on the potential backlash against Obama’s legacy, as Trump’s aggressive political style and rhetoric challenge the ideals that Obama championed during his presidency.

Former White House aide Ben LaBolt encapsulated this dramatic shift in sentiment, likening the current political landscape to a serious drama. The laughter that once accompanied discussions about the GOP's self-destruction has been replaced by a palpable fear of what Trump’s influence could mean for the future of American politics. Obama himself has expressed mixed feelings in private conversations; while he finds amusement in the struggles of the Republican Party, he is also frustrated by his inability to connect with certain segments of the American populace.

The rise of Trump serves as a stark reminder of the shortcomings in delivering on the promises of hope and progress that Obama sought to embody during his administration. With Trump mainstreaming racist rhetoric and garnering substantial grassroots support, concerns have escalated among former aides about the lasting damage he has inflicted on the political landscape. Polls indicating that Trump and Clinton are nearly tied with just 43 days left before the election only heighten these worries.

Obama’s aides, who once joked about the GOP’s self-inflicted wounds, have now firmly rejected the notion that Trumpism could be considered a part of Obama’s legacy. The aggressive political style that Trump embodies stands in stark contrast to Obama’s calls for respectful disagreement and civil discourse. This divergence underscores the frustrations felt by Obama and his team, who had hoped for a functional opposition that could engage in meaningful negotiations on key issues.

Despite the prevailing sense of grief over the current state of American politics and the rise of extremist views, some former aides maintain a glimmer of optimism. They point to the ongoing internal struggles within the GOP as a potential avenue for change, believing that Trump’s actions may ultimately lead to a reckoning within the party. However, this optimism is tempered by the recognition that the economic critiques leveled by Republicans against Democratic policies appear hypocritical, especially in light of the recovery experienced under Obama’s administration.

The sentiment among Obama’s aides reflects a deep concern for the future of American democracy. As they navigate the complexities of a political landscape increasingly defined by division and extremism, the anxiety surrounding Trump’s influence continues to grow. The implications of this shift resonate not only within the confines of Obama’s team but also across the broader political spectrum, as the nation grapples with the challenges posed by a resurgent populism and the enduring legacy of Obama’s presidency.

In conclusion, the evolving sentiment among Obama’s aides highlights the profound impact that Trump’s ascendance has had on American politics. Moving from humor to fear, the concerns surrounding the potential backlash against Obama’s legacy and the lasting damage inflicted by Trump underscore a pivotal moment in the nation’s political discourse. As the election draws closer, the stakes have never been higher, and the need for a return to civility and respectful disagreement has never been more pressing.",-9.0,-17.0,1354.0,-0.24324324324324326,-0.0066469719350073855,733.0,-0.7083333333333334,-0.023192360163710776

Real_90-Webpage,Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

“Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”

Adding:

“This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”

Chelsea then said:

“Stop telling women to smile. We don’t like that. It’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”

Going for Priebus’ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

“You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.”

And that’s exactly right.

Handler addressed Priebus's comments on her Netflix show, questioning his authority to dictate when a woman should smile.

Real_91-Webpage,Is Donald Trump qualified to be president?,"Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.

H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.”

Likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.

Story Continued Below

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.

But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump’s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?

1. Does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country?

Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump — who swooned after Clinton’s superb convention in Philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.

His resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.

The first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream.

This is not to suggest that Trump can’t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.

Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates — but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care.

The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. “When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.”

Stone argued that Trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.

Trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.

Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD’s Section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?

2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?

Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: “We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.”

That’s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: “For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “Article 12 of the Constitution.” The framers stopped at seven. “He was just listing out numbers,” said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. “I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.”

OK, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “Free Exercise” clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.

3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?

Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.

But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.

Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much).

More serious is the issue of Trump’s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns.

This isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.

4. What’s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there’s the matter of Trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In exposé after exposé, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.

The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.

5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.

But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.

Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary” in Trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.

But it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially George W. Bush’s claims about Iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read POLITICO’s comprehensive “Donald Trump’s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths” for a taste.)

In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “Clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…”

But getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. It’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.

As the first presidential debate of 2016 approaches, the qualifications of Donald Trump for the highest office in the United States come under intense scrutiny. Unlike his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who has been subjected to a prolonged history of public examination, Trump enters the race as an opaque candidate. This lack of thorough vetting raises significant questions regarding his readiness to lead the nation.

Trump’s campaign has been characterized by broad, sweeping ideas rather than a nuanced understanding of the facts and history that underpin effective governance. As voters prepare to make a pivotal decision, five critical questions emerge that demand answers to ascertain Trump’s qualifications for the presidency.

1. **Does he possess the basic knowledge required to run the country competently?**

The fundamental expectation of any presidential candidate is a solid grasp of the basic knowledge necessary to govern effectively. This includes an understanding of domestic and foreign policy, economic principles, and the complexities of federal governance. Trump's rhetoric often lacks specificity, leaving many to wonder whether he possesses the requisite knowledge to navigate the intricate landscape of national and international issues. 

2. **Does he understand and respect American Constitutional principles?**

The Constitution serves as the bedrock of American democracy, and a president’s respect for its principles is paramount. Questions arise about Trump’s understanding of constitutional governance, particularly regarding the separation of powers, checks and balances, and the rights of citizens. His statements and actions have at times suggested a disregard for these foundational elements, prompting concerns about his commitment to uphold the Constitution if elected.

3. **Why won't he answer questions about his businesses and debts?**

Transparency is a cornerstone of democratic governance, and voters have a right to know the financial dealings of their potential leaders. Trump’s reluctance to provide clarity about his business interests and debts raises red flags. The absence of straightforward answers creates an environment of suspicion and uncertainty, leaving voters to question whether he is hiding crucial information that could impact his ability to govern impartially.

4. **What is the status of his charitable foundation?**

Philanthropy can reflect a candidate’s values and priorities, yet Trump’s charitable foundation has faced scrutiny over its operations and transparency. Understanding the nature of his charitable activities is essential for voters who wish to gauge his commitment to public service and social responsibility. The lack of clarity surrounding the foundation's status prompts further inquiry into his motivations and integrity.

5. **Why does he frequently lie or distort the truth?**

Trustworthiness is a vital attribute for any leader, and Trump’s frequent deviations from factual accuracy raise concerns about his credibility. The tendency to lie or distort the truth undermines the very fabric of democratic discourse, where informed decision-making relies on honest communication. Voters must grapple with the implications of supporting a candidate who has demonstrated a pattern of misleading statements.

While Trump may possess a unique ability to connect with voters on a personal level, this skill does not necessarily translate into readiness for governance. The distinction between charisma and competence is crucial; a candidate’s ability to resonate with the electorate should not overshadow the necessity for intellectual curiosity and a solid grounding in factual knowledge.

Moreover, Trump’s approach to the media has raised alarms regarding press freedoms. His threats against journalists and attempts to delegitimize critical reporting are reminiscent of authoritarian tactics that undermine democratic norms. A president must embrace the role of a transparent leader willing to engage with the press, rather than one who seeks to silence dissenting voices.

When comparing Trump to past presidents, it becomes evident that a deep understanding of governance and a commitment to factual accuracy have historically been essential traits of effective leaders. The ability to engage with complex issues, build coalitions, and communicate truthfully with the public are hallmarks of successful presidencies. As voters evaluate Trump’s candidacy, they must consider whether he embodies these qualities.

Ultimately, the electorate deserves a comprehensive understanding of Trump’s actual qualifications and financial status to make an informed decision. The stakes of the upcoming election are extraordinarily high, and voters must possess the necessary information to assess whether Trump is truly fit to lead the country. As the debate looms, the questions surrounding his candidacy remain pressing and unresolved, demanding clarity and accountability from the candidate himself.",18.0,50.0,2547.0,0.21686746987951808,0.007067137809187279,854.0,1.2195121951219512,0.0585480093676815
