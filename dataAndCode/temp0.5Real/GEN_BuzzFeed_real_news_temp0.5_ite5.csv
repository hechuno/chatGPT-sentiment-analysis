Real_1-Webpage,Another Terrorist Attack in NYC…Why Are we STILL Being Politically Correct – Eagle Rising,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

On the night of September 17, 2016, Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood was rocked by an explosion that injured 29 individuals and caused significant property damage. The incident, which occurred on West 23rd Street, was attributed to a homemade bomb that had been placed in a dumpster. Fortunately, there were no fatalities reported in the aftermath of the blast, but the event underscored the ongoing concerns regarding public safety and the threat of terrorism in urban areas.

The explosion prompted an immediate response from law enforcement, who swiftly removed the explosive device at 2:25 AM. The device was subsequently sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis, as authorities sought to understand the nature of the bomb and the motivations behind its placement. In a related discovery, a second device, similar in design to the bomb used in the Boston Marathon bombing, was located on West 27th Street. This raised alarms about the potential for further attacks and the need for vigilance in the face of such threats.

By the following Sunday morning, all individuals who had sustained injuries from the explosion had been released from the hospital, marking a small relief amid the chaos. However, the incident was not an isolated event; it followed a bomb explosion in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, which occurred during a charity race. Fortunately, that incident also resulted in no casualties, but it highlighted a troubling pattern of violence linked to public gatherings.

Law enforcement agencies quickly established connections between the explosives used in New York and New Jersey, suggesting that they were the work of the same suspect. This revelation intensified the urgency for a coordinated response and heightened the scrutiny of security measures in both states. The incidents fed into a broader narrative about the growing prevalence of terrorism and the challenges it poses, particularly in an environment where political correctness often complicates discussions about security.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the situation, emphasizing that, while there was no specific credible threat from terror organizations, the act was clearly intentional. His comments reflected a commitment to transparency and public safety, as he sought to reassure New Yorkers in the wake of the explosion. Meanwhile, Police Commissioner James O’Neill ruled out the possibility of a natural gas leak as the cause of the explosion, further confirming the deliberate nature of the attack.

Governor Andrew Cuomo also weighed in on the situation, declaring that a bomb explosion constitutes an act of terrorism, regardless of the absence of evidence pointing to international involvement. His assertion underscored the seriousness with which officials were treating the incident and the potential implications for public policy and law enforcement moving forward.

The explosion in Chelsea drew national attention, prompting responses from prominent political figures, including presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Clinton took the opportunity to emphasize the importance of supporting first responders who put their lives on the line in such emergencies. She highlighted the need for unity and resilience in the face of violence, urging citizens to come together to support those affected by the incident.

In contrast, Donald Trump called for a tougher stance in response to acts of terrorism, reflecting his campaign's focus on security and law enforcement. His comments resonated with a segment of the population that prioritizes strong leadership and decisive action in the face of threats, echoing a broader sentiment that has gained traction in recent years.

As the dust settled in Chelsea, the incident served as a stark reminder of the persistent threat of terrorism in urban environments. The need for strong leadership to protect citizens from various forms of terrorism has never been more pressing. Community resilience, effective law enforcement, and a commitment to addressing the root causes of violence are essential components of a comprehensive strategy to safeguard public spaces.

In the wake of the explosion, discussions around terrorism have become increasingly complex, particularly as they intersect with issues of political correctness and public safety. The balance between maintaining civil liberties and ensuring the security of citizens is a delicate one, requiring thoughtful consideration and proactive measures.

As New Yorkers and citizens across the nation reflect on the Chelsea explosion, the call for robust leadership is clear. The events of that night, coupled with the subsequent discoveries in New Jersey, highlight the urgent need for a unified approach to combating terrorism and ensuring the safety of public spaces. The resilience of communities, combined with the vigilance of law enforcement, will be crucial in navigating the challenges that lie ahead.

In conclusion, the explosion in Chelsea serves as a reminder of the ever-present threat of violence and the importance of strong leadership in addressing these challenges. As communities come together to support one another, it is imperative that officials remain committed to safeguarding public safety and fostering an environment where citizens can feel secure in their daily lives. The path forward will require collaboration, vigilance, and an unwavering commitment to protecting the values that define a free and open society.",-43.0,17.0,930.0,-1.2285714285714286,-0.046236559139784944,940.0,0.5,0.018085106382978722
Real_10-Webpage,"Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests","Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.

""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.

The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.

""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""

He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.

""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""

But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.

Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.

During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""

Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.

Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.

""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.

In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",http://abcn.ws/2d4lNn9,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg,"More Candace,Adam Kelsey,Abc News,More Adam",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437,"{""fb_title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@adam_kels"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-22"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-22"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-22 14:33:00"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh""}","- Protests erupted in North Carolina following the police killing of African-American man Keith Lamont Scott.

In the wake of the police killing of African-American man Keith Lamont Scott, protests erupted across North Carolina, reflecting a growing frustration among communities regarding systemic issues of police violence and accountability. The incident, which has sparked outrage, has become a focal point for discussions surrounding race relations and law enforcement practices in the United States.

Amid the turmoil, Donald Trump addressed the unrest during his speech at the Shale Insight 2016 Conference, attributing some of the chaos to drug-related issues. His comments came as communities rallied in response to the tragic events, highlighting a disconnect between the political narrative and the lived experiences of those affected by police violence.

In his address, Trump condemned the violence that erupted during the protests, calling for unity and emphasizing the importance of public safety. His remarks were aimed at fostering a sense of solidarity amid the rising tensions, yet they failed to acknowledge the broader patterns of police violence that disproportionately affect African-American communities. Many protesters have voiced their concerns about systemic discrimination and the lack of accountability for police killings, arguing that these issues are central to the unrest.

While Trump has made efforts to reach out to black Americans, questioning what they have to lose by voting for him, his statements have often been met with skepticism. His characterization of inner cities as being in poor condition for African-American communities has drawn criticism, with many arguing that such comments perpetuate stereotypes and fail to capture the complexity of urban life.

In a bid to connect with African-American voters, Trump visited a black church in Cleveland, where he engaged with the community on various issues. During a town hall meeting, he discussed the controversial concept of ""stop and frisk,"" which has been criticized for its potential to disproportionately affect minority populations. Following the backlash, Trump clarified that his comments were intended to apply specifically to Chicago, yet the discussion underscored the challenges he faces in addressing the concerns of black Americans.

Throughout his remarks, Trump made a distinction between what he referred to as ""violent disruptors"" and the broader black community. He emphasized the need to improve life for African-American families, suggesting a commitment to addressing the issues that matter most to these communities. However, many critics argue that without acknowledging the historical context of systemic racism and police violence, such efforts may fall short.

The protests following the death of Keith Lamont Scott are a stark reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by African-American communities in their fight for justice and equality. As demonstrators take to the streets, they are not only demanding accountability for police actions but also calling for a broader examination of the systemic issues that contribute to violence and discrimination.

In this climate of unrest, the need for dialogue and understanding has never been more critical. Advocates for change are urging leaders, including Trump, to engage in meaningful conversations about race, justice, and public safety, rather than offering platitudes that fail to address the root causes of the issues at hand.

As the situation in North Carolina continues to unfold, the eyes of the nation remain focused on the protests and the conversations they inspire. The tragic death of Keith Lamont Scott has become a catalyst for change, prompting a renewed examination of the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The call for accountability and justice echoes loudly, as activists strive to ensure that their voices are heard in the ongoing struggle for equality.

In the coming weeks, it will be crucial for both political leaders and community members to engage in constructive dialogue that acknowledges the complexities of these issues. The protests may serve as a turning point, not only for North Carolina but for the nation as a whole, as communities seek to forge a path toward healing and understanding.

As discussions surrounding the protests and police violence continue, the importance of unity and collaboration cannot be overstated.

Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.

Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”

So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.

Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.

How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right?

In a significant address to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama emphasized the critical need for a balance between liberty and security in the contemporary global landscape. His remarks focused on the responsibilities of powerful nations, particularly the United States, to accept certain constraints that could enhance security and foster international cooperation.

Obama asserted that the complexities of today’s world demand that nations, especially those with considerable influence, must be willing to relinquish some degree of freedom of action. He argued that such sacrifices are not merely necessary but essential for achieving long-term security. The former president underscored the importance of adhering to international norms, suggesting that compliance with these standards is integral to building a more stable and secure global environment.

Central to Obama’s argument was the role of humanitarian actions in promoting national security. He specifically linked the acceptance of Muslim refugees to the broader goal of global stability, positing that extending help to those in need is a vital component of securing a peaceful international order. By welcoming refugees, Obama contended, nations can contribute positively to the global community, mitigating the factors that lead to unrest and destabilization.

However, this perspective has not been without its critics. Detractors of Obama’s approach have pointed to examples such as Germany's refugee policy, which they argue has led to increased safety concerns and a heightened risk of terrorism. Critics contend that the influx of refugees could compromise the security of host nations, raising questions about the effectiveness of policies that prioritize humanitarian assistance over national safety.

The discourse surrounding Obama’s proposals raises important questions about the balance between individual freedoms and collective security. Skepticism has emerged regarding whether the acceptance of constraints, as advocated by the former president, genuinely serves the interests of American citizens. Some argue that such measures could undermine fundamental American freedoms and sovereignty, leading to a potential erosion of the principles upon which the nation was founded.

As the debate continues, it is clear that the challenge of reconciling liberty with security remains a pressing issue for policymakers. The complexities of international relations, coupled with the realities of global migration and security threats, necessitate a nuanced approach that considers both humanitarian obligations and the safety of citizens.

In conclusion, Obama’s address at the United Nations General Assembly serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle to find equilibrium between the ideals of freedom and the imperatives of security. As nations navigate this delicate balance, the implications of their choices will resonate far beyond their borders, shaping the future of international relations and the safety of citizens worldwide. The discussion surrounding these issues is likely to continue, as the world grapples with the challenges of an increasingly interconnected and uncertain global landscape.",23.0,28.0,576.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03993055555555555,527.0,1.4736842105263157,0.05313092979127135
Real_12-Webpage,Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works,"Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump’s vision.

As he made clear once again in Monday night’s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.”

Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ‘I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “Incomes went up for everybody.”

Story Continued Below

That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “My whole life is about winning. … I always win,” Trump says in explaining why he’s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “Winning the Global Competition.” You don’t get more zero-sum than that.

Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–Trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.

The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.

Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.

No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan’s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.

Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.

Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.

The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders’ powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.

Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. They aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.

We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.

In the landscape of American politics, economic views have become a defining feature of the ongoing discourse, particularly in the context of the 2024 elections. At the forefront of this debate is former President Donald Trump, who has consistently articulated a vision of the economy as a zero-sum game. In Trump's perspective, one party's gain directly correlates to another's loss, framing economic competition as a battleground where winners and losers are clearly delineated. This viewpoint resonates strongly with his supporters, who feel that the current economic climate has left them behind.

Trump's criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been a cornerstone of his economic rhetoric. He argues that the trade deal significantly harmed American manufacturing, leading to substantial job losses across the nation. This narrative taps into the frustrations of many working-class Americans who have witnessed the decline of traditional industries and the erosion of job security. By positioning himself as a champion for American workers, Trump aims to galvanize support from those who feel disenfranchised by globalization and trade policies that they believe prioritize foreign interests over domestic ones.

In stark contrast to Trump’s zero-sum perspective is the economic philosophy espoused by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton advocates for a rising tide that lifts all boats, a sentiment rooted in the successful economic policies implemented during the 1990s under President Bill Clinton. This approach suggests that economic growth can be inclusive, benefiting a broad swath of the population rather than just a select few. Clinton’s emphasis on expanding opportunities aligns with a more optimistic view of the economy, one that seeks to harness innovation and recovery to ensure that everyone can share in the nation’s wealth.

Trump's campaign slogan of ""winning"" encapsulates his competitive stance on the global economy. He frames economic success as a direct result of strategic maneuvering and assertive policies, positioning himself as a leader who will fight for American interests on the world stage. This combative approach appeals to voters who prioritize strength and assertiveness in economic matters, particularly in an era where globalization has reshaped traditional economic landscapes.

However, many economists challenge the notion of a zero-sum economy. They argue that with proper management, economic growth can be achieved in a manner that benefits everyone. This perspective promotes the idea that innovation, investment, and sound policy can create new opportunities, ultimately enhancing the economic well-being of all citizens. The ongoing debate highlights a significant divide among voters, with Trump supporters often embracing the zero-sum mentality while Clinton supporters advocate for policies that expand opportunities for all.

The growing gap between those thriving in the economy and those struggling has become increasingly evident. Recent Census data indicating an increase in median income has been met with skepticism by many. Critics point to the varied individual experiences that paint a more complex picture of economic recovery. While some segments of the population may be enjoying newfound prosperity, others continue to grapple with stagnation and decline. This disparity fuels the polarization between the two camps, exacerbating the divide in how Americans perceive their economic realities.

The voices of those feeling left behind, particularly Trump supporters, have become more pronounced in recent years. Their frustrations echo a historical narrative reminiscent of the Progressive Movement of the 1890s, which also sought to address economic inequality and the struggles of the working class. The resonance of these historical parallels underscores a persistent theme in American politics: the struggle for economic justice and equity.

Interestingly, while Trump may not receive overt financial backing from certain business leaders, he does garner covert support from those who share his worldview. This dynamic illustrates a complex relationship between business interests and political ideologies, where some leaders align with Trump's vision of economic competition, even if they do not publicly endorse him. This undercurrent of support further complicates the economic narrative, as it reveals the multifaceted nature of American capitalism and the diverse opinions within the business community.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the article warns of the potential negative outcomes associated with a zero-sum mentality. Such a perspective can lead to increased division and conflict, stifling collaboration and innovation. In contrast, an open economy that encourages cooperation and growth fosters an environment where new ideas can flourish, benefiting society as a whole. The challenge lies in bridging the divide between these competing ideologies and finding common ground that allows for inclusive economic progress.

In conclusion, the economic debate in American politics is not merely a discussion of numbers and statistics; it is a reflection of deeper societal values and beliefs. As voters prepare to make their voices heard in the upcoming elections, the contrasting visions of Trump and Clinton will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the economy. Whether the nation embraces a zero-sum mentality or opts for a more inclusive approach remains to be seen, but the stakes are undeniably high for all Americans. The path forward will require thoughtful dialogue, innovative solutions, and a commitment to ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared widely, lifting all boats in the process.",72.0,72.0,1571.0,1.3333333333333333,0.04583068109484405,963.0,1.894736842105263,0.07476635514018691
Real_13-Webpage,"President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill, Setting Up Showdown With Congress","President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

“I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message.

“I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”

The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.

Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.

The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.

If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.

Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.

""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.

""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.""

But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.

In a significant political move, President Barack Obama vetoed the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" (JASTA) today, a bill that would have allowed survivors of the September 11 attacks and the families of victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. The veto comes in the wake of Congress’ overwhelming approval of the legislation, which passed unanimously in both the House and Senate, setting the stage for a potential veto override.

During a press conference, President Obama expressed his deep sympathy for the families affected by the 9/11 attacks, acknowledging their ongoing quest for justice. ""I understand the pain and frustration that these families have endured,"" he stated, emphasizing his administration's commitment to supporting their pursuit of accountability. However, he raised concerns that the legislation could undermine the long-standing principle of ""sovereign immunity,"" which protects foreign governments from being sued in U.S. courts. 

By allowing victims of terrorism to pursue legal action against foreign governments, Obama argued that the bill could expose the United States to retaliatory lawsuits from other nations, potentially jeopardizing diplomatic relations. The administration highlighted that the implications of such a law could be far-reaching, particularly in regard to the U.S.’s relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key ally in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has vehemently criticized the legislation, firmly denying any involvement in the 9/11 attacks.

The veto is particularly significant for Obama as he navigates the final months of his presidency. With high approval ratings, a successful veto override would mark a notable political defeat, especially given the bipartisan support the bill received. To successfully override the veto, Congress would need a two-thirds majority in both chambers, a challenging feat given the current political landscape.

In response to the veto, the White House is actively working to rally support among Democrats to block the override. The administration is aware of the political opposition it faces, particularly from many families of 9/11 victims who are seeking legal recourse against those they believe are responsible for the attacks. The emotional weight of the issue is palpable, as these families continue to advocate for justice and accountability.

Adding to the political dynamics, Hillary Clinton, Obama’s former Secretary of State and the Democratic nominee for president, has indicated that she would sign the legislation if elected. This statement adds a layer of complexity to the situation, as it suggests a potential shift in policy direction should there be a change in administration.

As the discussion surrounding JASTA continues, it remains to be seen how Congress will respond to the veto and whether enough support can be garnered to override it. The outcome of this legislative battle will not only affect the families seeking justice but will also have lasting implications for U.S. foreign relations and the legal landscape surrounding terrorism and accountability.

The debate over JASTA encapsulates the difficult balance between seeking justice for victims and maintaining diplomatic ties with foreign nations. As the political ramifications unfold, the voices of 9/11 families will undoubtedly remain at the forefront of this contentious issue, highlighting the ongoing struggle for justice in the wake of one of the most tragic events in American history.",-7.0,3.0,550.0,-0.4375,-0.012727272727272728,601.0,0.15,0.004991680532445923

There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.

The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.

It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474473199000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUv7x5bXV4,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/riot.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice.

North Carolina has become the epicenter of unrest following the shooting of a Black man on a local highway, igniting protests that have drawn both attention and controversy. The demonstrations, which were initially sparked by calls for justice, quickly escalated into violent confrontations, raising questions about the direction of the movement and its impact on the broader cause of racial equality.

Black Lives Matter activists took to the streets in response to the tragic incident, but the protests soon devolved into chaos. Eyewitness accounts and media footage revealed a scene of turmoil as demonstrators engaged in violent actions, including throwing rocks at passing vehicles. This aggressive behavior not only endangered the lives of motorists but also overshadowed the original intent of the protests.

One particularly alarming incident involved a female truck driver who found herself ambushed during the protests. While she was inside her vehicle, her truck was looted, and the cargo was set ablaze. The driver, understandably shaken, called the police for assistance. However, reports indicate that no help arrived in a timely manner, leaving her to endure the frightening ordeal alone. The lack of police response during such a critical moment has raised further concerns about public safety and the effectiveness of law enforcement in managing civil unrest.

As the night wore on, the violence escalated, resulting in injuries to 16 police officers. The freeway, once a vital thoroughfare, was completely shut down, creating a significant disruption not only for the protesters but also for the community at large. The chaotic scenes played out against a backdrop of calls for justice, yet the actions of some demonstrators seemed to contradict the very principles they sought to uphold.

Critics of the protests have been vocal in their condemnation of the violent actions taken by some activists. They argue that such behavior ultimately harms the Black Lives Matter cause, detracting from the message of equality and justice that the movement strives to promote. Instead of fostering understanding and dialogue, the violence has created divisions and fostered a perception of chaos that can hinder progress.

This current wave of protests stands in stark contrast to the civil rights activism led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr., who championed the philosophy of love, integrity, and non-violent resistance. King’s approach emphasized the importance of peaceful protest as a means to achieve social change, advocating for justice through understanding rather than confrontation. The violent actions witnessed in North Carolina raise the question of whether the movement is straying from these foundational principles.

As the situation continues to develop, the community is left grappling with the implications of the protests. While the desire for justice and accountability is undeniably important, the methods employed to express that desire must be carefully considered. The actions taken in the heat of the moment can have lasting effects, not only on the individuals directly involved but also on the broader movement for racial equality.

In the wake of the unrest, it is crucial for activists and community leaders to reflect on the legacy of civil rights activism and the methods that best serve the cause. The path forward may require a recommitment to the principles of non-violence and dialogue, ensuring that the fight for justice remains focused on achieving meaningful change rather than succumbing to chaos and division. As North Carolina grapples with the aftermath of these protests, the hope remains that the spirit of unity and understanding can prevail over violence and discord.",-44.0,-36.0,572.0,-1.6296296296296295,-0.07692307692307693,650.0,-1.44,-0.055384615384615386
Real_15-Webpage,10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.

The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.

Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:

1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.

When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.

Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.”

He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.

2. Personal Attacks Came Early

Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker.

Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics.

“For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.

3. Trading Barbs Over Trade

Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.

“And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said.

Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”

Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.”

“Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said.

Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”

4. Trump Asks ‘Why Not’ Blame All the World’s Problems on Clinton

Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.”

Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?”

Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“

Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""

5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns

Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.

“I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.

Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said.

“I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?

“Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.

6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage

Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.

At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate.

Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015.

“Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”

7. Clinton Defends Being ‘Prepared’ When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail

Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff.

""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.”

Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.

8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion

Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.

“Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said.

Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.”

“They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal.

Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.

9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope

Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.

“I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”

Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.”

The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?""

Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.”

Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”

10. Sparring Over Stamina

Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.”

""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.”

Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.

""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said.

She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:

In a highly anticipated showdown, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump took the stage for their first general election debate at Hofstra University in New York. The event captivated a significant television audience, drawing viewers eager to witness the clash between the two leading candidates for the presidency.

As the debate commenced, the atmosphere was charged with tension, despite a seemingly cordial handshake between the candidates. However, beneath the surface, a layer of sarcasm and pointed jabs was evident throughout the evening. The stage was set for a fierce exchange of ideas and accusations, reflecting the high stakes of the 2016 election.

One of the early points of contention was Trump’s business background. Clinton launched an attack on Trump’s financial history, highlighting that he began his career with a substantial $14 million loan from his father. In response, Trump defended his success, characterizing the loan as a small amount that had grown into a multi-billion dollar enterprise. The exchange underscored the candidates' differing perspectives on economic success and the implications of their respective backgrounds.

The debate soon shifted to the topic of international trade, particularly the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Trump accused Clinton of supporting the TPP, a trade agreement that had faced significant criticism. Clinton, however, asserted that she opposed the TPP once its terms were finalized, attempting to distance herself from the agreement and align her stance with the concerns of many voters.

As the candidates continued to spar, Trump suggested that Clinton would bear the blame for various global issues, a claim that prompted a sarcastic response from Clinton. This back-and-forth exchange highlighted the candidates' contrasting approaches to foreign policy and their attempts to position themselves as the more capable leader.

Another contentious issue was Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns, a topic that has followed him throughout the campaign. Trump insisted that he would make his tax returns public only after Clinton released her deleted emails, a statement that drew skepticism from many observers. This exchange emphasized the ongoing scrutiny both candidates faced regarding transparency and accountability.

The debate also saw the resurfacing of the birther issue, which has long been a point of contention for Trump. After years of questioning President Obama’s citizenship, Trump acknowledged Obama’s legitimacy but controversially attributed the initial inquiry to Clinton’s aides. This moment illustrated the lingering divisions within the electorate and the tactics candidates employ to navigate sensitive topics.

Clinton took the opportunity to defend her preparation for the debate, countering Trump’s criticism of her time away from the campaign trail. Her rebuttal aimed to showcase her readiness for the presidency, contrasting with Trump’s more unconventional approach to campaigning.

One of the more heated discussions of the night revolved around the controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy. Trump defended the policy, claiming it had a significant positive impact on safety in New York City. The debate over this contentious issue highlighted the candidates' differing views on law enforcement and community relations, resonating with voters concerned about crime and policing practices.

In a surprising turn, Trump denied supporting the Iraq War, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. He maintained that he was against the war from the outset, a claim that raised eyebrows among those familiar with his past statements. This denial marked another instance of the candidates challenging each other's narratives and attempting to reshape their public images.

As the debate progressed, Trump questioned Clinton's stamina for the presidency, a jab that Clinton met with a robust defense of her extensive experience in public service. She highlighted her years of political involvement and criticized Trump’s derogatory comments about women, using the moment to emphasize her qualifications and resilience.

The first general election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump proved to be a microcosm of the larger electoral battle, with both candidates employing a mix of strategy, sarcasm, and stark contrasts in their policies and personal histories. As the evening concluded, it was clear that the debate had set the tone for the campaign ahead, with both candidates eager to solidify their positions and sway undecided voters in the weeks to come.",50.0,-14.0,2076.0,0.6024096385542169,0.024084778420038536,793.0,-0.4375,-0.017654476670870115
Real_16-Webpage,Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

“I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

“It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

“Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",http://abcn.ws/2cTj7ap,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"More Michael,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting3_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting1_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting2_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_12x5_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939,"{""fb_title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""description"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@MichaelEHayden"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:03:26"", ""keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter, us news, national news, local news"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter""}","- Peaceful protesters attended Charlotte's first city council meeting since the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 speakers opposing police violence.

Charlotte, NC – The city council meeting held on Tuesday evening became a focal point for community outrage and grief in the wake of the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. Peaceful protesters filled the chambers, with over 50 speakers taking to the microphone to voice their opposition to police violence and the systemic issues affecting the black community in Charlotte.

One of the most poignant moments of the meeting came from a young girl named Zianna Oliphant. Her emotional testimony struck a chord with those in attendance as she highlighted the profound impact of police shootings on children, particularly within the black community. Zianna, visibly shaken, expressed her feelings about the loss of parents and the ongoing suffering that families endure due to violence. She poignantly referenced Scott's seven children, illustrating how the ramifications of such tragedies extend far beyond the immediate victims.

The protests surrounding Scott's shooting began last Tuesday, igniting a wave of demonstrations that escalated throughout the week. While initial gatherings were peaceful, tensions escalated as the situation intensified, culminating in violent confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement. The police response included the use of tear gas and rubber bullets, which further inflamed the situation. Protesters, in turn, reacted with anger, resulting in incidents of throwing objects and looting.

Amidst the turmoil, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum during the city council meeting. However, her plea was met with criticism from protesters who expressed their frustration with both her and Police Chief Kerr Putney. The atmosphere was charged, with many attendees demanding accountability and transparency regarding the events surrounding Scott's death.

Following the meeting, protesters chanted for the release of the full video footage of Scott's shooting. This demand was echoed by Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, who spoke passionately in an interview about the need for complete transparency. ""We deserve to see what happened,"" Dotch stated, emphasizing the community's right to access all relevant information surrounding the incident.

While Chief Putney had previously released partial body and dashboard camera footage, many community members remain unsatisfied with the information provided. The released footage has not clarified whether Scott was armed or posed a threat to the officers involved, leaving many questions unanswered and fueling public outrage.

The city council meeting served as a reminder of the deep-seated pain and frustration felt by many in the Charlotte community. As the protests continue, residents are calling for a more comprehensive examination of police practices and accountability measures to prevent further tragedies.

The emotional testimonies from speakers like Zianna Oliphant underscore the urgent need for dialogue and reform in how law enforcement interacts with the community. As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of Keith Lamont Scott's shooting, the calls for justice and transparency will likely resonate in the city's ongoing discussions about policing and community relations.

As the situation develops, the city of Charlotte stands at a crossroads, facing a pivotal moment that could shape the future of its relationship with its residents. With emotions running high and demands for change mounting, the community's resolve to seek justice and accountability remains steadfast.",-57.0,-52.0,570.0,-2.28,-0.1,590.0,-2.1666666666666665,-0.08813559322033898

Real_18-Webpage,Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night’s big debate: Don’t let Donald Trump get away with it.

And Trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.”

Story Continued Below

The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.”

“The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,” Silver tweeted.

During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.

“We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told “CBS This Morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, “that that simply be checked.”

“The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.

But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump’s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he’s a Democrat and the system is “very unfair.” The “NBC Nightly News” anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.

“I don’t know that he knew what Lester Holt’s voter registration was,” said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. “He didn’t lie,” Conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.”

In a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, Monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn’t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.

But Clinton’s campaign has beat up on Holt’s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. “In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” Janet Brown, the commission’s executive director, told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

For her part, Clinton won’t let Trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn’t, either.

“There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.”

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.

“I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “You can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but I don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.”

Trump’s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp’s preparation for two Trumps.

“We don’t want Donald Trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We’re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” Mook told NBC’s “Today.”

Asked about Clinton’s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that “it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.”

But Conway shot down the notion that there’s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that “Overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and Conway joined the pile-on.

“He’s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,” Conway said. “And that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.”

After Mook warned against “a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” Conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.”

“I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.”

Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.

“I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.

“What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,” Conway said. “Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.”

Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance.

“So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself — and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.

""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""

As the countdown to the highly anticipated presidential debate approaches, tensions are mounting between the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. With the race tightening and recent polls indicating a ""dead heat,"" both candidates are preparing for what could be a pivotal moment in the election. The stakes are high, and both sides are strategizing to ensure their messages resonate with voters.

Hillary Clinton's campaign has taken a firm stance, urging that Donald Trump should not be permitted to mislead the public during the debate. Clinton's team is acutely aware of Trump's propensity for making controversial statements, and they are determined to hold him accountable for any misinformation that may arise during the event. To that end, they have reached out to the debate's moderator, Lester Holt, requesting that he fact-check Trump in real-time. This move underscores the Clinton campaign's commitment to factual accuracy and its desire to prevent any potential misrepresentation of the issues at hand.

In response, Trump's campaign has pushed back against these requests, arguing that the media is inherently biased against their candidate. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, has voiced concerns that the debate conditions are being manipulated by Clinton's team. She insists that the moderator should remain impartial and refrain from intervening in the candidates' exchanges. Conway's remarks highlight the ongoing narrative from Trump's camp that he is often unfairly treated by the media and debate moderators alike.

The debate is shaping up to be a crucial moment for both candidates, particularly as recent polls show Trump gaining ground on Clinton. Analysts have noted that the race is tightening, with some declaring it a ""dead heat."" This shift in the electoral landscape adds an extra layer of pressure for both campaigns as they prepare for the national stage.

Clinton's press secretary has been vocal about the need for accountability during the debate, emphasizing that Trump's frequent lies should not go unchecked. The Clinton campaign is preparing extensively for the possibility of falsehoods being presented by Trump, underscoring their commitment to ensuring that the debate remains grounded in reality. This focus on truth-telling is a key component of their strategy as they look to sway undecided voters and reinforce their base.

On the other side, Trump's campaign is attempting to frame Clinton as overly scripted and lacking authenticity. They argue that while Clinton may present a polished image, it comes at the cost of genuine connection with voters. In contrast, Trump's team is promoting his spontaneous nature, suggesting that his unfiltered approach will resonate more with the electorate. This characterization plays into the broader narrative of the two candidates: Clinton as the establishment politician and Trump as the outsider.

Amid these strategic discussions, concerns have been raised by Conway regarding the potential use of gender dynamics during the debate. She cautioned that Clinton may leverage her gender to sway public perception, suggesting that any perceived unfairness in their interactions could be framed in a way that benefits Clinton. This discourse around gender and its role in the debate highlights the complexities of the electoral landscape, particularly as it pertains to the portrayal of women in politics.

Rudy Giuliani, a key advisor to Trump, has also weighed in on the debate preparations. He has advised Trump to be himself and to avoid trying to compete with Clinton's policy expertise. Instead, Giuliani suggests that Trump should rely on his natural style and authenticity to connect with voters. This advice reflects Trump's broader campaign strategy, which has often emphasized his outsider status and ability to speak directly to the concerns of everyday Americans.

As the debate draws near, both campaigns are bracing for a showdown that could significantly impact the trajectory of the election. With Clinton's team focused on ensuring factual accuracy and holding Trump accountable for misinformation, and Trump's campaign emphasizing authenticity and spontaneity, the stage is set for a contentious exchange. Voters will be watching closely, and the outcome of this debate may very well shape the final weeks of the campaign leading up to Election Day.",-11.0,2.0,2057.0,-0.22,-0.0053475935828877,773.0,0.06451612903225806,0.00258732212160414
Real_19-Webpage,Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?,"I’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I’m pretty much baffled.

The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: “You’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.

Story Continued Below

Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that’s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”)

Further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).

By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump—bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post—but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump—and he's still standing.

Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history.

The Focus Is on “Moments”—But They’re Not Always The Key

Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:

“Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked Americans ‘are you better off?’ Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.”

These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It’s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “You’ve all become theater critics.”)

But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.

The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.

There Are Three Debates, Not One—And That Can Matter A Whole Lot

One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th—barely a week before the election.

Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That’s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.

Here, I think, is an opening for Clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).

Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo

The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.

“Well,” he said, “they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.”

Judo, however, can cut both ways. There’s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.

“Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.”

Debates Are NOT Decisive

One last note. It’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory.

In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.

Of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. So you’ll probably want to tune in anyway

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the anticipation surrounding the debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is palpable. With nearly 40 years of experience analyzing presidential debates, experts express uncertainty regarding the strategies that Clinton might employ against her unpredictable opponent. The dynamics of this election cycle present unique challenges and opportunities for both candidates, particularly in how they leverage their strengths and address vulnerabilities during the debates.

One of the primary challenges facing Clinton is Trump's erratic behavior. His tendency to defy expectations makes it difficult for Clinton to formulate a coherent strategy that plays to her strengths without risking them being turned against her. Trump, known for his ability to pivot and reframe narratives, could easily twist Clinton's extensive experience into a liability, framing it as a contributing factor to the current political turmoil. This potential reframing raises questions about how Clinton can effectively present herself as a qualified candidate while countering Trump's assertions.

The concept of ""political judo"" emerges as a crucial element in this debate landscape. Trump has the opportunity to utilize this technique to undermine Clinton's strengths, turning her experience into a point of contention rather than a badge of honor. This strategic maneuvering could resonate with undecided voters, drawing parallels to Ronald Reagan's approach in 1980, where he successfully gained trust among a skeptical electorate. The ability to connect with these voters will be vital for both candidates as they navigate the complexities of public perception.

Clinton's struggle with the issue of honesty and trustworthiness further complicates her position. Trump's potential to leverage criticisms from credible sources against her could undermine her campaign's message. As debates often hinge on the perception of a candidate's integrity, Clinton must find a way to address these concerns head-on while not allowing Trump to dominate the narrative.

The historical context of presidential debates highlights the significance of memorable moments. Often, a single exchange can overshadow the cumulative effect of the entire debate, leading to a lasting impression on the electorate. This phenomenon underscores the importance of preparation and adaptability during the debates. With multiple debates scheduled, both candidates have the chance to recover from initial missteps, as has been seen in past elections where candidates rebounded from poor performances.

Clinton's potential to connect with voters in town hall formats offers her a unique opportunity to share personal stories that highlight her experience and draw attention to Trump's inconsistencies. This approach could resonate with voters who value authenticity and relatability, allowing Clinton to differentiate herself from Trump in a meaningful way.

However, the debate landscape is not one-sided; both candidates can utilize ""political judo"" against each other. Clinton may find openings to counter Trump's claims of success, particularly if she can effectively communicate how her policies would lead to more sustainable and equitable outcomes. The back-and-forth nature of debates allows for this kind of strategic interplay, where each candidate seeks to gain the upper hand.

While debates are often viewed as pivotal moments in an election cycle, the impact they have on overall election outcomes can be overstated. Fundamental factors such as economic performance and voter sentiment typically play a more significant role in determining the outcome. Nevertheless, the current election cycle suggests a close race, indicating that viewers will likely tune in for the debates, eager to see how the candidates navigate this high-stakes environment.

As the debates draw closer, both Clinton and Trump must prepare not only for the substance of their arguments but also for the unpredictable nature of their opponent's responses. The stakes are high, and the outcome of these debates could significantly influence the trajectory of the election. Each candidate's ability to adapt, connect with voters, and effectively counter their opponent's narratives will be crucial in the coming weeks. 

In conclusion, the 2024 presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are set to be a defining moment in the election cycle. With the challenges posed by Trump's unpredictable behavior and Clinton's need to address concerns about trustworthiness, the debates will likely be a battleground for contrasting visions of the future. The effectiveness of each candidate's strategy, their ability to connect with undecided voters, and their capacity to leverage memorable moments will ultimately shape the narrative leading up to Election Day. As both candidates prepare for this critical phase of the campaign, the eyes of the nation will be watching, eager to see how the debate dynamics unfold.",34.0,54.0,1979.0,0.5151515151515151,0.017180394138453764,840.0,1.6363636363636365,0.06428571428571428

Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.

""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.""

The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.

Her remarks came in the wake of the shooting deaths of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma and Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina, which have reignited discussions surrounding police use of lethal force.

Clinton acknowledged the ongoing debate about these tragic events and emphasized the necessity for heightened awareness. ""There is still much we don't know yet,"" she stated, reflecting on the complexities surrounding the circumstances of these incidents. She noted the addition of two more names to the growing list of African Americans who have lost their lives at the hands of police, underscoring the urgency of addressing these issues.

While Clinton expressed uncertainty about having all the answers, she was clear in her conviction that too many lives have been lost unnecessarily. Her comments resonate with a public increasingly concerned about police violence and systemic racism. In light of the ongoing protests, Clinton urged the public to redirect their anger away from police officers, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of the situation.

The former Secretary of State's statements contribute to the national dialogue on police reform and accountability, as communities across the country grapple with the implications of these recent tragedies.

Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton.

“The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?”

“I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.”

Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race.

“He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”

In a recent statement, Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential candidate, expressed pride in providing voters an alternative to the dominant candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Johnson emphasized that his campaign represents a choice for those seeking a distinct political path, rather than settling for the ""lesser of two evils."" 

Addressing concerns that his candidacy may spoil the election for Clinton, Johnson confidently asserted that his supporters are drawn to him for who he is, rather than as a strategic vote against another candidate. He highlighted a significant trend in voter registration, noting that 50% of new voters are now identifying as independents. This statistic raises questions about the ongoing dominance of the two-party system in American politics and suggests a growing desire for more diverse representation.

While Johnson remains optimistic about his campaign's potential to resonate with voters, Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, has downplayed Johnson's impact on the election landscape. Mook pointed to a recent poll indicating that Johnson's support has dipped to 5%, suggesting that his influence may be waning. He claimed that Johnson is siphoning votes from both major party candidates but expressed skepticism about the ability of third-party candidates to significantly alter the election's outcome.

As the election approaches, the dynamics between third-party candidates and major party contenders continue to evolve. Johnson's campaign aims to attract those disillusioned with the traditional political system, while the major parties remain focused on consolidating their bases in an increasingly polarized environment.",4.0,11.0,300.0,0.5,0.013333333333333334,291.0,1.1,0.037800687285223365

Real_22-Webpage,Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.”

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.”

Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

This week, the Senate reconvened, and Democrats introduced a significant bill aimed at enhancing transparency among presidential candidates. Spearheaded by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the proposed legislation mandates that candidates release their tax returns within 15 days of securing their party’s nomination. This initiative seeks to ensure that voters have access to critical financial information that could influence their electoral decisions.

Under the new proposal, if candidates fail to comply with the tax return disclosure requirement, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would be responsible for releasing the documents after a 30-day grace period. This measure aims to hold candidates accountable and promote transparency in the electoral process, allowing voters to make informed choices based on candidates’ financial histories.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) noted that the Senate will be available for voting next week, indicating a potential timeline for the bill's consideration. The introduction of this legislation comes at a time when transparency in political finance is under increased scrutiny, especially regarding the tax practices of high-profile candidates.

Historically, the release of tax returns has been a contentious issue in American politics. Notably, former presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton disclosed over 30 years of tax returns, setting a precedent for transparency. In contrast, only one candidate since 1976, Gerald Ford, has refused to release such documents. This disparity raises questions about accountability and public trust in candidates.

The 2012 election serves as a pertinent example of the implications of limited tax return disclosures. During that election cycle, Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) criticized Mitt Romney for releasing only two years of tax returns, suggesting that Romney was concealing significant financial information. A week before the election, Bloomberg News reported on Romney's substantial income and lack of tax payments, lending credence to Reid's allegations and further fueling the debate over the necessity of full financial disclosure.

Currently, the discourse surrounding transparency has shifted toward former President Donald Trump. Reid recently characterized Trump as ""ethically compromised,"" dubbing him the ""king of the welfare kings."" This statement underscores the growing concern among lawmakers about Trump's financial dealings and the implications they may have on his leadership and decision-making.

The article emphasizes the importance of transparency regarding Trump’s tax returns, suggesting that such disclosures are essential for voters to make informed decisions in future elections. The ongoing calls for congressional action to impeach Trump further highlight the urgency of addressing these issues and ensuring accountability among those in positions of power.

As the Senate prepares to discuss the proposed bill next week, the outcome could have lasting implications for the future of presidential campaigns and the expectations placed on candidates regarding financial transparency. The push for this legislation reflects a broader desire among lawmakers to restore trust in the electoral process and promote ethical standards among those seeking the highest office in the land.",-9.0,10.0,496.0,-0.6428571428571429,-0.018145161290322582,550.0,0.47619047619047616,0.01818181818181818
Real_23-Webpage,Dem congressman to IRS: Audit the Trump Foundation,"Story highlights Trump reportedly used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes,"" Sander Levin wrote to the IRS

Washington (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen

The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.

The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.

Michigan Democratic Representative Sander Levin has formally requested an audit of The Trump Foundation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This move comes in the wake of a report revealing that former President Donald Trump allegedly utilized $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal disputes.

Levin underscored the importance of ensuring that charitable funds are allocated strictly for charitable purposes, rather than being diverted for personal or business interests. The request for an audit follows findings reported by The Washington Post, which detailed payments made by Trump that raised eyebrows among Democrats. In 2007, Trump reportedly paid a $100,000 settlement to Palm Beach, and in 2011, he settled a lawsuit concerning a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament for $158,000.

These revelations have led to accusations of self-dealing against Trump from Democratic leaders, who argue that such actions undermine the integrity of charitable organizations. 

In a related political response, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has advised Hillary Clinton's campaign to exercise caution in leveraging these allegations as a political weapon.

Real_24-Webpage,Armed Intruders Break in House…Armed Resident Responds – Eagle Rising,"Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun.

The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway.

After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away.

In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.”

Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.”

Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.

“They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.”

Story Continued Below

Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.

“I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.”

“Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.”

Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.

""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.

“I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""

While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.

“I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”

Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.""

“I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”

In the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, former President Donald Trump has voiced strong criticisms of debate moderator Lester Holt, asserting that the questioning was markedly unfair. Trump contended that Holt focused disproportionately on his past controversies while neglecting to address pressing issues surrounding his opponent, Hillary Clinton.

During a post-debate interview, Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with Holt's performance, particularly highlighting what he perceived as a lack of inquiry into Clinton's various scandals. He pointed out that significant topics such as the FBI investigation into Clinton’s email practices and the events surrounding the Benghazi attack were glaring omissions from Holt’s questioning. Trump’s remarks underscored a sentiment that he felt the debate's structure favored Clinton, allowing her to evade scrutiny on critical issues.

Trump elaborated on his experience during the debate, stating that while he believed he handled the standard questions effectively, he was confronted with what he described as ""hostile"" inquiries regarding his past business dealings and lawsuits. This perception of bias led Trump to assign Holt a grade of C+ for his overall performance. He acknowledged that Holt's initial questions were satisfactory but criticized the subsequent focus on Trump's legal history, which he felt detracted from the broader issues at hand.

In a show of solidarity, Trump’s campaign team, including Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence and senior advisor Kellyanne Conway, echoed his sentiments regarding Holt’s moderation. They reinforced the notion that key issues pertaining to Clinton were overlooked, further fueling the narrative of an uneven playing field during the debate.

Adding to the controversy, Trump claimed to have experienced technical difficulties with his microphone during the debate, hinting that the equipment might have been tampered with. He suggested that this malfunction could have impacted his ability to communicate effectively, contributing to the overall perception of his performance.

The debate took a particularly contentious turn when Clinton mentioned Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe contestant. Trump noted that this reference was the moment when he felt provoked, stating that Clinton’s comments about Machado struck a nerve. In defending his past remarks about Machado, Trump characterized her as a challenging individual to manage during her tenure as Miss Universe, suggesting that his comments were reflective of the difficulties he faced rather than an attack on her character.

The exchange over Machado has since become a focal point in discussions surrounding the debate, with Trump’s defense of his comments drawing both criticism and support. His assertion that he was unfairly targeted during the debate has resonated with some of his supporters, who view his treatment as indicative of a broader bias against him in the media and political discourse.

As the campaign continues, Trump’s criticisms of Holt and his reflections on the debate are likely to play a significant role in shaping the narrative leading up to the election. The former president's focus on perceived injustices during the debate may serve to galvanize his base, reinforcing their commitment to his candidacy as they prepare for the upcoming electoral challenges.

In summary, Trump’s post-debate commentary has highlighted a range of issues, from moderator performance to the handling of sensitive topics. As the political landscape evolves, these discussions will undoubtedly influence voter perceptions and the dynamics of the ongoing campaign.",-41.0,-15.0,1119.0,-1.025,-0.03663985701519214,628.0,-0.7142857142857143,-0.02388535031847134

In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.

Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.

From the Daily Mail:

National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.

A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.

On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street.

After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.

A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has descended into chaos for the second consecutive night as violent protests erupt in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an armed black suspect. The unrest has prompted Governor Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency as the situation escalates and law enforcement struggles to maintain order.

The protests, which began peacefully, quickly turned violent, leading to a series of confrontations between demonstrators and police. Tragically, one protester was critically wounded after being shot in the head by another protester and is currently on life support. In addition to this serious injury, three other protesters and four police officers sustained injuries during the riots, highlighting the dangerous atmosphere that has enveloped the city.

In an effort to restore order, National Guard troops have been deployed to assist local law enforcement in controlling the escalating violence. The presence of the National Guard aims to provide additional resources and personnel to help quell the unrest that has gripped Charlotte.

The protests have not only resulted in injuries but have also led to significant property damage. Vandalism and looting have affected numerous businesses, including high-profile establishments like the NASCAR Hall of Fame and other major companies in downtown Charlotte. The financial impact of these actions is likely to be felt long after the protests have ended.

Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering implementing a curfew as a means to manage the unrest and protect both citizens and property. The potential curfew reflects the urgency of the situation and the need for decisive action to curb the violence that has marred the city.

While some demonstrators have voiced their frustrations regarding the lawlessness and the actions of their fellow protesters, others have engaged in violent confrontations with police. This division among the protesters has complicated the response efforts and raised concerns about the overall message of the demonstrations.

The media has also found itself in the crossfire of the unrest, with reports of attacks on journalists covering the events. A CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast, illustrating the dangers faced by those attempting to report on the rapidly evolving situation in Charlotte.

As the protests continue, demonstrators have taken to vandalizing buildings with messages such as ""Black Lives Matter,"" while also breaking into stores. These actions have sparked further debate about the effectiveness and direction of the protests, raising questions about how to achieve meaningful change without resorting to violence.

In response to the escalating tensions, police have employed various crowd control measures, including the use of flash grenades and tear gas, to disperse crowds that have been throwing objects at them. The confrontations between police and protesters have resulted in a tense standoff, with both sides facing significant challenges in navigating the situation.

As Charlotte grapples with the fallout from the police shooting and the subsequent protests, the community remains divided. The events of the past few nights have reignited discussions about race, policing, and the need for reform, with many calling for a more peaceful approach to addressing grievances.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by communities across the nation in the wake of police-related incidents. As the city braces for another night of potential unrest, the hope remains that dialogue and understanding can ultimately pave the way for healing and progress.

The eyes of the nation are on Charlotte as it confronts the challenges of the moment. With the deployment of the National Guard and the potential for a curfew, officials are working diligently to restore peace and safety to a city in turmoil. The coming days will be crucial in determining the path forward for both the community and the broader conversation surrounding police violence and social justice.",-82.0,-41.0,674.0,-2.484848484848485,-0.12166172106824925,693.0,-1.5185185185185186,-0.05916305916305916

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked Rouhani whether he'd rather work with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. Rouhani said, ""Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.

Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.

Real_28-Webpage,“How Can we LEAD When we Can’t Even Control Our Own Cities?” [VIDEO] – Eagle Rising,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said:

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.

“Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.

“Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?

“We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.

“Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.

“The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.

“There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.

“Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.”

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – In a recent address, former President Donald Trump spoke candidly about the national unrest following several officer-involved shootings, emphasizing the urgent need for unity and togetherness in America during these challenging times. His remarks came as protests and demonstrations have erupted across the country, prompting a national conversation about law enforcement and community relations.

During his speech, Trump underscored the importance of respecting the American flag and the shared values that bind citizens together. He urged Americans to foster understanding and empathy, encouraging individuals to ""walk a mile in someone else’s shoes."" This call for compassion was framed as essential for navigating the complexities of the current social climate.

The former president did not shy away from criticizing the ongoing unrest, arguing that it presents a poor image of the United States as a global leader. He acknowledged the right to peaceful protest but condemned the violent disruptions that have threatened public safety. Trump emphasized that while citizens are entitled to express their grievances, such expressions should not come at the cost of community safety and order.

In his address, Trump asserted that all Americans deserve to live in secure communities, calling for an end to violence against both citizens and law enforcement. He highlighted that law-abiding African-American residents in the communities affected by riots are often the ones who suffer the most. By drawing attention to the impact of violence on these families, Trump aimed to frame the conversation around the need for safety and stability in neighborhoods across the nation.

Trump reiterated that the government's primary duty is to ensure the wellbeing and safety of its citizens. He rejected the notion of tolerating lawless conduct, framing crime and violence as direct attacks on the poor and vulnerable. His comments resonated with a segment of the population that feels increasingly concerned about public safety amid rising tensions.

The former president's focus on supporting law-abiding citizens, particularly African-American families seeking safe environments for their children, was a central theme of his speech. He called for a collective effort to create communities where everyone can thrive without fear of violence or unrest.

As Trump continues to engage with the public on these pressing issues, his message of unity and safety resonates with those who are eager for solutions to the challenges facing the nation. The call for empathy and understanding, paired with a firm stance against violence, reflects a desire for a more cohesive society where all individuals can feel secure.

In conclusion, Trump's address in Pittsburgh serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding national unrest and the need for dialogue that prioritizes safety, respect, and shared values. As America grapples with these issues, the former president's emphasis on unity may play a pivotal role in shaping the conversation moving forward.",-5.0,-18.0,540.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.009259259259259259,529.0,-0.9,-0.034026465028355386
Real_29-Webpage,9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him,"""Donald, you’re a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him

Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.

That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father.

Story Continued Below

1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection

In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.”

“The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’”

2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward”

Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.”

“It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said.

3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully”

“Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said . “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.”

4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women”

Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.”

5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky”

In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.”

6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth”

Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.”

7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said

“I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said .

8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer”

Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’

And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.”

9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family

“I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.

Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.

In a surprising turn of events, Senator Ted Cruz has officially endorsed Donald Trump, a mere two months after facing a chorus of boos at the Republican National Convention for his refusal to back the former president. The endorsement marks a significant shift for Cruz, who has spent much of the past year publicly criticizing Trump, particularly regarding personal attacks that have targeted his family.

Cruz's endorsement comes on the heels of a tumultuous relationship with Trump, characterized by a series of sharp insults and pointed remarks. The senator's animosity toward Trump peaked when the latter launched personal attacks against Cruz’s wife, Heidi, and suggested dubious connections between Cruz’s father and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. These incidents prompted Cruz to respond vehemently, declaring that personal attacks on family members were unacceptable and demonstrating a level of indignation that resonated with many of his supporters.

In February, Cruz went so far as to speculate that Trump’s tax returns might reveal nefarious connections to organized crime, insinuating that the former president was hiding something significant. This accusation was part of a broader narrative Cruz constructed around Trump’s character, which he has described in increasingly harsh terms. By March, Cruz had escalated his rhetoric, labeling Trump a ""sniveling coward"" for his threats against Cruz’s wife, further emphasizing the importance of family in political discourse.

Cruz did not stop there; he characterized Trump as a “big, loud New York bully,” criticizing him for his propensity to attack the spouses and children of his political opponents. Cruz’s disdain for Trump’s behavior was compounded by his assertion that Trump is “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women,” framing the former president’s actions as not only aggressive but also indicative of deeper insecurities.

In May, Cruz’s criticisms reached a fever pitch when he dismissed Trump’s bizarre claims regarding his father’s alleged involvement in JFK's assassination as “nuts” and “kooky.” This comment reflected Cruz’s growing frustration with Trump’s tendency to make unfounded allegations, which Cruz argued undermined the integrity of political discourse. He further accused Trump of being a ""pathological liar,"" claiming that Trump consistently lies and projects his own dishonesty onto others, a sentiment that resonated with many within the Republican base who value integrity and honesty in their leaders.

Cruz elaborated on this theme, asserting that Trump is “utterly amoral,” suggesting that the former president could pass a lie detector test while making contradictory statements. This assertion painted a picture of Trump as someone who is not only dishonest but also devoid of moral principles, further alienating Cruz from the Trump camp.

Additionally, Cruz did not shy away from addressing Trump’s personal life, labeling him a narcissist and a “serial philanderer.” He emphasized Trump’s pride in his infidelity, a characteristic that Cruz argued was unbecoming of a leader. This critique was particularly striking given the traditional values often espoused by Cruz and his supporters, which place a premium on family integrity and moral character.

Despite these scathing remarks, Cruz’s endorsement of Trump signifies a complex and perhaps contradictory stance. As of July, Cruz had publicly stated his unwillingness to support Trump, citing the former president's attacks on his family as a primary reason for his hesitance. Cruz made it clear that he could not support someone who slanders his wife or father, a position that seemed firm at the time.

However, the political landscape is ever-changing, and Cruz’s eventual endorsement raises questions about the motivations behind such a shift. Is it a strategic maneuver to align with the party’s frontrunner, or has Cruz genuinely reconciled his differences with Trump? The endorsement could be seen as a pragmatic decision in the face of Trump’s continued dominance within the Republican Party, demonstrating a willingness to set aside personal grievances for the sake of political unity.

Cruz’s endorsement may also reflect a broader trend among Republican leaders who have navigated the tumultuous waters of Trump’s influence over the party. Many have found themselves in a position where they must choose between their principles and the political power that comes with aligning with Trump. For Cruz, the decision to endorse Trump may signal an acceptance of the reality that to remain relevant in the party, he must align himself with its most influential figure, despite his previous criticisms.

Ultimately, Ted Cruz’s journey from a vocal critic to an endorser of Donald Trump encapsulates the complexities of modern American politics. It highlights the challenges faced by politicians who must balance personal beliefs with party loyalty, particularly in an era dominated by a figure like Trump, whose influence continues to shape the Republican landscape. As the political climate evolves, Cruz’s endorsement may serve as a litmus test for other Republican leaders grappling with similar dilemmas, raising critical questions about the future direction of the party and the values it chooses to uphold. 

As the 2024 election cycle approaches, all eyes will be on Cruz and how he navigates his relationship with Trump and the broader Republican base, which remains divided over the former president’s legacy and future.",-40.0,-24.0,974.0,-1.2903225806451613,-0.04106776180698152,1007.0,-0.8275862068965517,-0.023833167825223437

These counties could play an outsize role in the election and offer an instructive example of what the political parties have accomplished. Wake County is the fourth county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties.

Washington (CNN)

Few counties could prove more decisive in this election than Wake County, North Carolina.

A historically competitive county whose fortunes are on the rise, Wake could help deliver Hillary Clinton a win in a key battleground state -- or dash her hopes for the presidency. Simply put, if Clinton performs well in the highly educated research triangle, then election night bodes well for her. If Wake County doesn't come out for Clinton, Donald Trump's path to the White House would grow much clearer.

The county is rapidly expanding, and the influx of new people and industries could reshape the race. Meanwhile, the turmoil across the state in Charlotte after a police officer shot and killed a black man could add another focal point in the election — search data from Google Trends shows Wake County's spiking interest in ""police brutality"" this week.

Keep your eye on Wake County, and take a look at the fundamentals below.

Population

Wake County is fairly representative of the country in terms of race and ethnicity, but it has a more highly educated population, bigger incomes and a better job picture than the rest of the nation.

This demographic shift may play a critical role in the upcoming election, as the county's diverse racial and ethnic representation, coupled with higher education levels and incomes, sets it apart from national averages.

Moreover, recent events in nearby Charlotte, particularly surrounding police violence, have sparked heightened local interest in social issues such as police brutality. This surge in civic engagement is reflected in Google Trends data, indicating that residents are increasingly focused on these pressing matters as they head to the polls.

As Wake County continues to evolve, its impact on the 2016 election remains a focal point for analysts and voters alike, making it a county to watch in the coming weeks.",14.0,11.0,293.0,1.0769230769230769,0.04778156996587031,300.0,1.1,0.03666666666666667

President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

“What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.”

“That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.

The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.

“Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”

In a notable moment at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, President Obama broke an unofficial rule against presidential headgear by donning a traditional hat gifted to him by Native American leaders. The event, which highlighted the importance of tribal sovereignty and the contributions of Native American communities, saw Obama receiving both a hat and a blanket as symbols of respect and friendship.

During the conference, Obama wore the blanket around his shoulders while a song was performed in his honor. However, he opted to remove the hat shortly thereafter, mindful of the longstanding tradition that discourages presidents from wearing unusual headgear. This unspoken rule is often associated with former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis's infamous tank helmet incident, which has become a cautionary tale in political circles.

Expressing his gratitude for the thoughtful gifts, Obama humorously remarked about the blanket, suggesting it would serve as a protective measure for his wife, Michelle, to prevent her from claiming it for herself. The moment underscored the deepening relationships he has fostered over his presidency, particularly with Native American leaders and communities.

Reflecting on the significance of the event, Obama noted the importance of the friendships developed throughout his time in office, emphasizing the collaborative spirit that defines the relationship between the federal government and tribal nations. This gathering not only celebrated cultural heritage but also reinforced the ongoing dialogue about the challenges and opportunities facing Native American communities today.

As the conference concluded, the President's departure from protocol served as a reminder of the evolving nature of presidential traditions and the importance of honoring diverse cultural practices within the fabric of American society.",17.0,23.0,327.0,1.4166666666666667,0.05198776758409786,312.0,2.3,0.07371794871794872

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.

“Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.”

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.”

“We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.

Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”

But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.

“I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.

As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

In a recent interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the profound implications of the upcoming election, asserting that it will shape the course of America for the next 50 years. Her remarks come as the nation gears up for a pivotal electoral showdown, with just 50 days remaining until voters head to the polls.

Clinton's emphasis on the long-term consequences of the election was clear as she urged black voters to actively participate in the electoral process. ""The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years,"" she declared, underscoring the critical nature of voter engagement in shaping future policies and societal norms.

In her passionate appeal, Clinton encouraged listeners to check their voter registration status, highlighting the importance of being prepared to vote. ""I need your participation,"" she implored, reinforcing the idea that every vote counts in this consequential election.

Clinton's call to action follows a similar appeal from former President Barack Obama, who has also been vocal about the importance of voter turnout. Obama pointed out that numerous pressing societal issues are at stake in this election, further emphasizing the need for citizens to make their voices heard.

As the political landscape heats up, Clinton is preparing for the first presidential debate against her opponent, Donald Trump, scheduled to take place on Monday in New York. Anticipating a challenging encounter, Clinton acknowledged that she expects to face aggressive attacks from Trump during the debate. However, she remains resolute in her approach, stating, ""I plan to communicate clearly and fearlessly.""

The former Secretary of State did not shy away from condemning Trump's previous remarks, which she characterized as insulting to various groups, including African-Americans, immigrants, and women. Clinton described these insults as intolerable, highlighting her commitment to advocating for inclusivity and respect in political discourse.

As the interview concluded, the political rivalry intensified, with Trump taking to Twitter to mock Clinton. He suggested that she was ""taking the day off"" before the debate, a comment that further escalates the tension leading up to their face-off.

Clinton's interview serves as a reminder of the stakes involved in the upcoming election and the critical role that voter engagement plays in shaping the nation’s future. With both candidates gearing up for a fierce debate, the focus remains on mobilizing voters and ensuring that their voices are heard in the electoral process. 

As the countdown to the election continues, Clinton's urgent message to the electorate is clear: the time to act is now, and the future of America hangs in the balance.",7.0,7.0,524.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013358778625954198,505.0,0.3888888888888889,0.013861386138613862

So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.

Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.

Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as “another Hitler.” She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.

In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.

That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.

It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin’s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did—an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing Russians,” a doubly illegal act of war.

Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.

***

John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, “Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.” Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.

But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.” Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.”

Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.

“Our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.”

He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. “All this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.”

John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.

The legacy of JFK & RFK is “being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party.”

Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.

Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.

Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.

Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime “existential” threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be “existential” enemy.

There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.

Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.”

Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.

But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.

For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.

And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.

***

So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.

We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.

President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future.

Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.

But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.

Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.

Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “There can be no business as usual with Russia.”

Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.

And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:

Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.

Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.

Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.

This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.

Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.

Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.

Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

In a surprising turn of events, a lifelong Democrat and former aide to the legendary Kennedy brothers, John and Robert, has publicly announced his decision to support Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. This decision, rooted in a profound disillusionment with the current trajectory of the Democratic Party, highlights a growing rift between traditional Democratic values and contemporary political realities.

The author reflects on the profound commitment to peace that characterized the Kennedy administration, a time when the Democratic Party stood firmly against unnecessary military intervention. He expresses deep concern that today's Democratic Party has strayed far from these ideals, evolving into what he describes as a ""Party of War."" This transformation is marked by a troubling embrace of military interventions and an aggressive arms trade, fundamentally at odds with the principles that once defined the party.

In his critique of the current Democratic leadership, the author specifically targets Hillary Clinton, whose tenure as Secretary of State was marked by a series of military actions, including invasions and regime changes that have had lasting repercussions on global stability. He takes issue with her negative portrayal of Russia, suggesting that it has contributed to a dangerous atmosphere of hostility and misunderstanding. The author argues that such a stance not only undermines the potential for diplomatic relations but also exacerbates the risk of conflict.

In stark contrast to Clinton's approach, the author posits that Donald Trump is the only candidate advocating for dialogue with Russia. He emphasizes Trump's willingness to explore a collaborative approach to combating terrorism, suggesting that this could pave the way for a more peaceful international landscape. While acknowledging Trump's imperfections, the author praises his political courage in opposing the war hawks within both parties and challenging the prevailing narratives perpetuated by mainstream media.

As he reflects on the legacy of the Kennedys, the author warns that the ideals of peace and diplomacy that they championed are being abandoned by the current Democratic leadership. He laments the ongoing wars and the exorbitant military spending that divert crucial resources away from pressing domestic issues, such as crime and poverty. This misallocation of funds, he argues, is detrimental not only to the well-being of American citizens but also to the nation's moral standing in the world.

The author advocates for a radical shift in priorities, calling for an end to unnecessary military conflicts and a reallocation of resources to address the urgent challenges facing American society. He urges a return to a foreign policy that prioritizes American interests while fostering cooperation with global powers like Russia and China. Such cooperation, he argues, is essential for effectively combating terrorism and ensuring a more secure future.

In a passionate plea, the author calls on citizens to raise their voices against the current administration's militaristic policies. He emphasizes the need to embrace the wisdom of America's founding principles, which champion diplomacy over warfare and cooperation over conflict. In his view, the path forward requires a collective effort to reclaim the values that once defined the nation.

Ultimately, the author concludes that supporting Donald Trump represents a viable path toward peace. He argues that this choice prioritizes the needs of American citizens over foreign military engagements, aligning more closely with the principles of the Kennedys than the current Democratic leadership ever could. In an era marked by division and discord, this endorsement serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring legacy of peace that continues to resonate with many Americans. 

As the election approaches, the author urges voters to reflect on their own values and the direction they wish to see the country take. He believes that by embracing a more peaceful and cooperative approach to foreign relations, the nation can reclaim its moral compass and ensure a brighter future for all its citizens.",-120.0,15.0,3840.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.03125,712.0,0.6,0.021067415730337078

As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.

Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.

From the Independent Review Journal:

But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:

People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474655224000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer4.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer1.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer2.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer3.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer5.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters."", ""title"": ""NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte - But It Wasn't To Protest The National Anthem... | John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 750, ""identifier"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg"", ""height"": 563}, ""url"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""always"", ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 1631890973779575, ""pages"": 389658314427637}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Black Lives Matter"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-23T14:27:04-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/terresamonroe""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- NC State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters, contrasting with the protests against police by figures like Colin Kaepernick.

In a striking display of faith and unity, North Carolina State Troopers in Charlotte took a knee to pray before confronting protesters, a moment that sharply contrasts with the recent protests against police actions led by figures such as Colin Kaepernick. This poignant act of devotion has garnered significant attention, particularly as a photo of the troopers praying went viral, shared widely by the North Carolina Troopers Association. The image underscores a commitment to faith that the troopers believe is essential in turbulent times.

The backdrop for this moment of prayer was the unrest that followed the officer-involved shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. The incident sparked protests across the city, and while some radicals were bused into Charlotte with the intent of inciting violence, the prayerful response from law enforcement played a crucial role in maintaining the peace. As tensions ran high, the emphasis on prayer and reflection helped to diffuse potentially explosive situations and foster a more serene atmosphere.

The viral photo of the troopers kneeling in prayer not only highlights their spiritual commitment but also carries a broader message of unity through faith. Alongside this image, a call for thoughts and prayers resonated across social media, as the troopers expressed their dedication to protecting the community and aiding in its recovery. This message of hope and solidarity transcended the chaos, inviting people from various backgrounds to join in prayer, illustrating that faith knows no racial boundaries.

The presence of the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team in Charlotte during this tumultuous period further reinforced the positive impact of faith-based initiatives. Their involvement offered support and comfort to those affected by the unrest, demonstrating how spiritual outreach can contribute to healing in times of crisis. The team's commitment to serving the community highlighted the power of prayer as a unifying force, especially in a city grappling with division.

As the situation unfolded, many across the country engaged in prayer, echoing the sentiment that faith can bridge divides and bring people together in solidarity. This collective act of devotion served as a reminder that, even amidst unrest, there is the potential for healing and reconciliation through shared beliefs.

The article expresses a sense of pride in the police officers who chose to prioritize prayer and faith over violence. Their decision to kneel in prayer stands in stark contrast to groups like Black Lives Matter, which have often been criticized for promoting division rather than fostering unity. By choosing to respond with prayer, the troopers exemplified a commitment to peace and understanding, reinforcing the idea that faith can play a transformative role in addressing societal issues.

In a time when tensions between law enforcement and communities are at an all-time high, the actions of the NC State Troopers serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of faith and unity. Their willingness to kneel in prayer before engaging with protesters not only reflects their dedication to their duties but also emphasizes the potential for healing through shared values. As Charlotte continues to navigate the aftermath of the unrest, the hope remains that the spirit of unity and faith can lead to a more harmonious future for all.",3.0,48.0,580.0,0.1,0.005172413793103448,584.0,2.4,0.0821917808219178

Real_35-Webpage,Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games.

Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.

Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.

""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.

While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.

During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!""

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

Nonetheless, Rapinoe has no plans of quitting her protest and is willing to risk suspension in order to make a statement.

U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe may be facing disciplinary action from U.S. Soccer after she knelt during the national anthem prior to a match against the Netherlands on September 18. This act of protest was intended to draw attention to perceived injustices and oppression within the United States, aligning her stance with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who famously initiated a similar protest against police brutality and racial prejudice.

In an official release, U.S. Soccer has reiterated its expectation that players and coaches stand during the national anthem. The organization expressed disapproval of Rapinoe's actions, stating that they contradict the values and expectations upheld by U.S. Soccer. While Rapinoe has not yet faced immediate punishment, the organization indicated that her actions will be re-evaluated if she continues to kneel throughout the current season.

During the match, Rapinoe's protest did not go unnoticed by fans; she encountered backlash from the crowd, with one fan vocally urging her to ""Stand up!"" Despite this criticism, Rapinoe remains steadfast in her commitment to her cause. She has made it clear that she is willing to risk suspension in order to continue her protest, emphasizing her dedication to using her platform to advocate for social justice issues.

Rapinoe's decision to kneel has sparked conversations about the intersection of sports and activism, particularly within the realm of women's soccer. As a prominent figure in the sport, her actions have the potential to influence both fans and fellow athletes regarding the importance of speaking out against societal injustices.

In a statement following the match, Rapinoe reinforced her resolve, stating that she intends to continue her protest as a means of solidarity with those who face injustice. She has expressed a desire to be an ally in the fight for social justice, underscoring the responsibility of athletes to leverage their visibility for meaningful change.

As the season progresses, all eyes will be on Rapinoe and U.S. Soccer to see how this situation unfolds. The potential disciplinary action serves as a reminder of the ongoing tensions between personal beliefs and organizational expectations in the world of professional sports. Rapinoe's actions have undoubtedly ignited a dialogue about the role of athletes in advocating for social change, a conversation that is likely to continue as the season unfolds.",0.0,6.0,421.0,0.0,0.0,432.0,0.4,0.013888888888888888

It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed.

Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing.

Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.

Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.”

Below is the offending post:

“I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??”

After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.

Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people.

Brody Jenner, the son of Caitlyn Jenner and Linda Thompson, has ignited a firestorm of controversy following a recent statement he made on Twitter regarding police shootings. In his post, Jenner asserted that not every incident involving law enforcement should be viewed through the lens of race, and he included the phrase ""All Lives Matter,"" a statement that has been met with significant backlash in the current social climate.

Jenner's comments have drawn sharp criticism from liberal circles, where his identity as a white, straight, cis-gender male has been highlighted as a factor in the disdain directed toward his views. Critics argue that his perspective overlooks the systemic issues of racism and inequality that are often at the heart of discussions about police violence and community relations.

In his defense, Jenner expressed frustration with how the media has portrayed his comments and emphasized the importance of complying with police instructions, regardless of an individual's race. He posed a rhetorical question regarding the logic of exiting a vehicle while armed, suggesting that individuals should make it clear if they do not possess a weapon. This line of reasoning has further fueled the outrage among those who feel his comments minimize the complexities of race relations and police interactions.

As the backlash intensified, Jenner took to Instagram to share additional thoughts, which many critics interpreted as an unwillingness to engage meaningfully with the concerns raised by his detractors. His continued social media presence has only served to aggravate those who feel that his statements dismiss the lived experiences of marginalized communities.

The situation has sparked a broader discussion about the nature of public discourse surrounding sensitive issues such as race, policing, and social justice. Observers note that liberals, in particular, are often quick to take offense at statements perceived as tone-deaf or dismissive of systemic inequalities. This incident with Jenner highlights the challenges of navigating conversations about race and policing in a polarized environment, where differing perspectives can lead to significant backlash.

As Jenner's comments continue to circulate online, the discourse surrounding police shootings and race remains a contentious topic. The reactions to his statements reflect a larger societal struggle to reconcile differing viewpoints on these critical issues. Whether Jenner will choose to further engage with his critics or reconsider his stance remains to be seen, but the conversation sparked by his comments is likely to persist in the public sphere. 

In an era where social media amplifies voices both for and against controversial statements, Brody Jenner's remarks serve as a reminder of the complexities involved in discussions about race, law enforcement, and societal expectations.",-17.0,-23.0,476.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.03571428571428571,493.0,-1.4375,-0.04665314401622718

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.”

Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past.

Story Continued Below

“Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.”

The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].”

Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.”

“I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”

In a poignant critique of former President Donald Trump, Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, has expressed her dismay over Trump's refusal to apologize for his involvement in the ""birther"" movement, which questioned the citizenship of former President Barack Obama. Brazile characterized Trump's actions as a ""wound that won't heal,"" drawing attention to the deep-seated racial issues that continue to affect American society.

Brazile's comments come in the wake of recent discussions surrounding the birther controversy, a narrative that Trump perpetuated during his political ascent. She articulated the emotional scars left by such rhetoric, stating that it is a painful reminder of the nation's troubled racial history. Her remarks were further underscored by her personal experiences, particularly her visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, where she reflected on her family's history of slavery and the ongoing struggle for documentation that has persisted through generations.

During her visit to the museum, Brazile was struck by the significance of documentation in understanding one’s identity and history. She highlighted the challenges faced by her ancestors, who lacked the necessary papers to validate their existence and contributions to society. In this context, she urged Trump to consider the importance of producing documentation, a process that for many African Americans is fraught with historical pain and systemic barriers.

The issue was reignited during a recent presidential debate when Trump deflected responsibility for the birther movement, shifting blame onto Hillary Clinton while simultaneously taking credit for pressuring Obama into releasing his birth certificate. This deflection did not sit well with Brazile, who expressed her disappointment in Trump’s lack of accountability. She remarked that an apology from him seems unlikely, further criticizing his tendency to exploit racial pain for political gain.

Brazile's statements resonate with a broader conversation about the ongoing emotional impact of the birther claims and the necessity of addressing the underlying racial issues that continue to plague the nation. She emphasized that the scars of the past are not easily forgotten, and the need for healing is critical. The birther movement, she argued, is not merely a political issue but a reflection of deeper societal wounds that require acknowledgment and understanding.

As Brazile continues to advocate for a more honest dialogue about race in America, her call for reflection serves as a reminder of the importance of recognizing the historical context of racial issues. The implications of the birther controversy extend beyond political rhetoric; they touch on the very fabric of American identity and the ongoing struggle for equality and recognition.

In a time when discussions around race and identity are more crucial than ever, Brazile's critique of Trump highlights the need for leaders to confront uncomfortable truths about the nation's past. By urging Trump to reflect on his actions and their impact, she is not only advocating for accountability but also for a collective healing process that acknowledges the pain of history while striving for a more inclusive future. 

As the nation grapples with its complex racial dynamics, the dialogue initiated by Brazile serves as a vital step toward understanding and addressing the wounds that have yet to heal.",-17.0,-31.0,540.0,-1.0,-0.03148148148148148,604.0,-1.631578947368421,-0.05132450331125828
Real_38-Webpage,US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike,"(CNN) The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.

Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials.

That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.

Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.

But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

“This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.”

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

“If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.”

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

“That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.”

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

In a bold opening to the Emmy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel took the opportunity to address the political climate in the United States, delivering sharp jabs at former President Donald Trump and his supporters. Kimmel's remarks came before a large audience, setting the tone for the evening with humor interwoven with social commentary.

Kimmel began the ceremony by poking fun at Hollywood's elite, emphasizing the remarkable diversity among this year's nominees. He highlighted the strides the industry has made in representation, quipping that the Emmys are so diverse that the Oscars now consider them friends. His playful sarcasm underscored the significance of inclusivity in entertainment, a theme that resonated throughout the night.

The host didn’t shy away from making pointed comments about Trump, suggesting that the former president's political aspirations would not exist without the influence of television. Kimmel humorously posited that if it weren't for the screen, Trump would likely be at home with his wife rather than campaigning for the highest office in the land.

Kimmel took a more direct aim at Mark Burnett, the creator of ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" whom he held responsible for Trump's rise to prominence. He remarked that reality television has become obsolete, as life itself has transformed into a reality show. This critique of modern media's impact on politics struck a chord, as Kimmel underscored the blurred lines between entertainment and governance.

In a particularly humorous twist, Kimmel suggested that if Trump were to gain enough support to build a wall, Burnett should be the first to be tossed over it. This tongue-in-cheek remark not only elicited laughter from the audience but also served as a metaphor for the perceived absurdity of the political landscape shaped by reality television.

Kimmel's opening monologue at the Emmys was a blend of humor and critique, reflecting the current state of American politics while celebrating the progress made in Hollywood. His ability to weave social commentary into comedy highlighted the ongoing dialogue about representation and the influence of media on public perception and political reality. The evening promised not just entertainment but a platform for addressing serious issues facing society today.",13.0,35.0,391.0,0.7222222222222222,0.03324808184143223,411.0,2.3333333333333335,0.0851581508515815

Real_41-Webpage,Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business',"During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump’s debate performance Monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.""

Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""

""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'You’re fired.' They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.""

During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way.""

""When you’re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump.

The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart.""

""He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.

""If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord,"" Biden said about the debate. ""What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.""",http://abcn.ws/2d3YEVr,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"Abc News,More Arlette",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382,"{""fb_title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""description"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@arlettesaenz"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:43:23"", ""keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate""}","- Vice President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's debate performance in Philadelphia, focusing on Trump's comments regarding the housing crisis.

In a recent statement, Vice President Joe Biden took aim at former President Donald Trump's performance during a debate held in Philadelphia, focusing particularly on Trump's remarks concerning the housing crisis. Biden expressed disbelief at Trump’s assertion that it was beneficial for business to witness the housing market fail, a statement that he found deeply troubling.

Biden contrasted Trump’s comments with the actions and values of past presidents, emphasizing that they possessed a moral center and an understanding of fundamental rights. He raised a provocative question about whether Ronald Reagan, a figure often revered in conservative circles, would ever suggest that exploiting the suffering of others could be considered good business practice.

The Vice President further criticized Trump for lacking the fundamental sensibilities and values that he believes are typically held by American politicians. This lack of empathy, according to Biden, is indicative of a broader issue in Trump's approach to leadership and governance.

During the debate, Hillary Clinton accused Trump of essentially rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which Trump responded that such a stance was simply ""called business."" This exchange underscored the stark differences in values between the two candidates, with Biden firmly aligning himself with the notion that such sentiments are not only callous but also detrimental to the American populace.

Biden did not shy away from addressing Trump's privileged lifestyle, questioning how someone so removed from the struggles of everyday Americans could genuinely care about their well-being. He highlighted Trump’s controversial remark about not paying taxes, which Trump characterized as a sign of intelligence. Biden condemned this perspective, arguing that it reflects a lack of understanding and concern for the burden that regular taxpayers carry.

Expressing his anger over Trump's views, Biden pointed out the implications these attitudes have for the American people. He believes that such cynicism towards the electorate is not only irresponsible but also indicative of a deeper disconnect between Trump and the realities faced by many citizens.

In conclusion, Biden made it clear that the upcoming election presents a stark choice for voters. He criticized Trump's apparent cynicism and urged Americans to consider the values and principles that should guide their leaders. As the campaign progresses, Biden's remarks serve as a rallying cry for those who prioritize empathy and responsibility in governance. The Vice President's critique of Trump's debate performance underscores his commitment to advocating for the interests of everyday people, contrasting sharply with what he perceives as Trump's self-serving mentality.",-5.0,-31.0,453.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.011037527593818985,482.0,-1.8235294117647058,-0.06431535269709543
Real_42-Webpage,National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6,"Story highlights Hillary Clinton has a 6-point lead over Donald Trump in a four way race, according to a new poll

Clinton has the edge over Trump on a number of key issues in the poll ahead of the first presidential debate

(CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.

The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.

Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.

Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.

Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament.

Real_43-Webpage,“Public School Forced My Child To,"7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

“Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.”

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

“During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.”

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

“Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.”

It referenced the jihad as,

“a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years.

La Plata High School, a public high school located in Maryland, is facing serious allegations of indoctrinating students with Islamic teachings. The accusations stem from a lawsuit filed by parents John and Melissa Wood, represented by the Thomas More Law Center. The Woods claim that the school forced students to recite the Islamic statement of faith, known as the Shahada, and required them to memorize the five pillars of Islam.

John Wood has asserted that he was banned from school property after voicing his concerns regarding the Islamic teachings being imparted to students. Richard Thompson, President of the Thomas More Law Center, further alleges that Wood's daughter was compelled to disparage her Christian faith as part of the school's curriculum.

The lawsuit posits that for non-Muslim students, reciting the Shahada amounts to a conversion to Islam. This claim has raised significant concerns among parents and community members who believe that the school's actions may infringe upon the rights of students who practice different faiths.

The legal action names several individuals and entities, including Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and the Charles County Board of Education. However, officials from Charles County Public Schools have not issued any comments regarding the lawsuit.

According to the Woods, the lawsuit highlights deficiencies in the school's instruction on Christianity, asserting that it was inadequate and included disparaging remarks about the faith. The Woods argue that the school is unconstitutionally promoting Islam over Christianity and Judaism, thereby violating the principles of religious neutrality in public education.

The lawsuit also alleges that classroom materials presented to students taught that most Muslims have a stronger faith than average Christians. Additionally, these materials portrayed Islam as a peaceful religion, which the Woods contest. One handout reportedly claimed that the Koran does not advocate for martyrdom through suicide bombing and emphasized that the majority of Muslims do not support such actions. 

These allegations are said to have arisen during the 2014-2015 school year, and they have sparked a heated debate within the community about the role of religious education in public schools. The lawsuit raises questions about the balance between teaching about different religions and promoting one faith over others.

As the controversy unfolds, organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation have yet to comment on the case. The outcome of this lawsuit may set a significant precedent regarding the teaching of religious content in public schools and the rights of students and parents to challenge perceived indoctrination.

The situation at La Plata High School reflects broader national conversations about religious freedom, the separation of church and state, and the appropriate role of religious education in public schools. As the legal proceedings move forward, many will be watching closely to see how the court addresses these complex issues.",-5.0,-20.0,511.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.009784735812133072,529.0,-1.0,-0.03780718336483932

Real_47-Webpage,KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism,"“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can’t I?

Rock legend and KISS member Gene Simmons recently shared his thoughts on the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man accused of carrying out bombings in New York and New Jersey. In a candid interview with TMZ while at an airport, Simmons did not hold back, suggesting that Rahami ""should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend,"" a comment that sparked both laughter and contemplation about the serious nature of the topic.

Simmons took the opportunity to discuss his views on Islamic terrorism, advocating for a more proactive approach to security measures. He expressed frustration that the concept of profiling is often overlooked in discussions surrounding terrorism, stating, ""Nobody says the word ‘profile.’"" His remarks point to a belief that more targeted measures could help prevent future attacks and enhance public safety.

The KISS frontman went on to express his willingness to be profiled himself if it would contribute to ensuring safety for the general public. Acknowledging the potential for profiling to be perceived as unfair, Simmons remarked, “that’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist,” indicating a pragmatic approach to the complexities of security measures in today's world.

In a light-hearted twist, the article humorously speculated about the possibility of Simmons taking on the role of director of Homeland Security should a Trump presidency come to fruition. While this notion is purely speculative, it underscores the intersection of celebrity culture and public policy discussions in contemporary society.

It is important to note that all views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the stance of EagleRising.com. Simmons’ comments, while provocative, highlight the ongoing debate about how best to balance civil liberties with the need for security in an age marked by the threat of terrorism.

Real_48-Webpage,"Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'","(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""

""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""

Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.

Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.

Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.

""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""

""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""

""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""

Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016

In response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.

Danny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.",http://cnn.it/2cQyS4N,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,"Dan Merica,Eugene Scott",http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161118161709-cop-punches-woman-in-face-thumb-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718110446-02-officer-mohamed-noor-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717224427-justine-ruszczyk-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170711043320-georgia-police-beating-jnd-orig-vstop-00000612-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170104090632-north-carolina-school-body-slam-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170720014308-baltimore-pd-body-cam-video-release-02-large-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170626185531-jordan-edwards-roy-oliver-split-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712182221-florida-state-attorney-aramis-ayala-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170818111936-dashcam-video-ohio-violent-arrest-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160707080401-philando-castile-facebook-2-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520225617-georgia-man-tased-death-police-pkg-00012201-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717113139-australian-woman-minneapolis-police-shooting-nr-00000812-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718090944-betsy-hodges-7-18-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712054244-louisiana-couple-police-shooting-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160428084627-baltimore-teen-replica-gun-shot-dnt-00001823-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html,"{""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""author"": ""Eugene Scott and Dan Merica, CNN"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-col,col-controversial-police-incidents-"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Election 2016, US election, Tulsa, shooting, politics, Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable' - CNNPolitics"", ""article"": {""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202""}, ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-21T14:20:33Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced plans to implement best practices to prevent police-involved shootings.

In a significant move aimed at addressing the ongoing crisis of police-involved shootings in the United States, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, has announced a comprehensive plan that seeks to implement best practices to prevent such incidents. This initiative comes in the wake of recent high-profile shootings that have sparked national outrage and calls for reform.

Mook outlined two primary components of Clinton's strategy. The first involves establishing national standards for managing police situations, which is intended to enhance training for law enforcement officers. By focusing on proper training and protocols, the campaign aims to reduce the likelihood of police-involved shootings and ensure that officers are better equipped to handle tense situations.

The second component emphasizes the importance of improving relationships between police departments and minority communities. This will be achieved through community policing initiatives and the strategic allocation of resources to foster trust and cooperation. Mook's announcement underscores the campaign's commitment to bridging the gap between law enforcement and the communities they serve, particularly in areas that have historically experienced tension and mistrust.

Clinton’s campaign comes at a time when the nation is grappling with the effects of systematic racism, a topic that Clinton herself has addressed with urgency. Following the shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Clinton condemned the incident and the broader issues of racial injustice. She described the situation as ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable,"" calling for immediate action to combat systemic racism within the justice system.

The urgency of Clinton's message is further highlighted by the recent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, where demonstrations erupted following the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. During these protests, approximately 12 police officers sustained injuries, illustrating the heightened tensions surrounding police-community relations. Clinton has emphasized the need for a national dialogue on implicit bias, particularly regarding the disparities in treatment that different ethnic groups experience at the hands of law enforcement.

While acknowledging the existence of ""good, honorable"" police officers, Clinton has made it clear that improvements are necessary within the justice system. Her campaign's approach seeks to balance support for law enforcement with a critical examination of the practices that contribute to racial profiling and violence against minority communities.

In the aftermath of the Crutcher shooting, investigations were launched by both the Department of Justice and state authorities to determine potential civil rights violations. These investigations are part of a broader effort to hold law enforcement accountable and ensure that justice is served in cases of police misconduct.

Clinton's commitment to addressing these pressing issues was further demonstrated through her social media engagement. In a tweet addressing the Crutcher incident, she highlighted the need for change and acknowledged the ongoing work required to tackle systemic racism and police violence. Her message resonated with many who are advocating for reform and seeking justice for victims of police violence.

As the campaign progresses, Clinton's proposals aim to create a safer environment for all citizens by fostering accountability within law enforcement and promoting understanding between police and minority communities. The strategies outlined by Mook represent a significant step in addressing the complex issues surrounding police-involved shootings and the urgent need for systemic change.

The implications of these proposals could be far-reaching, potentially influencing both local and national policies regarding law enforcement practices. With the upcoming election, Clinton's focus on these critical issues may resonate with voters who are increasingly concerned about racial injustice and the need for meaningful reform in the wake of tragic incidents involving police violence.

In conclusion, Hillary Clinton's campaign is taking a proactive stance on police reform and the fight against systematic racism. By implementing best practices and fostering better relationships between law enforcement and communities of color, Clinton aims to drive the national conversation forward and work towards a more equitable justice system for all. As the nation continues to grapple with these challenges, the urgency of Clinton's proposals could play a pivotal role in shaping the future of policing and community relations in America.",-5.0,-13.0,656.0,-0.14705882352941177,-0.007621951219512195,757.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.017173051519154558
Real_49-Webpage,Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked,"Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked

Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager.

Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative.

Story Continued Below

“He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?”

Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.

Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.”

“So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked.

“You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.

In a highly anticipated presidential debate against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump is prepared to explain his strategy for defeating the Islamic State if the topic arises. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has confirmed that the former president possesses a detailed plan to combat the terrorist organization.

Conway took the opportunity to criticize Clinton for making her own strategy to defeat ISIS public on her campaign website. She argued that revealing such sensitive information could compromise national security and hinder effective action against the group.

While Trump has previously asserted his intention to ""knock the hell out of ISIS,"" he has refrained from disclosing specific details about his strategy. This approach aims to maintain operational secrecy and prevent the Islamic State from gaining insight into the tactics that might be employed against them.

Conway emphasized that voters can expect to learn more about Trump’s plan during the debate, ensuring that while some insights will be shared, the overarching strategies will remain undisclosed. This balance aims to inform the public while safeguarding the integrity of the plan.

As the debate approaches, all eyes will be on Trump to see how he articulates his vision for defeating ISIS and how it compares to Clinton’s publicly available strategy. The discussion is expected to be a significant point of contention, highlighting differing approaches to national security and the fight against terrorism.

With the stakes high and the election nearing, how both candidates frame their strategies may influence voter perceptions and decisions in the upcoming election. The debate promises to be a pivotal moment in the campaign, particularly regarding the critical issue of national security.",-11.0,-1.0,331.0,-1.1,-0.03323262839879154,314.0,-0.08333333333333333,-0.0031847133757961785

Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists.

During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear.

""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.""

""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens.

During his final appearance at the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan, President Obama reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to combating ISIS. His remarks come in the wake of recent attempts at mass violence that have stirred fear among Americans.

In light of these events, Obama sought to calm public anxieties, emphasizing that succumbing to fear only serves to benefit terrorists and disrupts the core values of American society. “We must not let fear dictate our actions,” he stated, reinforcing the importance of resilience in the face of adversity.

The President also took the opportunity to commend the swift actions of law enforcement in response to bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey. Their rapid response was critical in mitigating further harm and ensuring public safety, which Obama highlighted as a testament to the effectiveness of local authorities.

In his address, Obama expressed profound pride in the strength and resilience displayed by the residents of New York and New Jersey. He praised their toughness, asserting that the American spirit is not easily undermined by acts of terrorism. “We are a strong nation, and we will not allow these threats to define us,” he declared.

As investigations continue in Chelsea following a bomb explosion that injured dozens, the President's remarks serve as a reminder of the ongoing challenges posed by terrorism. His commitment to fighting ISIS remains steadfast, as he called for unity and resilience among Americans during these trying times. 

With his tenure drawing to a close, Obama’s message resonated with a sense of urgency and determination, reinforcing the notion that America will stand firm against the forces that seek to instill fear.",-6.0,3.0,331.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.01812688821752266,324.0,0.23076923076923078,0.009259259259259259
Real_50-Webpage,Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity,"United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.

The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.

At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.

""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.

Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""

JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45

""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.

""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""

The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.

A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.

Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.

""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""

Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.

""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.

""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.

The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.

""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement.

But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.

""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.""

The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.

The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.

""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""

Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.

""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.""

But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.

""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""

As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.

The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.

Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.

And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp.

""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said.",http://cnn.it/2deTou2,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg,Laura Koran,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920104405-02-obama-un-0920-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920152131-obama-united-nations-general-assembly-origwx-bw-00000210-exlarge-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920093742-obama-leaders-collage-edited-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html,"{""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""author"": ""Laura Koran"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,art-vid"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""politics, Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity - CNNPolitics"", ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-20T22:23:38Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- President Barack Obama urged countries to address the global refugee crisis at the United Nations, emphasizing a moral obligation to help those fleeing violence, particularly from the Middle East.

In a historic gathering at the United Nations, President Barack Obama called upon nations around the world to confront the escalating global refugee crisis, emphasizing a moral obligation to assist those fleeing violence, particularly from the tumultuous regions of the Middle East. This urgent appeal was made during the Leaders' Summit on Refugees, a pivotal event aimed at highlighting the plight of tens of millions of displaced individuals globally.

The summit comes at a critical juncture, with a staggering 65.3 million people reported displaced in 2015, according to a recent United Nations study. Among these, 21.3 million were classified as refugees, underscoring the magnitude of this humanitarian challenge. Obama, in his address, specifically pointed to the Syrian crisis, which has resulted in the displacement of 4.8 million people, labeling the situation as particularly ""unacceptable."" He warned that the world faces a humanitarian and security challenge that demands collective action, stating, “History will judge us harshly if we fail to act.”

In a pointed critique of the political climate in the United States regarding refugees, Obama rejected the notion of constructing a wall along the US-Mexico border, a thinly veiled reference to the rhetoric of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. This criticism comes amid a backdrop of increasing political resistance to refugee resettlement in the U.S., where the President’s spokesman acknowledged limited Congressional support for increased resources dedicated to refugee efforts.

The summit aimed to galvanize international action by setting ambitious goals, including a 30% increase in humanitarian funding, doubling the number of permanent resettlements, and expanding access to education and employment opportunities for refugees. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry underscored the urgency of these efforts, reiterating the need for a comprehensive response to the crisis.

While the summit was designed to build upon a previous UN meeting that raised awareness but fell short of binding commitments, aid groups expressed skepticism regarding the potential for significant action. David Miliband, of the International Rescue Committee, urged for a response that is both compassionate and competent, reflecting the gravity of the situation faced by millions.

European leaders, too, voiced their concerns, indicating a desire to manage refugee flows in a more orderly fashion. This sentiment reflects a growing recognition of the need for structured approaches to irregular migration, as many countries face increasing pressure to address the influx of refugees.

The summit also highlighted the contributions of world leaders, with co-hosts reporting significant humanitarian commitments. A collective goal of raising an additional $3 billion in global financing was set, reflecting the urgent need for resources to support displaced populations.

In a poignant demonstration of the human cost of the crisis, volunteers in London created a ""life jacket graveyard"" to raise awareness of the tragic deaths of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean. This artwork serves as a stark reminder of the perilous journeys many refugees undertake in search of safety and stability.

The refugee crisis is not confined to a single region; it is a global issue that sees developing countries in the southern hemisphere hosting a significant number of displaced individuals. New crises are emerging, such as the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, which continues to exacerbate the already dire situation.

As the summit concluded, the collective resolve of the international community to address the refugee crisis was palpable. However, the path forward remains fraught with challenges, as political rhetoric and resistance in various nations threaten to undermine efforts to provide sanctuary and support for those in need. The need for a unified, compassionate response is more pressing than ever, as the world grapples with the consequences of inaction and the moral imperative to assist those who have been uprooted by violence and conflict.

In the coming months, the effectiveness of the commitments made during the summit will be tested. With the U.S. planning to increase its refugee intake from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 in 2017, the focus will be on how these plans are implemented amid political resistance and logistical challenges. The response of the international community will be crucial in shaping the future for millions of refugees and displaced individuals seeking a chance at a better life. 

As nations reflect on their responsibilities, the words of President Obama echo: “We cannot turn our backs on the vulnerable. We must stand together to protect those who have lost everything.” The summit may have served as a platform for dialogue, but it is the actions taken in the aftermath that will ultimately determine the fate of countless lives caught in the throes of a global crisis. The world watches closely, as history will indeed judge those who choose to act—and those who choose to remain silent.",-13.0,-28.0,1293.0,-0.325,-0.010054137664346482,878.0,-1.0,-0.03189066059225513
Real_51-Webpage,Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings,"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues

It's a recurring theme of his campaign

Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions.

The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law.

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.

""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

Real_52-Webpage,In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism,"Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.

The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.

But the ""he said/she said"" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics.

Story Continued Below

While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?

In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.

Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.

But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.

As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both ""he said and she said""—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.

One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?

I don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.

The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.

Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.

Obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.

The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.”

Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.

The last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”

If you’re not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.

In the landscape of modern journalism, the ""he said/she said"" method has long been a staple, offering a semblance of balance in reporting. However, this approach has come under fire since 2009, particularly from influential voices like New York University professor Jay Rosen. Critics argue that this format creates an artificial symmetry between opposing views, often leading to a distortion of truth in political journalism. As the media grapples with the complexities of political discourse, the implications of this journalistic style have become increasingly pronounced, especially in the context of recent events.

A notable shift in this conversation was highlighted in a recent article by Michael Barbaro in The New York Times, where he openly criticized former President Donald Trump as a liar. This marked a significant departure from the traditional balanced reporting that has characterized much of political journalism. The bluntness of Barbaro's assertion drew attention and sparked debate among journalists and commentators alike. Critics such as Peter Beinart have expressed praise for the Times' move away from mechanical balance, arguing that blunt truth-telling is necessary in an era where misinformation can easily take root.

The crux of the argument against the ""he said/she said"" format lies in its tendency to present every politician's statements as equally valid, regardless of their veracity. The notion that every politician lies is not a new one, but the implications of abandoning the ""he said/she said"" approach could lead to a collapse of political journalism as we know it. Rosen points out that the ""he said/she said"" method can create a false equivalence between opposing views, which can mislead the public and undermine the integrity of journalistic reporting. He urges journalists to prioritize truth over the appearance of neutrality, especially in a political climate rife with misinformation.

The impact of Trump's manipulation of the ""he said/she said"" convention cannot be overlooked. His presidency has brought to light how this format can be weaponized to distort reality, complicating the already challenging landscape of political discourse. By framing his statements within the ""he said/she said"" context, Trump has effectively blurred the lines between fact and fiction, leading to confusion among the electorate and further complicating the role of journalists.

Despite the criticisms levied against the ""he said/she said"" approach, there remains a belief among some that this format encourages thorough reporting and supports skeptical readers. By presenting dissenting views, or the ""she said"" component, journalists can foster an environment of open inquiry. This is particularly important in an age where bias in reporting is a growing concern. The inclusion of diverse perspectives can help to mitigate the risk of echo chambers, allowing readers to engage with multiple sides of an issue.

Historical examples from the field of science illustrate the value of minority views in challenging dominant paradigms. Just as dissenting voices in scientific discourse have led to breakthroughs and advancements, the inclusion of differing opinions in journalism can enhance knowledge and understanding. The author of the article argues that these dissenting voices should not be silenced but rather included in the narrative to foster a well-rounded understanding of complex issues.

The importance of providing both sides of a story cannot be overstated. In a media landscape increasingly characterized by polarization, the ""he said/she said"" format serves as a crucial tool in combating media echo chambers. By encouraging critical thinking among readers, this approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the issues at hand. The presence of dissenting views challenges readers to question their own assumptions and engage more deeply with the material.

In conclusion, while the ""he said/she said"" journalism method has faced significant criticism, it continues to maintain journalistic integrity in an era of heightened political tension. Even when it appears to benefit controversial figures like Trump, the format serves a purpose in promoting thorough reporting and fostering open inquiry. As the media navigates the complexities of political discourse, the challenge remains to balance the need for truth with the imperative of providing a platform for diverse perspectives. Ultimately, the evolution of this journalistic approach will shape the future of political reporting and the public's understanding of the political landscape.",6.0,0.0,2265.0,0.06593406593406594,0.0026490066225165563,793.0,0.0,0.0
Real_53-Webpage,Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. […] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”

Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a prominent figure in conservative media and a vocal supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, is under intense scrutiny following the death of an inmate in the county jail. Terrill Thomas, 38, died on April 24, nine days after his arrest related to a shooting. Reports indicate that he succumbed to profound dehydration, which the Milwaukee County medical examiner has ruled a homicide.

Inmates have come forward with alarming accounts, stating that Thomas begged for water before his death. They reported that his cell’s water supply was cut off for six days, raising serious concerns about the conditions within the jail under Clarke’s command. Despite warnings to jailers regarding the potential risk to Thomas's life, the situation reportedly went unaddressed.

Attorney Erik J. Heipt, who is representing the Thomas family, has received multiple reports from inmates regarding similar instances of water being cut off in their cells. He highlighted that this is not an isolated incident, referencing a similar occurrence from 2011. The details surrounding Thomas's death have ignited a broader conversation about the treatment of inmates and the responsibilities of jail officials.

Clarke, who has gained notoriety as a frequent guest on Fox News, has been an outspoken critic of the Black Lives Matter movement, drawing controversial comparisons between the movement and international terrorists. His strong alignment with Trump was evident when he addressed the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, further solidifying his position within the party.

In addition to his political engagements, Clarke has reportedly earned over $150,000 in 2015 from speaking fees, travel reimbursements, and gifts, highlighting his dual role as a law enforcement official and a political commentator. Clarke is currently involved in a pro-Trump bus tour organized by a supporting super PAC, which could further complicate his leadership role in the sheriff's department as the investigation into Thomas's death unfolds.

As calls for accountability grow louder, the Milwaukee community is left grappling with the implications of Thomas's tragic death and the broader issues of inmate treatment in the county jail system.",-25.0,-21.0,375.0,-1.9230769230769231,-0.06666666666666667,407.0,-1.5,-0.051597051597051594

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?”

In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

“I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

In a recent interview, Janet Brown, the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), expressed her opposition to the practice of fact-checking during presidential debates. Her comments have sparked significant discussion about the role of truth in political discourse, particularly in the context of the upcoming election.

Brown raised concerns about the feasibility of distinguishing between ""big facts"" and ""little facts,"" arguing that the subjectivity of sources complicates the process of verification. This perspective aligns closely with the preferences of the Trump campaign, which has been vocal about its desire for unchallenged statements during debates. The implications of this stance are profound, as it raises questions about the integrity of the debate format and the information presented to the public.

The backdrop to Brown's comments is Donald Trump's well-documented history of making false statements. Politico has reported that Trump lies approximately once every three minutes and 15 seconds while on the campaign trail. His fabrications have included misstatements regarding critical issues such as the Iraq war, health care policies, and exaggerated claims about crime rates and polling leads. This pattern of dishonesty has led to a stark comparison between Trump and his political rival, Hillary Clinton, revealing that Trump's level of deceit significantly exceeds that of Clinton.

The implications of Brown's stance on fact-checking have not gone unnoticed by journalists, who have expressed frustration over the CPD's position. Many have questioned the role of moderators in debates if they are not permitted to fact-check candidates' statements. The purpose of a debate is to inform voters, and the lack of accountability for candidates could undermine this goal. Journalists argue that without the ability to challenge falsehoods, the integrity of the entire debate process is at risk.

On the other hand, Trump's supporters have celebrated Brown's comments, recognizing that the absence of fact-checking could provide a strategic advantage for the Trump campaign. By allowing unchallenged statements, the campaign may be able to sidestep scrutiny and maintain a narrative that appeals to its base. This dynamic raises important questions about the ethical implications of political strategy and the responsibility of candidates to present truthful information.

The article suggests that if a political party's strategy relies on permitting lies during debates, it may warrant a reevaluation of that party's principles. The acceptance of falsehoods as a means to gain political advantage could have long-term consequences for the political landscape and the relationship between candidates and voters. As the election approaches, the discourse surrounding truth and accountability in politics will likely become increasingly critical.

In conclusion, Janet Brown's opposition to fact-checking during presidential debates has ignited a debate about the role of honesty in political discourse. With the Trump campaign's preference for unchallenged statements and the documented frequency of Trump's falsehoods, the integrity of the debate format is under scrutiny. As journalists and political observers grapple with these issues, the implications for the upcoming election and the broader political landscape remain to be seen.",11.0,8.0,839.0,0.3235294117647059,0.013110846245530394,567.0,0.36363636363636365,0.014109347442680775

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.

“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.

“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

In the wake of the recent debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, political commentator Kellyanne Conway has publicly commended Trump for his measured approach during the contentious face-off. Conway highlighted Trump’s decision to exercise restraint, particularly when it came to making personal attacks on Clinton, who was accompanied by her family during the event. This choice, she argues, reflects a crucial presidential virtue that may resonate more profoundly in the coming days as the campaign unfolds.

During the debate, Clinton did not shy away from criticizing Trump, targeting his history of derogatory remarks about women. She labeled him as disrespectful, aiming to undermine his candidacy by bringing attention to his past comments. However, Conway noted that Trump had considered making a pointed remark regarding Bill Clinton’s record with women but ultimately chose to hold back. This decision, she believes, demonstrates a level of maturity and restraint that is often overlooked in the heat of political battles.

Conway expressed her appreciation for Trump’s approach, suggesting that it sets a tone of dignity that could be beneficial as the election campaign progresses. ""His restraint is a presidential virtue,"" she stated, emphasizing that such qualities are essential for anyone seeking the highest office in the land. The implications of this restraint could play a significant role in shaping public perception as voters evaluate the candidates’ character and leadership qualities.

Despite Trump’s cautious demeanor, Conway did not miss the opportunity to critique Clinton’s performance during the debate. She argued that Clinton failed to deliver a significant moment or what some might refer to as a ""knockout punch."" According to Conway, Clinton appeared overly rehearsed, concentrating on her talking points rather than engaging with the questions posed to her. This approach, she contended, detracted from her ability to connect with voters and present a compelling vision for the future.

Conway further noted that Clinton’s inability to articulate a clear plan for economic growth could alienate many Americans who are eager for change. ""She did not provide a compelling vision that would resonate with the majority of Americans,"" Conway stated, alluding to the prevailing sentiment among voters who desire a different direction for the country. This lack of a substantive economic message, she argued, could be detrimental to Clinton's campaign as it moves forward.

In the aftermath of the debate, Trump reiterated his rationale for choosing restraint, citing the presence of Clinton’s family as a significant factor in his decision-making process. This acknowledgment of family dynamics added a layer of complexity to the debate, illustrating the personal stakes involved in political discourse. Conway believes that this aspect of Trump’s character could resonate positively with voters, particularly those who value family and respect in public life.

The contrasting styles of the two candidates were evident throughout the debate, with Trump’s restraint standing in stark contrast to Clinton’s aggressive attacks. As the election season continues to unfold, the implications of their respective strategies will undoubtedly shape the narrative surrounding both candidates. Conway’s insights provide a glimpse into how Trump’s approach may be perceived favorably by some voters, while Clinton's performance raises questions about her effectiveness as a candidate.

As the political landscape evolves, the significance of character, restraint, and the ability to connect with the electorate will remain at the forefront of discussions. Conway's analysis underscores the importance of these qualities in the context of a heated election, where every decision and statement can have far-reaching consequences. 

In conclusion, the debate served not only as a platform for policy discussion but also as a reflection of the candidates' personalities and their respective approaches to leadership. As voters prepare to make their choices, the lessons learned from this debate will likely echo throughout the campaign, influencing public opinion and voter turnout in the months ahead.",5.0,21.0,650.0,0.35714285714285715,0.007692307692307693,745.0,0.7777777777777778,0.028187919463087248

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

[A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,,https://www.washingtonpost.com,{'$date': 1474243200000},,"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg&w=60,https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,"{""theme"": ""normal"", ""news_keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Washington Post"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste."", ""title"": ""France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery"", ""url"": ""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""image"": ""https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""unsafe-url"", ""twitter"": {""site"": ""@WashingtonPost"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""creator"": ""jameskmcauley""}, ""object-hash"": 1503984085, ""robots"": ""index,follow"", ""apple-itunes-app"": ""app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 500835072, ""app_id"": 41245586762}, ""keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste.""}","- France has become the first country to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils, effective in 2020.

France has made a significant move in environmental policy by becoming the first country to implement a ban on plastic plates, cups, and utensils, effective from 2020. This groundbreaking legislation is part of the broader Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, which also addresses the use of plastic bags in grocery stores, prohibiting them since July. The French government has positioned this ban as a crucial step in promoting sustainable practices and reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste.

Under the new regulations, exceptions will be made for products made from compostable and biosourced materials, allowing for some flexibility in the transition away from traditional plastic items. This approach aligns with France’s commitment to fostering a ""circular economy,"" which emphasizes responsible waste disposal, innovative product design, and enhanced recycling efforts. The law aims to minimize the detrimental effects of plastic on the environment, particularly as plastic does not biodegrade and poses significant threats to wildlife and ecosystems.

French President François Hollande has been a vocal supporter of the ban, framing it as part of the nation’s larger strategy to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing reliance on renewable energy sources. The move has garnered attention as a potential model for other nations grappling with similar environmental challenges.

However, the ban has not been without controversy. Critics argue that it may infringe upon European Union laws that govern the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers. Pack2Go Europe, a trade association representing the interests of manufacturers and suppliers of single-use packaging, has announced plans to challenge the ban legally. They are calling on the European Commission to take action against France, asserting that the legislation could create unfair barriers to trade and disrupt established market practices within the EU.

The journey to this ban has not been straightforward. Advocates for the ban initially sought to have it enacted in 2017, but the timeline was delayed due to concerns regarding the potential economic impact on low-income families. The postponement allowed for further discussions about the implications of the ban and how to mitigate any adverse effects on vulnerable populations.

As the ban approaches its implementation date, discussions continue around the potential impact on consumers and businesses alike. Supporters of the legislation argue that the long-term environmental benefits far outweigh the short-term challenges. They believe that transitioning to more sustainable materials is essential for safeguarding the planet for future generations.

The French government’s bold step to ban plastic tableware sets a significant precedent on the global stage, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive action against plastic pollution. As countries worldwide grapple with the environmental ramifications of plastic waste, France's initiative may inspire similar policies in other nations, encouraging a collective shift towards sustainability and environmental responsibility. 

In conclusion, France's ban on plastic plates, cups, and utensils marks a pivotal moment in the fight against plastic pollution, reflecting a growing recognition of the need for innovative solutions to tackle environmental challenges. As the country moves forward with this legislation, the eyes of the world will be watching to see how it unfolds and what lessons can be learned in the pursuit of a greener future.",-14.0,-7.0,529.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.026465028355387523,598.0,-0.3181818181818182,-0.011705685618729096
Real_57-Webpage,Paul Ryan ducks on stop-and-frisk,"Story highlights Ryan called for calm in Charlotte, but would not comment on Trump's ""stop and frisk"" proposals

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump.

""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,"" Ryan said.

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.

But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.

What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.

The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said.

As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first?

Charlotte, North Carolina – The shooting of a black man by Charlotte police has ignited a wave of speculation and anger, leading to significant unrest in the city. Protests have escalated into riots, resulting in looting and theft, while major thoroughfares, including I-85, have been shut down as tensions reached a boiling point.

The victim, identified as 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, has been portrayed in the narrative as an innocent individual who was on his way to volunteer. This characterization has fueled public outrage and has been central to the protests that have erupted in the wake of the incident. However, this portrayal has sparked a critical examination of the police's perspective and raised questions about whether it will shift public sentiment amidst the ongoing chaos.

In a news conference addressing the incident, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney provided insight into the circumstances surrounding the shooting. According to Chief Putney, officers were actively searching for a suspect when they encountered Scott, who exited a vehicle while armed with a handgun. The Chief stated that officers instructed Scott to drop the weapon, but he exited the vehicle a second time still holding the gun. Chief Putney emphasized that Scott posed a direct threat to the officers, which he argued justified their decision to use lethal force.

The Chief's comments have ignited further debate about the narrative surrounding the incident. He urged the public to reconsider the portrayal of the events, asserting that the facts differ significantly from the images and stories circulating on social media. This appeal for a more nuanced understanding of the situation comes at a time when public trust in law enforcement is being challenged.

As protests have intensified, critics of progressive viewpoints on law enforcement actions have emerged, suggesting a disconnect between the opinions of some activists and the realities faced by police officers on the ground. The riots have highlighted the complexities of policing in urban environments, especially in communities grappling with issues of race and inequality.

The unrest in Charlotte has drawn attention not only to the specific incident involving Scott but also to broader societal issues surrounding police conduct and community relations. Amidst the chaos, the community remains divided, with many demanding accountability for the police while others call for a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges law enforcement faces.

As the situation continues to evolve, the city of Charlotte is at a crossroads. The riots and protests have underscored the urgent need for dialogue and understanding between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The question remains whether this tragic incident will catalyze meaningful change or further entrench divisions within the community.

In the days following the shooting, the atmosphere in Charlotte remains tense. Many residents are grappling with their emotions as they navigate the complexities of race, justice, and law enforcement. The coming weeks will likely see continued calls for transparency and accountability from the police, as well as ongoing protests as community members seek to make their voices heard.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of this tragic event, the path forward will require careful consideration of the narratives being constructed and the realities faced by both the community and law enforcement. Only through open dialogue and a commitment to understanding can the city hope to heal and move forward from this moment of crisis.",-23.0,-32.0,562.0,-0.9583333333333334,-0.04092526690391459,620.0,-1.3333333333333333,-0.05161290322580645

ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June.

The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

""The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,"" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. ""As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.""

Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.

Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.

Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.

President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change.

The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.”

And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.”

The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both.

""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012

""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,"" Obama said, ""that worries me.""

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is ""naturally occurring.""

Former President Barack Obama has reiterated his critical stance on Donald Trump following the recent debate, emphasizing concerns about Trump's preparedness and temperament for the presidency. In a revealing interview with Ryan Seacrest, Obama articulated his worries about Trump's capability to manage pressing global issues, particularly nuclear weapons and climate change.

Obama pointed out that Trump's approach to these serious matters raises alarms for future generations. He expressed skepticism about Trump's ability to navigate the complexities associated with nuclear weaponry, particularly in light of the candidate's controversial remarks regarding the defense of Japan and Korea. Trump suggested that these nations should consider developing their own nuclear arsenals, a statement that Obama found troubling and indicative of a lack of understanding of international security dynamics.

In stark contrast, Obama praised Hillary Clinton's debate performance, highlighting her qualifications and preparedness. He described Clinton as someone who is serious about the issues and diligent in her research, underscoring the importance of having a leader who is well-informed and ready to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.

Furthermore, Obama criticized Trump for what he perceives as a deficiency in core values, particularly in terms of inclusion and the provision of opportunities for all Americans. He argued that such values are essential for a leader and expressed concern that Trump’s rhetoric does not align with the principles that promote unity and progress in the nation.

On the subject of climate change, Obama condemned Trump’s past assertion that it is a hoax created by China. He emphasized the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change as an urgent and critical issue that must be addressed. In response to these concerns, Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has stated that Trump views climate change as ""naturally occurring,"" a position that diverges significantly from the scientific community's understanding of human-induced climate impacts.

As the election approaches, Obama’s critique of Trump underscores a broader narrative about the qualifications and values necessary for effective leadership in an increasingly complex world. With pressing issues like nuclear security and climate change at the forefront of global discourse, the former president's remarks resonate with voters who prioritize informed and responsible governance.",-7.0,0.0,419.0,-0.5833333333333334,-0.016706443914081145,418.0,0.0,0.0
Real_60-Webpage,How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying “yes” to Fox News almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning, he is booked on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn’t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

In a notable shift from his previous approach, former President Donald Trump has recently retreated from broad media engagement, opting to engage primarily with Fox News. Known for his openness to media interview requests during his presidency, Trump now focuses almost exclusively on the conservative network, appearing frequently on programs like ""Fox & Friends"" and ""The O’Reilly Factor."" 

This strategic pivot appears to be aimed at energizing his core supporters rather than appealing to undecided voters. By limiting his media interactions to a familiar platform, Trump can cultivate a narrative that resonates with his base. However, this approach comes with significant risks. By choosing to engage primarily with Fox News, Trump effectively shields himself from challenging questions posed by journalists who might bring up difficult or controversial topics. This controlled environment allows him to avoid scrutiny and maintain a comfortable dialogue, but it also raises concerns about his ability to connect with a broader electorate.

Critics argue that this strategy may alienate potential voters outside of Trump’s established base. Unlike successful politicians of the past, Trump's campaign appears to lack a robust outreach initiative to swing districts, which could be crucial in a competitive electoral landscape. The reliance on a single media outlet may lead to a disconnect reminiscent of the 2012 election, where former candidate Mitt Romney faced challenges in appealing to a diverse voter base.

While Trump's choice to engage primarily with Fox News may provide him with a platform to rally his supporters, it also risks creating an echo chamber that could hinder his broader electoral ambitions. As the political landscape evolves, the effectiveness of this strategy remains to be seen. Will Trump’s focus on energizing his base through selective media engagement ultimately pay off, or will it limit his appeal and lead to missed opportunities with undecided voters?

As the election cycle progresses, it will be crucial to monitor how Trump's media strategy impacts his campaign and whether he adapts to reach a wider audience.

Real_61-Webpage,“Why Aren’t I 50 Points Ahead?” – Eagle Rising,"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again.

Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.

But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.”

For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.

Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump?

At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question:

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

As the 2016 presidential election draws near, the atmosphere surrounding Hillary Clinton's campaign has shifted dramatically. Initially, many liberals believed Clinton's victory was a foregone conclusion, viewing the campaign as merely a formality. However, recent developments have forced a reassessment of the race's competitiveness, particularly as Donald Trump gains traction in key battleground states.

Clinton's campaign strategy has come under scrutiny, particularly her decision to minimize press contact. This approach allowed Trump to dominate media attention, raising concerns among her supporters. The post-Democratic National Convention (DNC) landscape has been sobering for Clinton, as the reality of a competitive election has set in. Recent polling indicates that Trump is leading in several pivotal states, a stark contrast to the expectations that once surrounded Clinton's candidacy.

Amid these challenges, Clinton has also faced personal health issues, prompting some Democrats to contemplate a ""Plan B."" The uncertainty surrounding her campaign has led to increased anxiety among her supporters, who are eager for a decisive victory. During a recent campaign event in Las Vegas, Clinton expressed her frustration, questioning why she wasn't ""50 points ahead"" of Trump, highlighting the unexpected tightness of the race.

In response to the shifting dynamics, Clinton has sought to clarify the stakes of the election. In her speeches, she has emphasized the clarity of the choice facing working families, urging her supporters to help disseminate her message against Trump. She has called on her backers to engage in discussions about the facts, particularly with those who may be considering voting for the Republican candidate.

Clinton's rallying cry included an appeal for supporters to ""stage an intervention"" for anyone contemplating a vote for Trump, underscoring the importance of addressing misinformation and rallying the Democratic base. As the election approaches, the urgency for Clinton's campaign is palpable, with the need to galvanize support becoming increasingly critical.

In a race that has become more unpredictable than many anticipated, Clinton’s campaign is now at a crossroads. With Trump’s rising popularity and the looming specter of health concerns, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. As the clock ticks down, both candidates are preparing for what promises to be a fiercely contested battle for the presidency.",11.0,23.0,413.0,0.6875,0.026634382566585957,446.0,1.2777777777777777,0.0515695067264574

Over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, Bobby Knight said Wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like Donald Trump.

""There’s nobody that I’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right,"" Knight told an audience in Toledo, Ohio, his home state. ""And I think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United States. And there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been Donald Trump.""

Story Continued Below

Back on the campaign trail with Trump after several months, Knight extolled the Republican nominee as ""not just an American; he’s a world figure.""

""He’s known all over the world. Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together,"" the coach continued. ""United States around the world. A lot of businesses. Created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world.""

And Trump, Knight later indicated, is the person for the White House.

""Believe me when I tell you, I think you’re all gonna agree on this: Our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the United States of America,"" Knight said. He noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, ""immigration problems and on and on.""

Remarking on his study of history, Knight said that he had come to the conclusion that ""when I need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man I want to choose and the first man I want to see.""

Knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't ""dress as well as politicians dress, but I want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, I wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""

""And I think that when you leave, I hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the United States,"" Knight said.

Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it.

Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation.

That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.

ELIZABETH, NJ – Authorities are investigating the discovery of three pipe bombs and two smaller explosive devices found in a trash can near the New Jersey Transit (NJT) Station in Elizabeth. The alarming find was confirmed by Elizabeth Mayor, who stated that the FBI is currently on the scene, working to ascertain the details surrounding the incident.

The discovery of these devices has raised concerns, particularly given the recent history of bomb incidents along the Jersey Shore and in New York. Speculation is growing that a small team or an individual could be behind the bombings, leading to fears of a coordinated effort to instill terror in the region.

While the motive behind these devices remains uncertain, authorities are considering various possibilities. Islamic terrorism has been suggested as a likely motive, reflecting broader concerns regarding national security. However, the investigation also recalls the historical presence of ""mad bombers,"" individuals who have previously engaged in similar acts without clear ideological motivations.

The FBI's involvement comes on the heels of recent arrests linked to the Chelsea bombing investigation, where five individuals were taken into custody. As of now, no formal charges have been filed against these suspects, but their connection to the ongoing investigation is being scrutinized.

The situation remains fluid, with details still emerging. Local law enforcement agencies are on high alert as they work in tandem with federal authorities to investigate the potential threats posed by these explosive devices. The public has been urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity as the investigation unfolds.

Mayor of Elizabeth has reassured residents that their safety is a top priority and that measures are being taken to ensure the community remains secure during this troubling time. As the FBI continues to gather evidence and assess the situation, further updates are expected in the coming days.

Real_64-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on Between Two Ferns: 'I really regret doing this',"Story highlights The interview is part of the Clinton campaign's attempt to show a funnier, softer side

President Barack Obama also sat down with Zach Galifianakis to tout the Affordable Care Act

(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it.

Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video , plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself.

""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs.

Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump.

""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention.

Magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect

A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said.

""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening.

Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami.

""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer.""

The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.

Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

The defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, James Patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.

In a significant legal development, federal magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein has denied a request for the immediate arraignment of bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami on federal charges. The decision was made during a recent hearing, highlighting the complexities surrounding Rahami's custody status and the jurisdiction of the court.

Currently, Rahami is in local custody in New Jersey, as confirmed by Judge Gorenstein. The magistrate emphasized that the federal government has denied any involvement in Rahami's arrest and there is no evidence suggesting that he is in federal custody. This clarification is crucial, as it delineates the boundaries between state and federal legal processes in this high-profile case.

The magistrate also addressed the defense's argument that federal court rules necessitate a prompt arraignment, regardless of state arrest. Gorenstein firmly rejected this claim, stating that the legal framework does not support the defense's position. This ruling underscores the complexities of navigating between local and federal jurisdictions, particularly in cases involving serious charges such as bombing.

Furthermore, Judge Gorenstein declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who is currently being treated at a Newark hospital. The magistrate noted that he lacks the authority to assign a federal defense attorney to Rahami at this time, adding another layer of complication to the proceedings. The situation remains fluid, as the legal team and authorities work to establish the next steps in the case.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch has indicated that Rahami will be transported to New York City soon to face federal charges. This announcement raises questions about the timing and logistics of the transfer, as well as the implications for Rahami's legal representation.

The U.S. Attorney's office, led by Preet Bharara, has chosen not to comment on the magistrate's ruling, leaving many details surrounding the case shrouded in uncertainty. The lack of commentary from the prosecution may suggest a strategic decision to maintain focus on the case's legal proceedings rather than public discourse.

Meanwhile, defense attorney James Patton has also not responded to requests for comment regarding the magistrate's decision, further contributing to the ambiguity surrounding the case. The legal community and the public are keenly observing the developments, as Rahami's case raises significant questions about the intersection of state and federal law, particularly in matters of national security and public safety.

As the situation evolves, the implications of the magistrate's ruling will likely resonate throughout the legal system, influencing how similar cases are approached in the future. The next steps for Ahmad Rahami remain uncertain, but the anticipation of his upcoming transfer to New York City marks a pivotal moment in this unfolding legal saga.",-25.0,-7.0,471.0,-1.5625,-0.05307855626326964,499.0,-0.3684210526315789,-0.014028056112224449
Real_66-Webpage,US: ISIS did not use mustard agent in base attack,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL — OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

Real_67-Webpage,"Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say","The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.

""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.

Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.

A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.

The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.

""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.

He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""

James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.

""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.

""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg,"More Meghan,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997,"{""fb_title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@mkeneally"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-19"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-19 18:04:32"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race""}","- Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have heightened interest in presidential candidates' national security policies.

The recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, coupled with a violent stabbing incident in Minnesota, have intensified the focus on national security policies among presidential candidates. As the nation grapples with the aftermath of these attacks, which resulted in numerous injuries, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have weighed in, highlighting the growing importance of security issues in the current political landscape.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, has indicated that these incidents could significantly sway voter sentiment as the election approaches. He pointed out that fear often drives voters towards candidates they perceive as strong on security, suggesting that the recent attacks may alter the dynamics of the race.

Prior to the attacks, national polling data indicated that Clinton held a lead over Trump regarding public trust in handling terrorism. An ABC News/Washington Post poll revealed that 50% of adults trusted Clinton more compared to 41% for Trump. Among likely voters, the numbers were closer, with Clinton at 48% and Trump at 45%. Similarly, a CBS/New York Times poll showed that 49% of respondents trusted Clinton more on terrorism and national security, while 45% favored Trump. A Quinnipiac poll echoed this sentiment, with Clinton at 49% and Trump at 47% concerning keeping the country safe from terrorism.

Cohen noted that historically, the Republican Party has been viewed as the stronger party in terms of law enforcement and homeland security. However, he observed a shift in this perception, particularly due to concerns surrounding Trump's grasp on national security issues. As the candidates recalibrate their campaign strategies in response to the recent events, it is evident that national security is now a pivotal topic.

Cohen also expressed concern that Trump's rhetoric could inadvertently inspire further attacks. His controversial calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States have raised alarms among security experts, who fear such statements could exacerbate tensions and lead to increased violence.

In contrast, James Campbell, a political science professor, posited that the recent attacks could ultimately benefit Trump while posing challenges for Clinton. He argued that these incidents may be perceived as failures of the current administration's foreign policy, potentially swaying voters towards Trump's more hardline stance on immigration and security. Campbell suggested that a pattern of frequent attacks might lead to an increased public appetite for tougher immigration policies, which have been central to Trump’s campaign.

As the political landscape evolves in the wake of these attacks, both candidates are being forced to confront the implications of national security on their campaigns. The urgency of the situation is palpable, with voters increasingly concerned about their safety and the effectiveness of their leaders in addressing these threats.

The ongoing dialogue surrounding national security is likely to shape the electoral narrative in the coming weeks and months. With the stakes higher than ever, both Clinton and Trump must navigate the complex terrain of public sentiment, security concerns, and their own campaign strategies. As the nation watches closely, the impact of these recent events on the presidential race remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: national security will be at the forefront of voters' minds as they head to the polls.",6.0,-5.0,604.0,0.3333333333333333,0.009933774834437087,617.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.008103727714748784

When is the first general election presidential debate?

The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.

Story Continued Below

What time is the debate and how long is it?

The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.

How can I watch the debate?

It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.

Who will participate in the debate?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.

Who will moderate the debate?

Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.

What is the format of the debate?

The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.

Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?

Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.

What's at stake for Hillary Clinton?

The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.

What's at stake for Donald Trump?

Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again.

What is the most watched debate in presidential history?

In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.

What's the most-watched television moment of all time?

Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.

Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.

The stage is set for the first general election presidential debate of 2016, taking place on September 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. The highly anticipated event will commence at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and is scheduled to last for a full 90 minutes without any commercial breaks, allowing for uninterrupted discourse between the candidates.

The debate will be broadcast across major television networks and will also be available for streaming on the websites of prominent cable news channels, as well as on C-SPAN. This accessibility ensures that millions of viewers will be able to tune in to witness the unfolding of a pivotal moment in the presidential race.

Participants in the debate will include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and real estate mogul Donald Trump. Notably, no other candidates have qualified to participate, as the debate commission has set a stringent 15 percent polling threshold that both Jill Stein and Gary Johnson failed to meet. This decision has effectively narrowed the field to the two leading candidates, heightening the stakes for both Clinton and Trump.

Lester Holt, the anchor of ""NBC Nightly News,"" will serve as the moderator for the evening. This marks Holt's second time fulfilling this role during the 2016 presidential cycle, and he is expected to guide the candidates through a structured debate format. The debate will consist of six segments, each lasting 15 minutes. Holt will initiate the discussion with questions, after which each candidate will have the opportunity to respond for two minutes.

Tentative topics for the debate are expected to cover crucial issues such as ""America's direction,"" ""achieving prosperity,"" and ""securing America."" However, these topics are subject to change, reflecting the dynamic nature of current events leading up to the debate. This flexibility allows the candidates to address the most pressing concerns facing the nation.

For Hillary Clinton, the debate presents a critical opportunity to regain momentum in her campaign. In recent weeks, she has seen her polling lead diminish in the face of Trump's rising popularity. Clinton aims to leverage her extensive policy knowledge and debate experience to effectively communicate her vision for the country and to reassert her position as a formidable candidate.

On the other hand, Donald Trump faces a unique set of challenges as he prepares for the debate. With perceptions surrounding his policy knowledge and self-restraint, Trump must navigate these concerns while also capitalizing on the lower expectations set for him. His supporters believe that a strong performance could significantly bolster his campaign, while detractors will be closely scrutinizing his responses and demeanor.

The historical significance of presidential debates cannot be understated. The most-watched debate in U.S. history occurred in 1980 when then-President Jimmy Carter faced off against Ronald Reagan, drawing an astounding 80.6 million viewers. This figure underscores the potential for the upcoming debate to capture the attention of a wide audience as voters seek to inform themselves ahead of the election.

While the debate may not reach the viewership numbers of Super Bowl XLIX, which remains the most-watched television program in U.S. history with 114 million viewers, it nevertheless holds considerable importance in the electoral process. Historical events, such as the moon landing and royal weddings, have drawn even larger global audiences, but the presidential debate serves as a critical platform for candidates to articulate their policies and connect with voters.

As the date approaches, anticipation builds for what promises to be a defining moment in the 2016 presidential election. With both candidates facing high stakes, the debate at Hofstra University is set to be a pivotal event that could shape the trajectory of their campaigns. Voters across the nation will be watching closely, eager to hear the candidates’ visions for the future of America and to assess their readiness to lead the country.

In conclusion, the first presidential debate of 2016 is poised to be a landmark event, with significant implications for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As they prepare to face each other on stage, the candidates will need to effectively convey their messages and engage with the pressing issues that matter most to the American electorate. With millions expected to tune in, the debate will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the unfolding narrative of the election season.",14.0,41.0,780.0,0.3684210526315789,0.017948717948717947,803.0,1.3225806451612903,0.05105853051058531
Real_69-Webpage,U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court,"Under the Radar Blog Archives Select Date… July, 2017 June, 2017 May, 2017 April, 2017 March, 2017 February, 2017 January, 2017 December, 2016 November, 2016 October, 2016 September, 2016 August, 2016

Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday in Linden, N.J. | Nicolaus Czarnecki/Boston Herald via AP U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing.

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.

However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved.

""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""

The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.

Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.

While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.

The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.

Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.

Ahmad Khan Rahami remains in custody after a dramatic shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. The incident has escalated into a complex legal battle, as federal prosecutors have opposed a request from Rahami's defense attorneys for an immediate arraignment on federal charges.

Rahami's defense team has formally requested that he be informed of the charges against him and advised of his rights during a court proceeding. However, federal prosecutors have countered this request by asserting that Rahami is not currently in federal custody. Instead, he is facing state charges in New Jersey, complicating the legal proceedings surrounding his case.

A writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged for Rahami, but it has not yet been executed. This means that he has not been transferred to federal authorities, leaving his legal status in a state of uncertainty. Currently, Rahami is facing five counts of attempted murder related to the shootout, and he is hospitalized with a bail set at an extraordinary $5.2 million. His next court appearance is scheduled for September 28.

Concerns have arisen regarding Rahami's legal representation since his arrest. Reports indicate that he has been without legal counsel, raising questions about whether he has been informed of his Miranda rights. This lack of legal support has led to further complications in the case, as lawmakers note that Rahami has not been cooperating with authorities.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch has indicated that Rahami is expected to be moved to Manhattan in the near future. However, federal prosecutors have displayed little urgency in facilitating this transfer, which has left many speculating about the timeline of his case. 

The Federal Defenders office has expressed interest in being appointed to represent Rahami, but prosecutors argue that it is premature to take such action until he appears in court. This situation has created a legal limbo for Rahami, as he awaits further developments in his case.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the complexities surrounding Rahami's custody and charges continue to raise questions about the intersection of state and federal law. The upcoming court appearance on September 28 will be crucial in determining the next steps for Rahami and the handling of his case.

With the stakes high and the legal landscape shifting, attention will remain focused on how authorities navigate the challenges presented by Rahami's situation. As developments emerge, the implications for both state and federal jurisdictions will be closely monitored by legal experts and the public alike.",-21.0,-3.0,597.0,-1.05,-0.035175879396984924,465.0,-0.15,-0.0064516129032258064
Real_7-Webpage,Donald Trump's rise puts Ted Cruz in a bind,"Story highlights Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump earlier this year, but is under pressure to change his mind now

Cruz could face a primary challenge in 2018 from a fellow Republican

Washington (CNN) Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said.

JUST WATCHED Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife 01:51

On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them.""

Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

With less than two months remaining until Election Day, Senator Ted Cruz is facing increasing pressure to endorse Donald Trump, despite his initial reluctance to do so. Cruz, who was a prominent challenger during the GOP primary, has found himself in a precarious position as the Republican Party rallies behind Trump.

Rep. Trent Franks, a supporter of Cruz during the primary season, has publicly urged Cruz to back Trump, emphasizing that failing to do so could inadvertently assist Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Franks warned that a lack of support for Trump could pose a threat to the Constitution, highlighting the stakes of the upcoming election.

However, Cruz's supporters are advocating for him to maintain his opposition to endorsing Trump. They argue that doing so could alienate his own base, which remains wary of Trump’s candidacy. Prominent Cruz supporter Steve Deace articulated concerns that endorsing Trump would violate Cruz's personal principles regarding political endorsements.

As Trump’s poll numbers continue to rise, the urgency for Cruz to show support intensifies. Trump's backers are increasingly anxious that if Cruz fails to endorse him, he may be held responsible should Trump lose narrowly to Clinton. This looming possibility adds to the pressure on Cruz, who must navigate the intricate dynamics of party loyalty and his own political identity.

The coming weeks will be critical for Cruz as he weighs the implications of his endorsement—or lack thereof—on his future and the broader Republican agenda. The political landscape is shifting rapidly, and Cruz's decision could have lasting consequences for the GOP.",10.0,5.0,294.0,1.1111111111111112,0.034013605442176874,306.0,0.4166666666666667,0.016339869281045753

Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks.

The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe.

“Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.”

Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.”

“They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”

In a pointed tweet, Trump mocked Clinton's long-standing involvement in combating ISIS, suggesting that her new proposals are inadequate and merely an attempt to redirect attention from her previous failures as Secretary of State.

Real_71-Webpage,Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible',"Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.

Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.

Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""

On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""

""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.

A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.

""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.

Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.

Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.

This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.

Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.

Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.

Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.

On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.

Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""

Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.

""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.

Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.

Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.

All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.

On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.

""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.

A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.

Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""

Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.

Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.

Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.

In a dramatic turn of events in federal court, testimony has revealed a calculated effort by former Port Authority executives and staffers from Chris Christie’s administration to intentionally exacerbate traffic congestion during the controversial lane closures at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013. The revelations come from David Wildstein, a former director at the Port Authority, who is currently testifying as part of a plea deal after pleading guilty to conspiracy and civil rights violations.

Wildstein's testimony highlighted the political motivations behind the lane closures, particularly centering around the lack of support from Fort Lee's Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich, for Christie’s reelection campaign. Wildstein recounted a conversation where Bridget Kelly, Christie’s ex-deputy chief of staff, expressed her frustration over Sokolich’s refusal to endorse Christie. This sentiment reportedly led Wildstein to propose the closure of bridge access lanes as a means to apply political pressure on the mayor.

Sokolich, navigating the political landscape of a predominantly Democratic town, opted not to endorse Christie in order to maintain the support of his constituents. On August 13, 2013, Kelly sent an email to Wildstein suggesting the creation of “traffic problems in Fort Lee,” a proposal to which Wildstein readily agreed. This communication set the stage for a series of lane closures that would ultimately disrupt the daily lives of countless commuters.

Following the email exchange, a phone call confirmed that the lane closures would proceed without any advance notice to Fort Lee officials or the public. Wildstein coordinated the logistics of the closures with both Kelly and Bill Baroni, the former Port Authority deputy executive director. A policy of “radio silence” was established, which mandated that all inquiries regarding the lane closures be directed to Baroni’s office, effectively stifling any communication from concerned officials in Fort Lee.

According to Wildstein, the lack of prior notification was a deliberate strategy aimed at maximizing the impact on Fort Lee. He indicated that the timing of the closures was carefully considered, with the decision made to start on September 9, coinciding with the first day of school in Fort Lee. Initially, the plan was to close all three access lanes leading to the bridge, but Wildstein later modified this to two lanes due to concerns about potential accidents and safety issues.

On September 6, just days before the closures commenced, Wildstein informed the Port Authority staff about the impending lane closures, instructing them to keep the information confidential. Staff members were led to believe that the closures were part of a legitimate traffic study, further obscuring the true intentions behind the actions.

As the closures began on the first day, Wildstein took it upon himself to monitor the resulting traffic buildup. He maintained communication with Kelly throughout the day, relaying updates and expressing satisfaction with the outcomes. Despite receiving multiple inquiries from Fort Lee officials regarding the unusual traffic conditions, the enforced “radio silence” policy remained in effect, leaving local authorities in the dark about the situation.

Throughout his testimony, Wildstein characterized Baroni's role as primarily serving the interests of Christie’s administration, emphasizing a “one constituent rule” that prioritized the governor's political agenda over the needs of the community. This perspective sheds light on the motivations that drove the actions of those involved in the scandal.

Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni are currently facing conspiracy and fraud charges related to the Bridgegate scandal. Both have indicated plans to testify in their defense, suggesting that the unfolding trial may reveal even more about the inner workings of the Christie administration and its approach to political maneuvering.

The testimony provided by Wildstein paints a troubling picture of the lengths to which certain officials were willing to go to achieve political goals. The intentional disruption of traffic, which affected thousands of commuters and residents in Fort Lee, raises serious ethical questions about the intersection of politics and public service.

As the trial continues, the implications of Wildstein's testimony could have far-reaching consequences for those involved, as well as for the broader political landscape in New Jersey. The case has drawn significant attention, not only for its political ramifications but also for the ethical considerations it raises regarding the conduct of public officials.

The Bridgegate scandal has become a focal point in discussions about accountability and transparency in government, highlighting the need for a system that prioritizes the well-being of constituents over political ambitions. As the court proceedings unfold, the public remains keenly interested in the outcomes and the potential repercussions for those implicated in this controversial chapter of New Jersey politics.

In conclusion, the testimony in federal court has shed new light on the motivations behind the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, revealing a calculated effort to manipulate traffic patterns for political gain. With Wildstein's revelations serving as a critical piece of evidence, the ongoing trial is poised to explore the depths of the scandal and its implications for those involved, as well as the broader political landscape in New Jersey. As the case progresses, it will be essential to monitor the developments and the responses from both the prosecution and the defense, as they navigate the complexities of this high-profile legal battle.",9.0,-24.0,1009.0,0.225,0.008919722497522299,975.0,-0.75,-0.024615384615384615

It's living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state

(CNN) Florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the November election.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched.

The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.

""So if I had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin,"" says USF Tampa political scientist Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor at the University of South Florida. ""We're to the point where anything is possible. This is just one of those kind of elections.""

All eyes are on central Florida's I-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. The area stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics.

As the November election approaches, Florida has solidified its status as a pivotal swing state, with recent polling indicating a tight race between the two leading candidates. A CNN/ORC poll reveals that Donald Trump is narrowly leading Hillary Clinton among likely voters, with Trump garnering 47% support compared to Clinton's 44%. The poll carries a margin of error of 3.5%, underscoring the competitive nature of the race.

Clinton's earlier advantage following the Democratic convention has notably diminished, creating a sense of uncertainty about the election outcome in the state. Political experts, including Susan MacManus, a prominent political scientist, emphasize that the race is too close to call, comparing the situation to flipping a coin.

Particularly significant is the I-4 corridor in central Florida, which is recognized for its diverse political and demographic landscape. This region is expected to play a crucial role in determining the election results, as candidates vie for support from a varied electorate. With both parties keenly aware of Florida's importance, the race is set to intensify in the coming weeks, making every vote count in this critical battleground state.",6.0,17.0,227.0,0.6,0.02643171806167401,224.0,2.125,0.07589285714285714
Real_74-Webpage,HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night’s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Here’s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday’s debate? — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet’s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

There’s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night’s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins aren’t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

@HuffingtonPost someone’s upset that #Trumpwins — Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? — Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn’t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate – except for the little watched @CNN poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, “Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN’s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.” They actually looks like they’re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, public opinion appears sharply divided, with a significant CNN/ORC poll indicating that 62% of respondents believed Hillary Clinton emerged victorious. This statistic contrasts starkly with numerous online polls that suggest Donald Trump won by a substantial margin, raising questions about the reliability of these digital surveys.

The discrepancy between traditional polling and online polling has garnered attention from various media outlets, including The Huffington Post, which has cast doubt on the accuracy of online polls as a true reflection of public sentiment. Critics argue that online polls can be easily manipulated, resulting in skewed results that often reflect the biases of the audience associated with the platform hosting the poll.

Evidence has surfaced suggesting that supporters of Donald Trump, particularly those active on platforms such as 4chan and Reddit, have been involved in manipulating online poll outcomes. This manipulation has led to inflated perceptions of Trump's debate performance, prompting a wave of frustration among his supporters when confronted with the more traditional polling data that favors Clinton.

In the midst of this polling controversy, Donald Trump took to social media to assert his dominance in the debate. He claimed victory in all polls except for the CNN survey, highlighting the #TrumpWon trend on Twitter as a testament to his supporters' enthusiasm and belief in his performance. Trump also shared an article from the Daily Mail, which suggested that many snap polls conducted immediately after the debate favored him, even as the CNN poll clearly indicated a Clinton win.

The conflicting narratives surrounding the debate results illustrate the complexities of gauging public opinion in the digital age. While traditional polls like the CNN/ORC survey offer a more structured approach to measuring voter sentiment, online polls often lack the same level of rigor and can be susceptible to manipulation by organized groups.

As the debate fallout continues, it is clear that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that Hillary Clinton won the debate. The reliance on traditional polling methods, which are generally viewed as more reliable, aligns with the majority opinion reflected in the CNN poll. Meanwhile, the online polls, which have been criticized for their susceptibility to bias and manipulation, present a contrasting narrative that may not accurately represent the broader public sentiment.

This division in polling results not only highlights the challenges of understanding public opinion in the current political landscape but also underscores the importance of critically evaluating the sources and methodologies behind polling data. As the election cycle progresses, voters and analysts alike will need to remain vigilant in discerning the validity of the information presented to them, particularly as social media continues to play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse.

In conclusion, while Donald Trump and his supporters may assert their victory in various online polls, the preponderance of evidence suggests that Hillary Clinton won the debate, as reflected in traditional polling methods. As the political climate evolves, it remains essential for voters to engage with credible sources of information and to approach online polling with a discerning eye.",35.0,34.0,556.0,1.75,0.06294964028776978,572.0,1.8888888888888888,0.05944055944055944
Real_75-Webpage,Tim Kaine on Libertarian ticket: 'Everybody knows they're not going to win',"Story highlights Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine says third-party Libertarian candidates will lose

He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson

(CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose.

""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week.

Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history.

""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. It may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. That's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history.""

Real_76-Webpage,Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s Vice President Joe Biden.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday’s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

“This is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?”

Adding:

“Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

“He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘You’re fired.’ They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

“He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

“If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord… What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.”

And it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Watch Biden lay into Trump here:

PHILADELPHIA – Vice President Joe Biden took to the stage in Philadelphia on Wednesday to rally support for Hillary Clinton, delivering a passionate critique of Donald Trump’s recent comments during a presidential debate. Biden’s remarks focused on Trump’s controversial statements regarding the housing market, which he deemed troubling and indicative of a deeper moral disconnect.

During his speech, Biden questioned Trump’s assertion that he had benefited from the housing market's collapse, a failure that devastated countless American families. “How can anyone take pride in profiting from the misfortunes of others?” Biden asked, expressing disbelief at Trump’s apparent lack of empathy for the struggles faced by working-class families.

Biden's critique extended beyond the housing market, as he emphasized the importance of a moral center in leadership. He noted that past presidents, including those from the Republican Party, have upheld American values that prioritize the well-being of all citizens. “There’s a basic decency that has always been part of our leadership,” Biden said, contrasting it sharply with what he described as Trump’s absence of fundamental sensibilities and values that resonate with most American politicians.

One of the most pointed moments of Biden’s address came when he condemned Trump’s pride in not paying taxes. “It’s simply unfair,” Biden asserted, highlighting the burden placed on ordinary Americans who diligently fulfill their tax obligations. He expressed anger over Trump’s comments, urging the audience to recognize the struggles faced by working-class families who often feel overlooked and undervalued.

As the campaign for the presidency heats up, Biden reiterated his belief that the choice in the upcoming election is clear. “We need a leader who understands the challenges of everyday Americans and will fight for them,” he declared, firmly endorsing Clinton as the candidate who embodies those values. “Hillary Clinton should be the next president,” he concluded, rallying his supporters to mobilize for the election.

The Vice President’s remarks reflect a broader strategy within the Clinton campaign to highlight the stark differences between her vision for America and Trump’s approach. By focusing on issues that resonate with working-class voters, Biden aims to galvanize support for Clinton and emphasize the importance of choosing a leader who prioritizes fairness and empathy.

As the election approaches, Biden’s passionate defense of Clinton and critique of Trump’s values may play a crucial role in shaping voter sentiment. With the stakes higher than ever, both candidates are expected to ramp up their efforts to connect with the American electorate, making the upcoming weeks pivotal in the race for the presidency.",3.0,-8.0,496.0,0.17647058823529413,0.006048387096774193,516.0,-0.47058823529411764,-0.015503875968992248

At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday.

The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.

Story Continued Below

The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.

The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.

""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""

In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.

“This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

In a startling revelation, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) inspector general has reported that 858 individuals who were ordered for deportation were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship. This significant error has raised concerns about the integrity of the naturalization process and the systems in place to vet applicants.

The citizenship errors were attributed to incomplete fingerprint records in both the DHS and FBI databases. The inspector general's report highlighted that these incomplete records primarily stemmed from the failure to fully digitize paper fingerprint cards and a lack of collaboration in sharing fingerprint data from immigration enforcement with the FBI. This oversight has resulted in a gap in the vetting process, allowing individuals who should not have been granted citizenship to receive it.

Importantly, the report clarified that those who were granted citizenship were classified as ""potentially"" ineligible, indicating that not all individuals received citizenship incorrectly. However, the implications of this finding are significant, particularly in light of the national conversation surrounding immigration and naturalization processes.

In response to the findings, the DHS is actively addressing the issues related to incomplete fingerprint records. Preliminary reviews conducted by the department show that many applicants with incomplete records were denied naturalization. Furthermore, some cases are currently under criminal investigation or have entered denaturalization proceedings, reflecting the serious nature of the errors.

Among the most concerning aspects of the report is the revelation that at least three individuals, who had previously been deported, were granted citizenship and subsequently obtained security clearances for sensitive positions at airports and maritime facilities. The credentials of these individuals have since been revoked, raising alarms about the potential security risks associated with the citizenship errors.

Inspector General John Roth emphasized the critical need for access to comprehensive fingerprint records to prevent fraud in the naturalization process. The lack of access to complete data not only undermines the integrity of the citizenship process but also poses challenges for national security and public safety.

The issue of vetting immigrants has garnered significant attention, particularly from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has made immigration reform a cornerstone of his campaign. Trump's focus on stringent vetting processes aligns with the concerns raised in the inspector general's report, highlighting the need for robust measures to ensure that only eligible individuals are granted citizenship.

As the DHS works to rectify the issues surrounding the incomplete fingerprint records, the implications of this report are likely to resonate throughout the political landscape. The findings may prompt renewed discussions about immigration policy, naturalization processes, and the importance of thorough vetting for all applicants seeking U.S. citizenship.

In conclusion, the inspector general's report serves as a critical reminder of the complexities involved in the naturalization process and the necessity for accurate and complete data to ensure the integrity of citizenship grants. As the DHS continues to address these issues, the focus on immigration and citizenship is expected to remain a prominent topic in the national discourse.",-16.0,-12.0,559.0,-1.0,-0.028622540250447227,553.0,-0.6,-0.0216998191681736
Real_78-Webpage,Insiders: The heat is on Hillary,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.

Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.

Story Continued Below

That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.

“She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,” said a Nevada Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.”

“The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,” a New Hampshire Democrat added. “Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.”

One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.

“Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the Ohio Democrat. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.”

Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.

“Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an Ohio Republican. “Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.”

“She has to stop [Trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a Virginia Republican. “All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.”

Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans — most pointed to the GOP nominee’s volatile personality.

“Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,” said a Michigan Republican. “The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.”

“The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?” added a Michigan Democrat. “Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?”

Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:

Most insiders expect Clinton to “win” the debate.

Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

“Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,” said an Iowa Republican.

“[Clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a New Hampshire Democrat.

But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.

“The press wants Trump to win,” said a Florida Democrat. “Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.”

Some Republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction.

“The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,” a Virginia Republican said. “But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.”

Insiders think the debate will matter.

Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.

Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle.

“Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a Michigan Democrat predicted. “The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.”

The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact.

“Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.”

But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump’s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.

“If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an Iowa Republican. “If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.”

Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.

“We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,” an Iowa Republican said. “Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.”

Added a Florida Democrat: “Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.”

As the political landscape heats up in anticipation of the upcoming debate, Hillary Clinton finds herself under an intensified spotlight. Insiders from both the Democratic and Republican parties suggest that the stakes are particularly high for the former Secretary of State, especially given her extensive experience in politics and the recent tightening of polls that have left many on edge. 

Recent surveys reveal that a significant majority of voters from both parties perceive Clinton as facing more pressure than her opponent, Donald Trump. According to the latest data, 69% of Democrats and 74% of Republicans believe that Clinton is under a greater burden to perform well during the debate. This sentiment underscores the high expectations that have been set for her, particularly as she seeks to regain momentum in a race that has become increasingly competitive.

Democrats are expressing palpable concern regarding the low expectations that have been established for Trump, who many perceive as lacking the necessary experience on key issues. This discrepancy in expectations has led to discussions about a potential double standard when it comes to evaluating the candidates' performances. Clinton, with her years of political experience, is expected to meet high standards, while Trump appears to be afforded a different level of scrutiny.

Republican insiders acknowledge the heightened scrutiny surrounding Clinton, attributing it to her urgent need to reverse declining poll numbers. The pressure is on for her to deliver a strong performance that can reassure her base and sway undecided voters. In contrast, opinions on whether Trump is under pressure are mixed. While some insiders argue that he must manage his temper and project a more presidential demeanor, others believe that he is not facing the same level of scrutiny as Clinton.

Despite the differing opinions on pressure, a majority of insiders predict that Clinton will emerge victorious from the debate. A striking 76% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans foresee her winning the face-off, indicating a strong belief in her capabilities to articulate her positions effectively. This optimism among Democrats is juxtaposed with a level of skepticism regarding media bias, as some express concerns that the media may favor Trump, while a segment of Republicans believes that the media will tilt in favor of Clinton.

The debate is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the race, with insiders agreeing that it will have a significant impact on the overall trajectory of the campaign. Many expect that the outcome could generate crucial momentum for one of the candidates, potentially influencing voter perceptions in the days following the event. 

Among Democrats, 66% believe that Clinton will gain an advantage from the debate, while 52% of Republicans think it will benefit Trump. This division reflects the polarized nature of the current political climate, where opinions on the candidates are often sharply divided along party lines. 

However, some insiders remain skeptical about the debate's lasting effect on the race. Given the current political climate and the intense polarization among voters, there are doubts about whether the debate will significantly alter the landscape or sway the opinions of entrenched supporters on either side.

As the debate draws near, all eyes will be on Clinton and Trump, with the nation poised to witness a confrontation that could very well shape the future of the campaign. The pressure is on for both candidates, but particularly for Clinton, who must navigate the expectations and scrutiny that come with her extensive political background while striving to connect with voters in a deeply divided electorate.",43.0,16.0,2576.0,0.8431372549019608,0.016692546583850932,653.0,0.6956521739130435,0.02450229709035222
Real_79-Webpage,Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

In a recent commentary, Frank Wilkenmeyer has taken aim at Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump for their behavior on social media, particularly in the context of their reactions to national issues. Wilkenmeyer’s critique draws attention to how the Trump brothers often provide a wealth of material for mockery, particularly in light of Eric Trump’s recent boast about being featured in a crossword puzzle. This self-admiration has not gone unnoticed, as it exemplifies a tendency among the Trump siblings to engage in self-promotion rather than substantive discourse.

The article delves deeper into a broader discussion surrounding patriotism, particularly in the wake of Colin Kaepernick's protests during the National Anthem. Kaepernick's actions have sparked significant controversy, drawing sharp criticism from conservatives, including Donald Trump Jr., who have accused him of being unpatriotic and disrespecting the troops. This reaction has been emblematic of a larger narrative among conservatives, who often equate displays of patriotism with specific actions, such as standing during the National Anthem.

Conversely, those on the left have rallied to defend Kaepernick and other athletes' rights to protest, invoking the First Amendment as a cornerstone of American democracy. This clash of ideologies raises critical questions about what constitutes true patriotism. Wilkenmeyer suggests that the selective outrage displayed by conservatives highlights a hypocrisy in their understanding of constitutional rights. While they vehemently support the Second Amendment, their enthusiasm for the First Amendment appears to wane when it comes to expressions of dissent.

Wilkenmeyer argues that patriotism should not be measured by one’s willingness to participate in mandatory displays of nationalism, such as singing the National Anthem. Instead, he posits that genuine patriotism encompasses a broader spectrum of beliefs and actions, including the right to protest and express dissenting opinions. This perspective aligns with the Supreme Court's historical support for free speech rights, particularly in relation to protests and expressions that challenge the status quo.

The article underscores the importance of understanding the nuances of patriotism in a democratic society. Rather than viewing dissent as an affront to national pride, Wilkenmeyer advocates for a more inclusive definition of what it means to be patriotic. He emphasizes that the ability to express differing opinions and engage in peaceful protest is, in fact, a hallmark of a healthy democracy.

As the debate around Kaepernick’s protest continues to unfold, it serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding patriotism in America. The reactions from figures like Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reflect a narrow interpretation of what it means to honor one’s country. In contrast, voices like Wilkenmeyer’s call for a re-examination of these definitions, urging society to embrace a more expansive view of patriotism that allows for dissent and dialogue.

In conclusion, Wilkenmeyer’s critique of the Trump brothers serves as a lens through which to examine broader themes of patriotism, free speech, and the rights of individuals to express their beliefs. By highlighting the contradictions in conservative rhetoric, he invites readers to consider the true essence of patriotism in a nation built on the principles of freedom and expression. Ultimately, the ongoing discourse around Kaepernick's protest and the reactions it elicits will continue to shape the conversation about what it means to be a patriot in contemporary America.",-17.0,6.0,592.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.028716216216216218,617.0,0.2727272727272727,0.009724473257698542
Real_8-Webpage,More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump! – Eagle Rising,"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.

The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category.

Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.

Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.

Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.

Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”. Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said.

Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”

In a political landscape that has seen its fair share of twists and turns, Donald Trump is riding a wave of momentum that seems to be gaining strength with each passing day. Following a week that was already marked by notable achievements, recent developments have further cemented Trump's position in the race for the presidency. As various polls indicate a surge in support for the former president, Trump has also unveiled significant policy proposals aimed at addressing key issues facing American families.

Recent polling data paints a picture of a competitive race between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A Fox News Poll shows Trump leading Clinton by a narrow margin of 46% to 45%, while the LA Times/USC Poll takes it a step further, placing Trump at 47% against Clinton's 41%. In another survey conducted by Suffolk University, Trump holds a 3-point lead with 42% support compared to Clinton's 39%. Notably, a CNN/ORC Poll indicates that Trump is leading Clinton by 4 points in the crucial battleground state of Florida.

While Clinton continues to maintain a lead in key states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, the margins are narrowing, signaling a shift in voter sentiment. Additionally, states like Nevada and New Hampshire have transitioned into ""toss up"" status, indicating that the race is tightening as both candidates vie for support.

Amidst this backdrop of shifting political dynamics, Trump has introduced a childcare policy plan in Aston, Pennsylvania, which is spearheaded by his daughter, Ivanka Trump. This proposal aims to provide substantial support for families, particularly those who may not have access to employer-sponsored benefits. Among the key features of the plan is the offer of six weeks of paid maternity leave for mothers who lack such benefits, funded by closing gaps in unemployment insurance.

The childcare policy also includes provisions for low-income families, who will be eligible for childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), amounting to up to $1,200 per year. Furthermore, middle-class families will have the opportunity to fully deduct childcare expenses on their tax returns, easing the financial burden associated with raising children.

In a move that underscores a commitment to long-term financial planning, Trump’s proposal introduces Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs), which allow families to save for childcare expenses tax-free. Low-income families can benefit from a 50% match on the first $1,000 deposited in these accounts, providing an additional incentive for savings. Notably, DCSAs can also be utilized for elderly care expenses, broadening the scope of support for families managing various caregiving responsibilities.

In a further nod to the challenges faced by families, Trump has proposed a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, recognizing the significant contributions they make to their households and the economy.

In addition to his childcare policy announcement, Trump delivered a speech to the Economic Club of New York, where he outlined his vision for economic growth and stability. The speech resonated with many business leaders and policymakers, reinforcing his commitment to fostering a robust economy.

Trump also made headlines with a recent appearance on The Dr. Oz Show, where he disclosed his medical records, revealing that he is in good health despite being slightly overweight. This disclosure comes at a time when concerns about Hillary Clinton's health have been a topic of discussion, allowing Trump to position himself as a candidate in good physical condition.

The former president's lighter side was showcased during his visit to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, where he allowed Fallon to ""mess up his hair,"" demonstrating his self-deprecating humor and ability to connect with audiences on a personal level. These appearances not only humanize Trump but also serve to engage younger voters who may be more inclined to connect with a candidate who can blend seriousness with levity.

In a strategic move to bolster his image, Trump also opened a new hotel in Washington, D.C., which has garnered endorsements from military officers and Medal of Honor recipients. This step not only expands his business portfolio but also reinforces his connection to the military community, a crucial demographic for any presidential candidate.

Amidst these developments, Trump addressed the long-standing ""birther issue,"" stating that he has put the matter to rest by confirming President Obama's birthplace. This acknowledgment may serve to quell lingering controversies while allowing Trump to refocus the narrative on his policy proposals and campaign agenda.

As the week draws to a close, it is clear that Donald Trump has experienced another ""amazing week,"" characterized by strategic policy announcements, engaging media appearances, and a surge in polling support. With each passing day, he continues to disregard political correctness, opting instead for a direct approach that resonates with a significant portion of the electorate.

As the election season heats up, Trump's ability to maintain this momentum will be critical. With new initiatives aimed at addressing the needs of American families and a growing base of support, he appears poised to challenge Clinton effectively in the months ahead. The unfolding political landscape promises to be dynamic, and as both candidates ramp up their campaigns, the American public will be watching closely to see how these developments shape the future of the race for the presidency.",59.0,76.0,1240.0,1.2291666666666667,0.04758064516129032,993.0,2.303030303030303,0.07653575025176233
Real_80-Webpage,Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground,"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.

Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.

He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.

Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.

Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.

Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.

These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.

Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.

""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.

Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.

Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump.

""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.

Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.

Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""

The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.

Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.

TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.

This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.

""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""

Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""

Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""

""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""

This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.

Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.

In a notable shift in media strategy, former President Donald Trump has increasingly aligned himself with Fox News, eschewing appearances on major networks that may present tougher questioning. This pivot has raised eyebrows among journalists and political analysts, who suggest that Trump’s approach is designed to solidify his base while limiting exposure to critical scrutiny.

Trump’s frequent appearances on Fox programs, such as ""Fox & Friends"" and ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" have become a staple of his media engagements. He is also slated to participate in upcoming town halls with prominent Fox host Sean Hannity, further solidifying this partnership. This strategy appears to be a calculated move to rally his supporters by providing them with a steady diet of content that aligns with their views, while simultaneously avoiding the challenging inquiries that often characterize interviews on other networks.

While Trump’s surrogates have claimed that he is more accessible than his political rival, Hillary Clinton, this assertion is increasingly being called into question. Critics point out that Clinton has conducted multiple press conferences in recent weeks, showcasing her willingness to engage with the media. In stark contrast, Trump has not held a press conference since July, marking over 50 days without direct interaction with reporters. This prolonged absence has not gone unnoticed, drawing significant attention from the media who are eager for his insights and responses to current events.

Trump's recent media appearances have included shows like ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" both of which are not traditional news platforms. These venues allow him to project a more controlled image, free from the rigorous questioning that often accompanies political news segments. His last substantive interview with a major publication occurred just last week with The Washington Post, while a prior discussion with the New York Times took place about a month ago. However, this limited engagement with the traditional press raises questions about his commitment to transparency and accountability.

Notably, Trump has not appeared on CNN since late August, where he faced pointed questions regarding his immigration policies. His last appearance on NBC was on September 7, and he has largely steered clear of ABC and CBS, except for a brief interview on September 6 and a ""60 Minutes"" segment aired in July. This pattern indicates a clear preference for Fox News, which has developed a reputation for providing a more favorable platform for Trump and his messaging.

As TV networks express a desire for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton, the former president's reputation for accessibility appears to be waning. Once known for his frequent interactions with the press, Trump’s current approach seems to indicate a strategic retreat from environments where he might face tougher questions. Experts speculate that this shift is a protective measure, allowing him to maintain control over his narrative and avoid potential pitfalls that could arise from unscripted exchanges.

The relationship between Trump and Fox News, particularly with Hannity, is a focal point of his media strategy. Critics have noted that this partnership enables Trump to bypass critical journalism in favor of a more congenial atmosphere. A forthcoming town hall with Hannity is expected to address issues affecting African-American communities, despite the fact that viewership from that demographic on Fox News has been notably low. This raises further questions about the efficacy of such engagements and whether they will resonate with the intended audience.

As Trump continues to navigate the political landscape, his media strategy reflects a broader trend among politicians seeking to control their messaging in an era of polarized media. By favoring Fox News and avoiding traditional press conferences, Trump is likely aiming to bolster his support base while minimizing exposure to challenging narratives. This tactic, however, has not only frustrated journalists but also sparked a broader debate about the importance of media accessibility and accountability in democratic discourse.

In conclusion, Donald Trump's evolving media strategy underscores a significant shift in how he interacts with the press and the public. By prioritizing appearances on Fox News and limiting his engagement with other major networks, Trump is crafting a narrative that caters to his supporters while sidestepping critical questioning. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of this strategy will likely shape the discourse surrounding his candidacy and the broader electoral process.",15.0,26.0,918.0,0.35714285714285715,0.016339869281045753,816.0,0.896551724137931,0.031862745098039214

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.""

Pence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.

The campaign has accused the publication of containing ""inaccuracies and omissions"" in its reporting concerning the Trump Foundation.

During the interview, Pence echoed the campaign's concerns, asserting that Donald Trump allegedly utilized $258,000 from his charitable foundation to resolve legal matters. While he highlighted the presence of ""factual errors"" in the Post's reporting, Pence refrained from providing specific examples to support his claims.

Real_82-Webpage,Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.

The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

New Jersey State Police

A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.

Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.

One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.

Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

New Jersey State Police

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.

""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""

Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.

Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

New Jersey State Police

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.

Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.

Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.

A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, was apprehended in Linden, New Jersey, in connection with a series of explosive devices discovered in New York City and New Jersey. His capture follows an extensive investigation into the incidents that have raised concerns about public safety and national security.

Rahami's family immigrated to the United States in 1995, as stated by his father, although initial reports indicated the year as 2000. The family settled in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Rahami grew up alongside as many as seven siblings, according to court records. He attended Edison High School, where he was characterized by former classmates as a quiet individual with a sense of humor.

After completing high school, Rahami enrolled at Middlesex County College from 2010 to 2012, pursuing an associate's degree in criminal justice. However, he did not graduate from the program. During this time, he worked at the family-owned fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, where he earned a reputation as a friendly presence among local customers.

Despite this seemingly ordinary life, Rahami's family has faced their share of legal challenges. In 2011, they sued local police for alleged harassment, a case that was ultimately dismissed in 2012. These legal troubles may have contributed to a complex background that investigators are now examining in relation to Rahami's recent activities.

Authorities are particularly interested in Rahami's travel history, including a significant trip to Pakistan that spanned from April 2013 to March 2014. This period has raised questions about his potential connections to extremist groups, as investigators delve into the details of his travels and any influences that may have shaped his actions.

Rahami's criminal record includes an arrest in August 2014 for allegedly stabbing someone, although he was not indicted in that case. This incident marks a troubling pattern of behavior that has now culminated in his recent charges related to the explosive devices.

During his capture, Rahami was involved in a shootout with police, resulting in him being shot at least once. He was subsequently taken to a hospital for treatment. Following his apprehension, Rahami has been uncooperative with investigators, refusing to provide his name, which has complicated the ongoing investigation into his activities.

As of now, Rahami faces multiple serious charges, including five counts of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. His bail has been set at a staggering $5.2 million, reflecting the severity of the allegations against him.

In a development that may aid U.S. authorities, the Afghan government has expressed its willingness to assist in the investigation regarding Rahami. This cooperation could prove crucial in uncovering any potential links he may have with groups or individuals in Afghanistan, as well as providing further context to his background and motivations.

As the investigation continues, the implications of Rahami's actions have sparked discussions about security measures in urban areas, particularly in light of the recent explosive devices that have caused alarm among residents. The events surrounding Rahami's capture serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement in preventing acts of violence and ensuring public safety.

Community members in Elizabeth have expressed shock at the news of Rahami's involvement in such serious criminal activity, particularly given his previous reputation as a friendly figure in the neighborhood. The contrast between his past demeanor and the gravity of the charges against him has left many questioning how someone they once knew could become embroiled in such dangerous actions.

As authorities work to piece together the full extent of Rahami's activities and motivations, the case serves as a focal point for broader discussions about immigration, integration, and the complexities of identity in contemporary America.

Real_83-Webpage,Trump’s puzzling pitch to black voters,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

Story Continued Below

The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

“The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

“We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.

But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night.

“I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”

Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach.

“I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?”

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

“Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

“I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.”

Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.”

“The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.”

Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.

“They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”

In a bold move to connect with urban America, former President Donald Trump campaigned at a historically African-American church in Cleveland, Ohio, positioning himself as a candidate capable of addressing the pressing issues facing black communities. This event marked a significant outreach effort as Trump seeks to reshape his image and counter accusations of racism levied against him by Democrats, particularly his rival, Hillary Clinton.

During his appearance, Trump proposed the expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policies, a controversial law enforcement strategy that has drawn criticism for its association with racial profiling. The proposal has historically met with resistance from many black community leaders who argue that such policies disproportionately target African-Americans. Despite this, Trump endorsed the approach during a town hall meeting with conservative commentator Sean Hannity, citing its previous success in New York City as a model for reducing crime.

Trump's outreach to African-American voters is part of a broader strategy to bolster his support among minority communities, which has been notably low. His attempts to engage with black audiences come as part of a dual approach where he also addresses predominantly white audiences, emphasizing the struggles faced by black Americans. This duality reflects a calculated effort to appeal not only to African-American voters but also to moderate white voters who may be swayed by Trump's messages of law and order.

Flanked by key advisors including Vice President Mike Pence, attorney Michael Cohen, former presidential candidate Ben Carson, and former reality television star Omarosa Manigault, Trump made his case at the Cleveland event. The presence of such high-profile figures underscored the importance of this outreach effort. Notably, Trump was introduced by Don King, the former boxing promoter known for his controversial past. King praised Trump as a “gladiator” fighting against a political system that has historically oppressed minorities, framing the former president as a champion for change.

However, Trump's claims about the state of African-Americans’ situation drew criticism from civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis. Lewis challenged Trump's assertion that conditions for black Americans are worse than ever, citing the historical injustices that have shaped the current landscape. This exchange highlights the tension between Trump's narrative and the perspectives of those who have long fought for civil rights.

Despite Trump's attempts to engage with the African-American community, skepticism remains. Many in the community view his outreach as a strategic maneuver aimed at securing votes from moderate white constituents rather than a genuine commitment to addressing their concerns. This perception is compounded by Trump's history and the ongoing scrutiny of his policies and statements regarding race.

At the Cleveland event, Trump characterized himself as the “law and order” candidate, a label he has embraced throughout his campaign. He also commented on a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man, an incident that has reignited discussions about police violence and systemic racism in law enforcement. By addressing such sensitive topics, Trump aims to position himself as a leader who is willing to confront difficult issues, even as his proposed solutions remain contentious.

Cohen, who has been a staunch defender of Trump, addressed media accusations of racism, asserting that the former president views all individuals as part of the ""human race."" This statement reflects a broader narrative that Trump and his supporters have attempted to cultivate, one that seeks to distance him from allegations of racial insensitivity and to present him as a unifier.

Furthermore, Trump accused Democrats of neglecting African-American voters, claiming that they only seek their votes during election cycles, specifically every four years. This assertion plays into a larger narrative that positions Trump as an alternative to the Democratic Party, which he argues has failed to deliver tangible benefits to black communities.

As Trump continues his campaign efforts, the question remains whether his outreach will resonate with African-American voters or if it will be perceived as a superficial attempt to win support. With his approval ratings among black voters still low, the effectiveness of his strategies will be closely scrutinized as the election approaches.

The Cleveland event encapsulates the complexities of Trump's relationship with African-American voters and the ongoing challenges he faces in overcoming a legacy of racial controversy. As he seeks to redefine his image, the impact of his outreach efforts will be a key factor in determining his electoral success in the months to come.",-67.0,-5.0,1178.0,-1.8108108108108107,-0.056876061120543296,813.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.006150061500615006

Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged.

“If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.”

Story Continued Below

Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.”

Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.

But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.”

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.”

Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.

Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.

“I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.”

He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.

“I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.

Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently shared his thoughts on Donald Trump's acknowledgment of Barack Obama's birthplace, a topic that has sparked considerable debate over the years. Arpaio, known for his staunch immigration policies and his controversial investigation into Obama's birth certificate, noted that while Trump recognized Obama's birthplace, he did not explicitly declare the birth certificate legitimate.

In a statement that reflects his ongoing skepticism, Arpaio remarked that Trump's comments did not bother him. He suggested that Trump may possess information that he himself lacks, hinting at a potential depth to the issue that remains unexplored. This perspective aligns with Arpaio's long-standing position on the legitimacy of Obama's birth certificate, which he famously investigated in 2011.

Trump initially drew attention to the birther controversy, insinuating that Obama was not born in the United States, a claim that has faced significant criticism for its perceived racial undertones. Recently, under mounting pressure, Trump retracted his previous assertions regarding the birther issue, instead attributing the origin of the rumor to Hillary Clinton. This claim has been widely debunked by fact-checkers, further complicating Trump's relationship with the controversy.

Despite Trump's attempts to distance himself from the birther claims, Arpaio remains adamant that Obama's birth certificate is forged. He stated that his investigation into the document is still ongoing, although he refrained from presenting any specific evidence to support his assertions. Arpaio emphasized that his inquiry is centered on the validity of the document itself rather than Obama's actual birthplace, underscoring that his skepticism should not be interpreted as racially motivated.

In a candid admission, Arpaio acknowledged his uncertainty regarding Obama's birthplace, stating, ""I have no idea now where he was born."" This statement marks a notable shift in his previous assertions, reflecting a more ambiguous stance on a topic that has long defined his public persona.

Arpaio also clarified that he and Trump did not engage in discussions about the birth certificate issue prior to Trump's recent press conference. This detail suggests that while both figures have been intertwined in the birther narrative, their communications on the subject may not have been as direct as some might assume.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Arpaio's comments and Trump's retraction of his birther claims remain to be seen. The ongoing debate surrounding Obama's birth certificate, once a focal point of Trump's rise in politics, now serves as a contentious backdrop to discussions on race, legitimacy, and political accountability in America.

Arpaio's unwavering stance on the issue, combined with Trump's recent pivot, highlights the complexities of the birther controversy and its lasting impact on American political discourse. As both figures navigate their respective paths, the narrative surrounding Obama's birthplace remains a potent reminder of the intersection between race, politics, and public perception in the United States.",-9.0,-10.0,533.0,-0.5625,-0.016885553470919325,555.0,-0.5263157894736842,-0.018018018018018018
Real_85-Webpage,Barack Obama at Benjamin Netanyahu meeting: 'He is always very candid with us',"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month

His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office.

Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency.

""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us.""

That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January.

Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

In a significant diplomatic engagement, President Barack Obama convened a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss their often strained partnership. The meeting, which lasted 30 minutes, was focused on evaluating the prospects for peace in the region as Obama prepares to leave office.

During the meeting, Obama expressed his hopes for a deeper understanding of Israel's future challenges and opportunities. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a stable and secure Israel, reflecting his administration's commitment to the nation's security. This dialogue comes at a pivotal time, as the outgoing president aims to solidify U.S.-Israel relations for his successor.

The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been characterized by candid exchanges, with Netanyahu's straightforward approach sometimes clashing with U.S. policies. Notably, their differing views have been particularly evident in discussions surrounding the Iran nuclear agreement, which has been a contentious issue throughout Obama's presidency.

As the clock ticks down to the inauguration of a new president in January, this meeting is poised to be their last face-to-face consultation. Obama’s desire to strengthen ties with Israel despite personal tensions with Netanyahu underscores his commitment to the long-standing alliance, aiming to pave the way for a smoother transition for the incoming administration.

The outcome of this meeting may have lasting implications for U.S.-Israel relations, as both leaders seek to navigate the complexities of regional politics and security in a changing global landscape.",25.0,21.0,300.0,2.7777777777777777,0.08333333333333333,275.0,2.1,0.07636363636363637
Real_86-Webpage,McAuliffe hangs with Willie Nelson -- and his weed,"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana

Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert

(CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed.

It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!""

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is.

""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool.""

The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

Real_87-Webpage,The Mystery of Trump’s Man in Moscow: Carter Page,"In March, in a bold “Oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the Washington Post’s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, “I have quite a few more.” The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “Carter Page, PhD.”

Who?

Story Continued Below

Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.”

This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.

“What’s this guy’s name?” says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.

“I had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. “But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘Have you heard of this guy?’”

“Strangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,” Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. “It's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.”

Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.

This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. “I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.” As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?

Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (“I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’” says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump’s own campaign.

What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. “He’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,” says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia’s state oil giant. “People really respect him in this industry. He’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials—including Rosneft head Igor Sechin—during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.

Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at Gazprom,” the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in Russia” and an office “around the corner from Trump Tower.”

Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, “Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a “famous American economist” and “adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.”

All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in Trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.

But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to Page’s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.

So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?

***

I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page’s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.

This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.

OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn’t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive résumé.

Page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. “He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,” his bio reads. “He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.”

Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page’s tenure in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.

So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn’t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “I don’t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says Craig . “It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.”

When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page’s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, “I rolled my eyes at that one.” (He, too, said he hadn’t heard of Page until Trump’s announcement.)

Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?

Turns out, they did.

“His nickname was stranichkin,” from the Russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. “It really irritated our team,” Torchinsky told me over Skype. “We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. These guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” As for Page, “He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” Torchinsky says. “When you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.”

OK, harsh. But then I talked to Page’s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. “He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me.

Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says Aleksashenko.

When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” And, says Aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.”

Trump’s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says Aleksashenko.

***

For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,” he wrote. “Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (“Slave; Pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.

His speech in Moscow’s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “For the last 15 years, I’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak Russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: “We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.” Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.

Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. “He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “That blog post about the slaves. That’s just … strange,” says the Council member.

“He’s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. “You’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.”

I should’ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump’s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.

I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page’s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?

But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch’s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “No one let him into Gazprom,” Aleksashenko says. “He didn’t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller’s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.” Another of Page’s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page’s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year… I used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.”

But the meetings did provide him with something else. “Gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them.

After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father’s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from Trump Tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space.

“That’s Carter Page,” says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. “That’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. He’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.”

In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia’s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“I don’t know this person,” said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page’s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. “I give them money, I don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,” he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “Don’t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.”

“You are engaged in onanism,” said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. “It’s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It’s absurd.”

As for the FBI investigation, well, it’s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.” He added, “the story doesn't add up.” What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page’s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.”

***

I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?

“Who?” says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.

“He has no formal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.

Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks’s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?

One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.

One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump’s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,” Burt told me. “And I told him I’d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I’ve forgotten. He’s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?”

Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump’s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. “If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,” this person told me.

“I’m not answering your questions,” Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “Carter Page isn’t someone I’ve interacted with.” Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: “Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He’s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.”

***

Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“Who?” Maybe I wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.

“I don’t know about his Russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. “Every conversation I’ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” He went on. “I couldn’t name a project that I could connect Carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.”

“I don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but I think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.”

Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, “a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ‘I want to be part of the team,’” says the Trump adviser. And that’s how it happened. “He’s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ‘He’s an adviser.’ And now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.”

Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,” one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,” the Russia specialist recalls. “He didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.”

According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page’s trip to Russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.” But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “It’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America’s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It’s what’s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carré novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?”

This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “If Page using his status as ‘Trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: “Carter Page, Ph.D.” Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.

For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?

There doesn’t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,” Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.

In March of this year, former President Donald Trump made headlines when he unveiled a short list of foreign policy advisers, a move that was both strategic and scrutinized. Among those named was Carter Page, PhD, a figure whose credentials and affiliations have since sparked considerable debate and concern. As the founder of Global Energy Capital, Page has positioned himself as an expert in the energy sector, claiming extensive experience in Russia. However, the validity of these claims has come under fire, with many experts in both Russia and energy expressing unfamiliarity with his work and influence.

The announcement of Page's advisory role coincided with reports that U.S. intelligence agencies were investigating him for alleged ties to Russian leaders. This revelation added a layer of intrigue and concern, particularly given Trump’s own lack of established connections within Washington. The scrutiny over the expertise of his advisers has become a focal point of discussion, raising questions about the qualifications and motivations of those surrounding the former president.

As Page's name gained prominence following Trump's announcement, speculation about his potential influence within the campaign began to swirl. However, the nature of this influence remains ambiguous. Page has made several controversial statements over the years, including praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and openly criticizing U.S. foreign policy. Such remarks have not only drawn attention but have also led many to question his alignment with traditional U.S. diplomatic values.

In addition to his role at Global Energy Capital, Page has a background that includes a vice presidency at Merrill Lynch. Yet, even within this prestigious position, former colleagues have raised doubts about his competence and the impact he had during his tenure. This skepticism extends to his self-styled expertise in the energy sector, with many industry insiders expressing doubts about his claims and qualifications.

The ongoing investigations into Page's connections to Russian officials further complicate the narrative surrounding his involvement with the Trump campaign. As these inquiries unfold, the implications for U.S. national security remain unclear, leaving many to wonder about the potential consequences of Page's associations and the broader concerns of Russian influence in American politics.

In light of these developments, Page has been characterized by some as someone who is attempting to leverage his association with Trump for personal gain. This portrayal paints a picture of a questionable figure operating within a larger context of political uncertainty and foreign influence. As the investigations continue and the implications of his role become clearer, the questions surrounding Carter Page's actual influence and expertise remain pressing.

The intersection of Page's controversial statements, dubious claims, and ongoing investigations has created a complex narrative that challenges the credibility of Trump's foreign policy team. With concerns about Russian interference in U.S. politics at an all-time high, the scrutiny surrounding Page serves as a microcosm of the broader tensions that define this era in American political life.

As the story unfolds, it is essential to consider not only Page's qualifications but also the motivations of those who surround influential political figures. The implications of these relationships extend beyond individual careers, touching upon the integrity of U.S. foreign policy and the nation's security. The ongoing discourse surrounding Carter Page is emblematic of the challenges facing American democracy in a world where foreign influence is increasingly pervasive. 

In conclusion, Carter Page's rise to prominence as a foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump raises significant questions about expertise, influence, and the nature of political associations in contemporary America. As investigations continue and the narrative develops, the implications of Page's connections and statements will undoubtedly remain a topic of discussion and concern among policymakers, analysts, and the public alike.",27.0,-5.0,6589.0,0.12796208530805686,0.004097738655334649,700.0,-0.19230769230769232,-0.007142857142857143
Real_88-Webpage,It’s “Trump is HITLER” Month at the Washington Post – Eagle Rising,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post.

On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part,

(…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is.

Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

Six Day’s before Mr. Cohen, another columnist Shalom Auslander wrote, “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles…

The publication has reportedly assigned a substantial team of 20 reporters to investigate various aspects of Trump's activities and policies, raising questions about the motives behind such extensive coverage.

Columnists at The Washington Post have drawn sharp rebukes for making controversial comparisons between Trump and Adolf Hitler. Notably, Richard Cohen's recent column describes Trump as ""Hitlerian in his thinking,"" a statement that has sparked outrage despite Cohen's clarification that he does not consider Trump an anti-Semite. This particular description has fueled accusations of bias, especially since Cohen refrains from making similar comparisons regarding Hillary Clinton, further highlighting a perceived double standard in the publication's treatment of political figures.

Shalom Auslander, a writer who previously cautioned against equating Trump with Hitler, argues that such comparisons diminish the gravity of historical atrocities. He contends that reducing complex figures to simplistic labels undermines serious discourse.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.

They’re not laughing anymore.

Story Continued Below

Going into Monday night’s debate, Obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.

“I’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “I feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘Breaking Bad’ here. We’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.”

“There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,” said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.

Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He’s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare—support Democrats.

For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there’s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.

“We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. “But we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.”

Trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.

And the result: Trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama’s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.

Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.

“I don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, I don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.”

But they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama’s America.

“I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. “He’s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.”

For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “Trump has shattered that,” Vietor said. “He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. That’s a bad lesson for people to learn.”

According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton’s chances.

“I’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.

Not everyone’s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.

“He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.

And Democrats’ sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.

“The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,” said Earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.”

But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.

“I’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” Papa said, “than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”

As the 2016 presidential election looms closer, the political landscape in the United States has been dramatically reshaped by the emergence of Donald Trump as a dominant force within the Republican Party. Initially, aides to former President Barack Obama found humor in Trump's takeover of the GOP, viewing it as a chaotic spectacle that showcased the party's internal strife. However, as the election season progresses, those same aides are grappling with a growing anxiety about Trump's potential success at the ballot box.

The laughter that once accompanied Trump's antics has faded, replaced by a sobering realization: Trump may not merely represent a fringe group within the Republican Party, but rather a broader segment of the American populace. This shift in perception has raised concerns among Obama's current and former aides, who recognize the implications of a Trump-led GOP, particularly as polls indicate a tightening race between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In battleground states, the two candidates appear nearly tied, contradicting earlier expectations that Trump would falter under the weight of his controversial rhetoric and unorthodox campaign style.

Obama himself has expressed mixed feelings about the situation. On one hand, he finds some amusement in the Republican Party's missteps and the self-inflicted wounds that have characterized Trump's rise. On the other hand, he harbors frustration over his own inability to connect with certain voter demographics, particularly those who have rallied behind Trump. This disconnect serves as a stark reminder of the divisions that persist within American society—divisions that Obama, during his presidency, struggled to bridge.

The current political climate has prompted significant concern among Obama's aides regarding the normalization of extremist views, particularly the mainstreaming of racist rhetoric that has become a hallmark of Trump's campaign. The former president's team worries about the long-lasting impact this could have on American politics and the political process itself. Trump's unexpected fundraising success has only intensified these fears, as it signals a potent mobilization of resources behind a campaign that many believed would be short-lived.

Former aides have pushed back against the notion that Trump's rise is a direct reflection of Obama's legacy. While they acknowledge the challenges of the current political environment, they maintain that the economic recovery during Obama's presidency stands as evidence against the credibility of the Tea Party and its associated ideologies. The recovery, they argue, should serve as a counterpoint to the narrative that has fueled Trump's ascent.

Despite the anxiety surrounding Trump's potential victory, there is a sense of schadenfreude among some former aides regarding the GOP's internal struggles. The party's fracturing under Trump's leadership has provided a source of amusement, as they watch the chaos unfold from a distance. However, this amusement is tempered by a deeper concern: the desire for a functional opposition that can engage in meaningful negotiations on key issues. Obama and his team lament the lost opportunities for bipartisan cooperation that have arisen from the current political climate, which has been dominated by divisive rhetoric and extreme partisanship.

As the election approaches, the desire for genuine political competition becomes increasingly pronounced. Many within Obama's circle worry that legitimizing extremist views within the political landscape could have dire consequences for the future of American democracy. The hope is for a return to a political environment where diverse viewpoints can be debated and respected, rather than one where extremist ideologies are given a platform and normalized.

In conclusion, the rise of Donald Trump has elicited a complex range of emotions among Obama's aides, from initial amusement to deep-seated anxiety. As they navigate the uncertain waters of the 2016 election, they are left to ponder the implications of Trump's candidacy for the future of American politics. The divisions that have long characterized the political landscape are now more pronounced than ever, and the stakes have never been higher. As the nation approaches a critical juncture in its democratic process, the hope remains for a political discourse that fosters genuine competition and respect for differing viewpoints, rather than one that legitimizes extremism and division.",-9.0,1.0,1354.0,-0.24324324324324326,-0.0066469719350073855,771.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0012970168612191958

Real_90-Webpage,Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

“Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”

Adding:

“This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”

Chelsea then said:

“Stop telling women to smile. We don’t like that. It’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”

Going for Priebus’ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

“You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.”

And that’s exactly right.

This sentiment was notably echoed by comedian Chelsea Handler, who responded to RNC Chair Reince Priebus's criticism of Hillary Clinton for her demeanor during an NBC forum. 

Priebus suggested that Clinton should smile more, a remark that Handler quickly challenged on her Netflix show. She questioned Priebus's authority to dictate how a woman should express herself, emphasizing that such comments are not only belittling but also generally unwelcome. Handler pointed out that the expectation for women to smile can be seen as a ""deal breaker"" rather than an icebreaker, highlighting the broader implications of such societal norms.

Moreover, Handler noted that the context in which a smile is expected matters significantly. For instance, discussions on serious topics such as foreign policy and military matters do not inherently necessitate a smiling demeanor. This nuance is often overlooked in societal expectations, particularly when it comes to women in the public eye.

Handler humorously concluded her segment by suggesting that women will smile when Clinton triumphs over her health challenges and secures a victory against Trump in the upcoming election. This light-hearted remark underscores the ongoing conversation about women's representation and the pressures they face in both political and social arenas.

H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.”

Likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.

Story Continued Below

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.

But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump’s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?

1. Does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country?

Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump — who swooned after Clinton’s superb convention in Philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.

His resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.

The first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream.

This is not to suggest that Trump can’t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.

Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates — but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care.

The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. “When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.”

Stone argued that Trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.

Trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.

Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD’s Section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?

2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?

Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: “We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.”

That’s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: “For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “Article 12 of the Constitution.” The framers stopped at seven. “He was just listing out numbers,” said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. “I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.”

OK, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “Free Exercise” clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.

3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?

Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.

But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.

Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much).

More serious is the issue of Trump’s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns.

This isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.

4. What’s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there’s the matter of Trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In exposé after exposé, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.

The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.

5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.

But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.

Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary” in Trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.

But it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially George W. Bush’s claims about Iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read POLITICO’s comprehensive “Donald Trump’s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths” for a taste.)

In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “Clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…”

But getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. It’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.

As the political landscape shifted in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, the first presidential debate emerged as a pivotal moment for Donald Trump. This debate was not merely a formality; it was viewed as a crucial job interview for a candidate who had captured the nation’s attention but remained an opaque figure in many respects. With a campaign characterized by catchy one-liners and the allure of celebrity status, Trump faced the daunting task of proving his qualifications to the American electorate.

In the realm of political discourse, Trump’s campaign themes revolved around broad ideas such as immigration control, trade deals, and a critique of political correctness. While these topics resonated with many voters, there was a notable absence of detailed knowledge on key issues, raising concerns about his preparedness for the presidency. As the debate approached, it became increasingly clear that Trump needed to demonstrate not only his understanding of these issues but also his capacity to govern effectively.

Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, entered the debate with her own set of challenges. With a long political history and a reputation that had been scrutinized over the years, she had much to prove. The stakes were particularly high for Clinton as she sought to establish herself as a formidable opponent capable of standing up to Trump. In this high-pressure environment, both candidates were under the spotlight, and the debate would serve as a defining moment in their respective campaigns.

As the debate loomed closer, five critical questions emerged that encapsulated the concerns surrounding Trump’s candidacy:

1. **Does Trump possess the basic knowledge needed to run the country?** This question lingered in the minds of voters and analysts alike. Many were left wondering whether Trump had the foundational understanding required for the complexities of governance. His previous statements often hinted at a superficial grasp of intricate issues, prompting skepticism about his readiness for the highest office in the land.

2. **Does he understand and respect American Constitutional principles?** The Constitution serves as the bedrock of American democracy, and any candidate aspiring to the presidency must demonstrate a commitment to its principles. Critics were quick to point out instances where Trump’s rhetoric seemed at odds with constitutional values, raising alarms about his potential approach to governance.

3. **Why won't he answer questions about his businesses and debts?** Transparency is a cornerstone of public trust, and Trump’s reluctance to address inquiries regarding his personal finances and business dealings fueled speculation. Voters were left to wonder what he might be hiding, and how these undisclosed matters could affect his decision-making as president.

4. **What is the status of his charitable foundation?** Questions surrounding the legitimacy and operations of Trump’s charitable foundation added another layer of scrutiny. Voters sought clarity on how funds were utilized and whether the foundation operated in accordance with its stated mission. The lack of transparency in this area raised further concerns about accountability.

5. **Why does he frequently lie or misrepresent facts?** A troubling pattern emerged in Trump’s public statements, where inaccuracies and exaggerations became a hallmark of his communication style. This tendency to distort the truth raised significant concerns about his integrity and the potential implications for public trust in leadership.

Despite these pressing questions, Trump’s popularity, while low nationally, began to gain traction in key battleground states. His ability to connect with certain demographics and tap into the frustrations of voters who felt unheard by the political establishment played a crucial role in his campaign’s momentum. However, critics remained steadfast in their belief that Trump’s lack of intellectual curiosity and understanding of complex issues could severely hinder his capacity to govern effectively.

Moreover, Trump’s approach to media and the legal threats he faced raised additional concerns about his respect for press freedoms. In an era where the media plays a vital role in holding public officials accountable, Trump’s contentious relationship with journalists and his frequent attacks on the press prompted fears about the implications for a free and independent media landscape.

As the debate approached, the questions surrounding Trump’s personal finances and charitable contributions became increasingly essential for transparency. Voters were eager for answers that could illuminate his character and intentions, particularly in an election where trust and integrity were at the forefront of public discourse.

The stakes were high, and the outcome of the debate would undoubtedly influence public perception of both candidates. For Trump, it was an opportunity to dispel doubts and showcase his qualifications for the presidency. For Clinton, it was a chance to solidify her position as a capable leader in the face of a formidable opponent.

Ultimately, the debate would serve as a critical juncture in the election cycle, with the potential to shape the narrative leading up to November. As the nation watched, the emphasis on honesty and factual accuracy would remain paramount in fostering public trust in leadership. The questions posed to Trump were not merely inquiries; they represented the hopes and concerns of a nation seeking clarity in uncertain times. The debate would not only test the candidates but also reflect the values and priorities of the American electorate as they prepared to make a monumental decision.",18.0,40.0,2547.0,0.21686746987951808,0.007067137809187279,1005.0,0.8695652173913043,0.03980099502487562
