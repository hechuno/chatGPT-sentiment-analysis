Real_1-Webpage,Another Terrorist Attack in NYC…Why Are we STILL Being Politically Correct – Eagle Rising,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

On September 17, 2022, a significant explosion rocked West 23rd Street in Chelsea, Manhattan, injuring 29 individuals and leading to extensive property damage. Fortunately, no fatalities were reported in the aftermath of this alarming incident. The explosion was attributed to a homemade bomb that had been placed in a dumpster, marking a troubling event in an area known for its vibrant community and bustling atmosphere.

In the wake of the Chelsea explosion, authorities discovered a second device, described as a ""pressure cooker,"" on West 27th Street. The presence of two explosive devices within such proximity raised immediate concerns regarding the safety of the public and the potential for further attacks.

All those injured in the Chelsea explosion were released from the hospital by Sunday morning, bringing some relief to the community as they began to process the shocking events. However, the incident has drawn attention to a broader issue of terrorism, particularly following a similar explosion that occurred in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. In that incident, a bomb detonated near a charity race but, thankfully, resulted in no casualties. Law enforcement officials have since linked the explosives from both New York and New Jersey to the same individual, raising fears about the motivations and plans of the perpetrator.

The Chelsea explosion has intensified discussions surrounding the growing concern over terrorism, especially in light of recent global incidents that have put communities on high alert. The challenge of addressing these threats is compounded by the complexities of political correctness, which often complicates law enforcement's ability to respond effectively to potential threats. 

In response to the incident, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio stated that there was no specific threat from any terror organization, characterizing the explosion as an ""intentional act."" This assertion aimed to reassure the public while acknowledging the deliberate nature of the attack. Meanwhile, Police Commissioner James O’Neill ruled out the possibility of a natural gas leak as the cause of the explosion, further solidifying the belief that the event was a targeted act of violence.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also addressed the situation, acknowledging the explosion as an act of terrorism. However, he emphasized the importance of clarity in defining terrorism, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the various factors that contribute to such acts. This call for clarity reflects a growing recognition that the term ""terrorism"" encompasses a wide range of motivations and actions, necessitating a comprehensive approach to prevention and response.

The explosion prompted reactions from prominent political figures, including presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Clinton emphasized the importance of supporting first responders, acknowledging their critical role in managing the aftermath of such incidents. In contrast, Trump called for a tougher stance on terrorism, advocating for stronger measures to protect citizens from potential threats. These differing responses illustrate the polarized nature of the conversation surrounding terrorism and the varying approaches proposed by political leaders.

The author of this article stresses the urgent need for strong leadership to protect citizens from the ever-present threat of terrorism. The vulnerability of soft targets in the United States has become a focal point of concern, as these locations often present opportunities for individuals with malicious intent to cause harm. The Chelsea explosion serves as a stark reminder of the precarious nature of public safety in urban environments, where large gatherings and open spaces can be exploited by those seeking to instill fear and chaos.

As the investigation into the Chelsea explosion continues, the community remains on edge, grappling with the implications of this act of violence. The interconnectedness of recent events in New York and New Jersey underscores the importance of collaboration between law enforcement agencies at all levels, as they work to unravel the motivations behind these attacks and prevent future incidents.

In conclusion, the explosion in Chelsea has sparked a renewed dialogue about the nature of terrorism and the challenges faced by authorities in addressing this complex issue. As the nation reflects on the implications of such acts, the need for vigilance, strong leadership, and a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to terrorism has never been more critical. The safety of the public hangs in the balance, and it is imperative that leaders rise to the occasion to safeguard their communities against the threats that loom in an increasingly unpredictable world.",-43.0,-5.0,930.0,-1.2285714285714286,-0.046236559139784944,811.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.006165228113440197
Real_10-Webpage,"Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests","Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.

""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.

The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.

""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""

He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.

""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""

But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.

Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.

During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""

Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.

Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.

""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.

In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",http://abcn.ws/2d4lNn9,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg,"More Candace,Adam Kelsey,Abc News,More Adam",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437,"{""fb_title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@adam_kels"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-22"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-22"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-22 14:33:00"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh""}","- Protests erupted in North Carolina following the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man.

In a tragic incident that has reignited discussions around police violence and racial injustice, protests erupted in North Carolina following the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man. The protests have drawn attention to the ongoing concerns about the treatment of African-Americans by law enforcement, reigniting a national conversation about race relations in the United States.

In the wake of the unrest, President Donald Trump addressed the situation during a speech at the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh. He attributed some of the unrest to the impact of drugs, suggesting that substance abuse plays a role in the violence and chaos that has unfolded in various cities. While he condemned the violence associated with the protests, Trump called for national unity, emphasizing the importance of controlling cities to maintain order and safety.

During his remarks, Trump recognized the right to peaceful protest, a fundamental aspect of American democracy. However, he was quick to condemn the violent disruptions that threaten public safety, reiterating his stance that law enforcement must be supported in their efforts to maintain order. His comments reflect a broader narrative that seeks to balance the need for social justice with the necessity of public safety.

In his speech, Trump praised law enforcement, calling for better training and accountability for police officers. He acknowledged the difficult job that police face but did not address the pattern of violence against African-Americans by police, a primary concern for many of the protesters. This omission has drawn criticism from activists who feel that the administration's response does not adequately recognize the systemic issues at play.

In recent weeks, Trump has made efforts to appeal to black Americans, posing a provocative question: what do they have to lose by voting for him? This rhetoric has sparked debate and skepticism among many in the African-American community, particularly in light of his previous statements and policies. In his speech, Trump made broad claims about the state of African-American communities, asserting that they are in the worst shape ever. These assertions have drawn backlash, as data shows significant progress among black Americans, including advancements in educational attainment and income increases.

One of the more controversial points raised by Trump was his suggestion of implementing ""stop and frisk"" policies, which he claimed had worked well in New York. However, he later clarified that this approach was intended for Chicago only, a distinction that has not alleviated concerns among critics who see such policies as exacerbating tensions between law enforcement and communities of color. The suggestion of ""stop and frisk"" has historically been met with resistance due to its potential for racial profiling and the negative impact it can have on community trust in law enforcement.

Throughout his speech, Trump sought to differentiate between what he referred to as ""violent disruptors"" and the broader black community. He emphasized the need to improve life for African-American families, suggesting that addressing the root causes of unrest is essential for fostering a more peaceful society. His comments reflect an understanding that the issues facing African-American communities are complex and multifaceted, requiring comprehensive solutions rather than simplistic narratives.

As protests continue to unfold in North Carolina and across the nation, the dialogue surrounding police violence and racial inequality remains urgent. Activists are calling for systemic change, demanding accountability for law enforcement and an end to practices that disproportionately affect communities of color. The protests serve as a reminder that the fight for justice and equality is far from over.

In the face of unrest, the administration's response will be closely scrutinized. The balance between maintaining public safety and addressing the legitimate grievances of marginalized communities is a delicate one, and how leaders choose to navigate this landscape will have lasting implications for the nation. As the situation develops, the voices of those advocating for change will continue to resonate, underscoring the imperative for a more just and equitable society.

In summary, the protests following the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott highlight the ongoing struggle against racial injustice and the need for meaningful dialogue and reform. President Trump's remarks reflect a complex interplay of support for law enforcement while also recognizing the challenges faced by African-American communities. As the nation grapples with these issues, the call for unity and understanding remains vital in the pursuit of lasting change.",-51.0,-53.0,768.0,-1.7,-0.06640625,810.0,-1.7666666666666666,-0.0654320987654321

Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.

Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”

So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.

Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.

How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right?

In a significant address to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama made a compelling case for the acceptance of certain constraints on U.S. freedom in exchange for enhanced national security. This call for a shift in perspective emphasizes the need for powerful nations to adopt international norms and engage with multilateral institutions, positing that cooperation should take precedence over conflict.

Obama articulated a vision where relinquishing some freedom of action could ultimately fortify national security while still safeguarding core American interests. He argued that the interconnectedness of today's global landscape necessitates a collaborative approach to governance and security, suggesting that isolationist tendencies could be detrimental in an increasingly complex world.

A particularly poignant aspect of Obama's address centered around the United States' role in accommodating Muslim refugees. He asserted that by welcoming those fleeing conflict and persecution, the U.S. would not only be acting in accordance with humanitarian principles but would also be contributing to a more secure global environment. This claim rests on the belief that fostering stability and goodwill among nations could deter extremism and promote peace.

However, criticism emerged in response to Obama's stance, with detractors questioning the implications of accepting large numbers of refugees without stringent vetting processes. Citing Germany's recent experiences with refugee influxes, critics argue that such policies could potentially compromise safety and security within the U.S. This skepticism raises important questions about the balance between humanitarian efforts and national security.

Moreover, the article expresses doubt regarding the efficacy of ceding sovereignty to international bodies as a means to enhance American safety. Critics contend that the idea of enhancing security through international cooperation often overlooks the potential risks associated with diminished national autonomy. This perspective challenges the notion that international collaboration inherently leads to greater security, suggesting instead that such approaches may inadvertently expose the U.S. to vulnerabilities.

Obama's views have been characterized as emblematic of a broader liberal ideology that some argue undermines American freedoms and constitutional rights. Critics assert that the acceptance of international norms and the prioritization of multilateral agreements may dilute the principles upon which the nation was founded. They contend that while cooperation is essential, it should not come at the expense of the freedoms and rights guaranteed to American citizens.

The tension between the ideals of international cooperation and the preservation of national sovereignty remains a contentious issue in contemporary political discourse. As nations grapple with the complexities of global interdependence, the debate over the appropriate balance between freedom and security continues to evolve.

In conclusion, Obama's address to the United Nations General Assembly has reignited discussions surrounding the role of the United States in the global arena. While advocating for a more collaborative approach to international relations, his proposals have drawn scrutiny from those who prioritize national sovereignty and security. The ongoing dialogue surrounding these issues underscores the challenges faced by policymakers as they navigate the intricate landscape of global cooperation while striving to protect the rights and freedoms of their citizens.",23.0,21.0,576.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03993055555555555,552.0,1.0,0.03804347826086957
Real_12-Webpage,Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works,"Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump’s vision.

As he made clear once again in Monday night’s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.”

Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ‘I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “Incomes went up for everybody.”

Story Continued Below

That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “My whole life is about winning. … I always win,” Trump says in explaining why he’s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “Winning the Global Competition.” You don’t get more zero-sum than that.

Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–Trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.

The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.

Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.

No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan’s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.

Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.

Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.

The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders’ powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.

Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. They aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.

We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.

As the political landscape in America becomes increasingly polarized, the contrasting economic philosophies of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have emerged as a central theme in the discourse surrounding the 2016 election. At the heart of this debate lies a fundamental disagreement over how economic growth is perceived and who benefits from it. Trump embodies a zero-sum worldview, where he posits that economic gains for one group come at the expense of another. In stark contrast, Clinton advocates for the belief that economic growth can be inclusive, benefiting all segments of society.

Trump's rhetoric has been steeped in the notion that the United States is losing its competitive edge on the global stage. He has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which he argues has significantly undermined American manufacturing jobs. By framing the issue in terms of loss and competition, Trump appeals to a growing demographic of Americans who feel that their economic security is threatened by globalization and trade policies that they perceive as favoring foreign interests over domestic ones.

On the other hand, Clinton's perspective draws from the economic policies of the 1990s, which she argues fostered an environment of rising incomes across the board. She points to the successes of that era, including the implementation of NAFTA, as evidence that open trade can lead to shared prosperity. According to Clinton, the economic growth experienced during this time was not a zero-sum game; rather, it was a period where many Americans, regardless of their socioeconomic status, saw improvements in their financial circumstances.

The 2016 election has highlighted a deep-seated polarization between those who view the economy through a zero-sum lens and those who believe in the potential for shared prosperity. As economic changes have reshaped the landscape of the American workforce, many individuals and communities have found themselves feeling left behind. This sense of disenfranchisement has fueled support for candidates like Trump, who promise to restore lost jobs and revitalize struggling industries. Similarly, figures like Bernie Sanders have tapped into this sentiment, advocating for policies that address economic inequality and aim to lift the burdens faced by the working class.

Economists, however, largely reject the zero-sum perspective that Trump espouses. Instead, they argue that globalization and open trade can lead to improved welfare for society as a whole. The prevailing view among economists is that trade can create new opportunities, drive innovation, and ultimately lead to a larger economic pie from which everyone can benefit. This view stands in stark contrast to the fears and frustrations voiced by many Americans who feel that their livelihoods are threatened by the forces of globalization.

The disconnect between average economic statistics and the lived experiences of individuals is a critical aspect of this debate. While national economic indicators may suggest growth and prosperity, many individuals—particularly in struggling regions—experience the effects of economic change very differently. This disparity has contributed to a growing sense of frustration and alienation among those who feel that they are not reaping the benefits of the economic changes taking place around them.

Support for Clinton tends to be strongest among urban populations, where economic growth has been more pronounced and opportunities for advancement are more readily available. Cities have often been the beneficiaries of globalization, with their economies thriving in the face of increased trade and investment. In contrast, Trump's appeal resonates deeply in rural and industrial areas, where individuals express feelings of economic insecurity and a longing for the return of traditional manufacturing jobs.

The historical context of this economic divide can be traced back to earlier movements in American history, such as the Progressive Movement, which sought to address issues of economic inequality and advocate for the rights of the working class. Figures like William Jennings Bryan, who famously championed the cause of the common man, criticized the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. This historical precedent underscores the ongoing struggle in American society to reconcile economic growth with equitable distribution of its benefits.

The implications of adopting a zero-sum approach to the economy are concerning. Such a perspective can lead to conflict and insecurity, as groups vie for limited resources and opportunities. In contrast, an open economy that embraces globalization and trade fosters innovation, collaboration, and broader prosperity. By focusing on the potential for shared growth, policymakers can work towards creating an environment where economic opportunities are accessible to all, rather than pitting one group against another in a battle for limited gains.

As the election approaches, the differing visions of Trump and Clinton will continue to shape the national conversation about the economy. The challenge lies in bridging the divide between those who feel left behind and those who are experiencing the benefits of economic growth. By fostering dialogue and understanding, it may be possible to cultivate a more inclusive approach to economic policy that recognizes the diverse experiences of all Americans.

In conclusion, the 2016 election serves as a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over economic growth and its beneficiaries. The contrasting worldviews of Trump and Clinton highlight the tensions between a zero-sum mentality and the belief in shared prosperity. As the nation grapples with these issues, it is essential to seek solutions that promote economic inclusivity and address the concerns of those who feel marginalized by the changing economic landscape. Only through a commitment to understanding and collaboration can America hope to navigate the complexities of its economic future.",72.0,66.0,1571.0,1.3333333333333333,0.04583068109484405,1021.0,1.736842105263158,0.06464250734573947
Real_13-Webpage,"President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill, Setting Up Showdown With Congress","President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

“I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message.

“I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”

The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.

Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.

The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.

If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.

Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.

""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.

""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.""

But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.

In a significant political move, President Barack Obama has vetoed the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" (JASTA), a piece of legislation that would allow survivors of the September 11 attacks and the families of victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. This decision follows an overwhelming approval of the bill by Congress, which passed with unanimous consent in both the House and Senate.

In a statement released from the White House, Obama expressed his deep sympathy for the families affected by the tragic events of 9/11. He reiterated his administration's commitment to assisting these families in their pursuit of justice. However, the president raised concerns about the implications of the bill, particularly regarding sovereign immunity, which protects foreign governments from being sued in U.S. courts. The administration fears that allowing such lawsuits could set a dangerous precedent, potentially opening the door for U.S. entities to face legal actions from foreign nations.

The veto has sparked a potential political showdown, as Congress now has the opportunity to attempt an override of the president's decision. If successful, this would mark the first veto override of Obama's presidency, a significant event considering his high approval ratings. To achieve an override, a two-thirds majority vote is required in both chambers of Congress. The White House is actively working to prevent this, emphasizing the potential negative repercussions on U.S. foreign relations, particularly with Saudi Arabia, a key ally in the Middle East.

Support for the legislation has been strong among many families of 9/11 victims, who are seeking accountability for all parties involved in the attacks. They argue that the bill is a necessary step to ensure that those who have suffered as a result of terrorism can seek justice against foreign sponsors. However, the Saudi government has been vocal in its opposition to the bill, denying any involvement with the terrorists responsible for the attacks and lobbying against the legislation.

The political ramifications of this veto are significant. With the bill passing through Congress without opposition, the potential for a veto override reflects a growing divide between the executive branch and the legislative branch on issues of national security and foreign relations. As Congress prepares to discuss the possibility of overriding the veto, the debate will likely center around the balance between seeking justice for victims and maintaining diplomatic relations with key allies.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also weighed in on the matter, expressing her support for the legislation should she be elected president. Her stance adds another layer to the ongoing discussion, as the political landscape shifts in anticipation of the upcoming election cycle.

As the situation unfolds, the focus will remain on the families of 9/11 victims, whose quest for justice has reignited conversations about accountability and the role of foreign nations in acts of terrorism. The outcome of this veto and any potential override will not only impact the families seeking justice but will also shape the future of U.S. foreign policy and its approach to combating terrorism on a global scale. 

As the nation watches closely, the implications of this decision will resonate far beyond the halls of Congress, affecting the lives of many and the course of U.S. relations with countries around the world.",-7.0,6.0,550.0,-0.4375,-0.012727272727272728,609.0,0.2857142857142857,0.009852216748768473

There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.

The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.

It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474473199000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUv7x5bXV4,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/riot.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice.

North Carolina witnessed a surge of unrest this past weekend as protests erupted in response to the shooting of a Black man on a highway. The demonstrations, which were primarily organized by activists associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, escalated into violence, drawing significant attention from both the local community and media outlets.

The situation intensified when a female truck driver found herself ambushed during the protests. As she sat inside her vehicle, her truck was looted, and the cargo it carried was set ablaze. The driver, clearly in distress, reached out to the police for assistance; however, her calls went unanswered as no officers arrived to help her in the chaotic scene. This incident highlights the dangers faced by individuals caught in the crossfire of protests that spiral out of control.

Media coverage of the protests included aerial footage captured by a helicopter, which provided a broader view of the unrest. The images depicted a scene of chaos, with protesters engaging in violent actions, including throwing rocks at passing vehicles. The aggression displayed by the demonstrators has raised serious concerns about the impact of such actions on the broader message of the Black Lives Matter movement.

As the night progressed, the situation continued to deteriorate. By the end of the evening, reports confirmed that 16 police officers had sustained injuries while attempting to manage the volatile environment. In response to the escalating violence, authorities made the decision to shut down the freeway, further complicating the situation for commuters and local residents.

Critics of the protests have voiced their concerns, arguing that the violent actions of a few individuals not only undermine the objectives of the Black Lives Matter movement but also exacerbate existing racial tensions within the community. The contrast between the current protests and the peaceful advocacy championed by civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. is stark. King famously advocated for love, integrity, and non-violence in the pursuit of justice, principles that seem to have been overshadowed by the recent unrest.

The actions of the protesters have sparked a debate about the effectiveness of violent protest as a means of enacting social change. While the original intent may have been to draw attention to systemic issues surrounding racial injustice, the ensuing violence has led to a backlash that threatens to derail the movement's progress. Many community members are left questioning the tactics employed by those who claim to represent their interests.

As the dust settles on the protests in North Carolina, it remains to be seen how this incident will affect public perception of the Black Lives Matter movement. The challenge will be to reconcile the need for urgent action against racial injustice with the imperative of maintaining peace and civility in advocacy efforts. The legacy of peaceful protest, as upheld by figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., serves as a reminder of the power of love and integrity in the fight for equality.

In the wake of the violence, community leaders and activists are urged to reflect on the methods employed during protests and to consider strategies that foster dialogue rather than division. The hope is that future demonstrations can honor the principles of peaceful advocacy while still addressing the critical issues that prompted the protests in the first place.",-44.0,-43.0,572.0,-1.6296296296296295,-0.07692307692307693,608.0,-1.8695652173913044,-0.07072368421052631
Real_15-Webpage,10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.

The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.

Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:

1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.

When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.

Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.”

He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.

2. Personal Attacks Came Early

Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker.

Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics.

“For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.

3. Trading Barbs Over Trade

Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.

“And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said.

Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”

Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.”

“Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said.

Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”

4. Trump Asks ‘Why Not’ Blame All the World’s Problems on Clinton

Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.”

Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?”

Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“

Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""

5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns

Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.

“I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.

Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said.

“I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?

“Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.

6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage

Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.

At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate.

Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015.

“Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”

7. Clinton Defends Being ‘Prepared’ When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail

Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff.

""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.”

Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.

8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion

Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.

“Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said.

Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.”

“They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal.

Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.

9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope

Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.

“I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”

Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.”

The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?""

Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.”

Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”

10. Sparring Over Stamina

Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.”

""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.”

Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.

""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said.

She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:

In a highly anticipated showdown, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and billionaire businessman Donald Trump faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York. The event, which drew millions of viewers nationwide, began with what appeared to be a cordial handshake and friendly greetings, but the underlying tension quickly became apparent as sarcasm peppered their exchanges throughout the evening.

From the outset, Clinton took aim at Trump's business background, highlighting his reliance on family wealth to kickstart his career. “You borrowed $14 million from your father to start your business,” she stated pointedly, framing it as a significant advantage that many Americans do not have. Trump, unfazed, downplayed the importance of the loan, emphasizing his success in building a profitable company from that initial investment. “I turned that money into a tremendous success,” he asserted, positioning himself as a self-made entrepreneur despite the familial assistance.

The debate intensified as the candidates clashed over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a key trade agreement that has divided opinions in the political arena. Trump accused Clinton of supporting the TPP, suggesting her previous statements indicated a willingness to endorse the deal. Clinton, however, firmly rebutted his claims, stating, “I opposed it after the negotiations,” highlighting her shift in stance as a response to public concerns. This exchange underscored the candidates' contrasting views on trade and economic policy, setting the stage for a contentious debate.

As the discussion progressed, Trump attempted to deflect criticism by shifting blame onto Clinton for various issues, which prompted a sarcastic remark from her. “I suppose I’ll be blamed for everything,” she quipped, a response that drew laughter from the audience but also illustrated the charged atmosphere of the debate. This tactic of blame-shifting became a recurring theme, with Trump attempting to link Clinton to a range of political controversies.

One of the more contentious topics was Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns, a practice that has become a norm among presidential candidates. When pressed on the issue, Trump claimed he would release his tax documents once Clinton made her deleted emails public. This statement not only showcased his strategy of deflection but also reignited the controversy surrounding Clinton's email practices during her tenure as Secretary of State.

The debate also revisited the birther issue, a topic that has haunted Trump for years. He claimed satisfaction with the release of President Barack Obama’s birth certificate, despite having spent years questioning its authenticity. This acknowledgment came as a surprise to many, given Trump’s previous insistence on the matter and his role in perpetuating the conspiracy theory.

In a moment that highlighted the candidates' contrasting debate preparations, Clinton defended her approach to campaign strategy in response to Trump’s criticism of her time away from the campaign trail. She emphasized the importance of thorough preparation and experience, suggesting that her extensive background in politics and public service equipped her to handle the demands of the presidency.

The controversial stop and frisk policy, which has faced significant scrutiny for its implications on civil rights, was another hot-button issue in the debate. Trump asserted that the policy had a positive impact on New York City’s safety, arguing that it contributed to a decrease in crime rates. Clinton, however, countered by highlighting the negative effects of such policies on communities of color, framing the discussion within the context of broader social justice concerns.

As the debate continued, Trump found himself in a heated exchange regarding his past support for the Iraq War. Despite evidence suggesting otherwise, he denied having supported the military intervention, leading the moderator to step in and correct him. This moment not only illustrated the contentious nature of the debate but also highlighted the challenges candidates face when reconciling their past statements with current narratives.

In a dramatic conclusion, Trump questioned Clinton's stamina for the presidency, suggesting that her time in public office might not translate into the energy required for the role. Clinton, unfazed by the jab, countered by highlighting her extensive experience and contrasting it with Trump’s controversial remarks about women. “I have been fighting for women’s rights my entire career,” she asserted, positioning herself as a champion for gender equality while also addressing the personal attacks she has faced from Trump.

The debate at Hofstra University encapsulated the stark differences between the two candidates, setting the tone for the election season ahead. With both candidates employing a mix of sarcasm, personal attacks, and policy discussions, the debate served as a microcosm of the larger political landscape, showcasing the contentious nature of the 2016 presidential race. As viewers processed the exchanges, it became clear that the battle for the presidency would be as much about personality and perception as it would be about policy and governance.",50.0,-13.0,2076.0,0.6024096385542169,0.024084778420038536,932.0,-0.3939393939393939,-0.013948497854077254
Real_16-Webpage,Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

“I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

“It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

“Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",http://abcn.ws/2cTj7ap,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"More Michael,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting3_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting1_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting2_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_12x5_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939,"{""fb_title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""description"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@MichaelEHayden"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:03:26"", ""keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter, us news, national news, local news"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter""}","- Peaceful protesters attended Charlotte's city council meeting following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott.

Charlotte, NC - A peaceful assembly of protesters gathered at the city council meeting on Tuesday night, voicing their concerns following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. The incident, which sparked widespread protests across the city, has reignited discussions about police violence and its impact on the community, particularly among children and families.

Over 50 individuals took to the podium during the meeting, passionately speaking out against police brutality and the systemic issues that contribute to such violence. Among the most poignant voices was that of 10-year-old Zianna Oliphant, who delivered an emotional plea that resonated with many in attendance. Zianna highlighted the profound effects of police shootings on children and the black community, stating, “I can’t stand how we’re treated.” Her heartfelt remarks underscored the fear and sadness that many young people experience in the wake of such tragedies.

Zianna also reflected on the pain of losing parents to violence, drawing attention to the fact that Scott was a father to seven children. Her words served as a reminder of the human cost of police violence, emphasizing the need for change and accountability within law enforcement.

The protests in Charlotte began shortly after Scott's shooting, which has led to a mix of peaceful demonstrations and instances of unrest. Tensions escalated in the following days, with police deploying tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators. These confrontations included protesters throwing objects at police, blocking highways, and instances of looting, showcasing the heightened emotions surrounding the incident.

During the city council meeting, Mayor Jennifer Roberts urged attendees to maintain decorum as protesters directed their frustrations toward her and Police Chief Kerr Putney. The atmosphere was charged, as many attendees expressed their dissatisfaction with the handling of the situation and called for transparency regarding the events leading up to Scott's death.

After the meeting concluded, protesters chanted for the release of the full video of Scott's shooting, demanding clarity and accountability. Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, echoed this call in an interview, emphasizing the need for the complete release of the footage to understand the circumstances surrounding the incident fully.

While Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera footage from the incident, questions remain about whether Scott was armed or posed a threat to officers at the time of the shooting. The ambiguity surrounding these details has fueled the ongoing protests and calls for justice from the community.

As the city grapples with the aftermath of Scott's shooting, the voices of protesters and community members continue to resonate, demanding change and accountability from law enforcement. The emotional testimonies shared at the city council meeting reflect a broader desire for a safer and more just society, where the lives of all individuals, particularly those in marginalized communities, are valued and protected.

The situation in Charlotte remains fluid, with community leaders and activists working to ensure that the conversation around police violence does not fade.

As the community continues to rally for justice, the eyes of the nation remain focused on Charlotte, hoping for a resolution that honors the lives lost and paves the way for meaningful change.",-57.0,-27.0,570.0,-2.28,-0.1,633.0,-1.2857142857142858,-0.04265402843601896

(CNN) Jeb Bush will be a guest lecturer at Harvard University this fall, focusing on education in ""a number of multi-day visits"" this semester, the John F. Kennedy School of Government announced Tuesday.

Real_18-Webpage,Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night’s big debate: Don’t let Donald Trump get away with it.

And Trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.”

Story Continued Below

The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.”

“The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,” Silver tweeted.

During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.

“We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told “CBS This Morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, “that that simply be checked.”

“The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.

But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump’s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he’s a Democrat and the system is “very unfair.” The “NBC Nightly News” anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.

“I don’t know that he knew what Lester Holt’s voter registration was,” said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. “He didn’t lie,” Conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.”

In a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, Monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn’t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.

But Clinton’s campaign has beat up on Holt’s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. “In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” Janet Brown, the commission’s executive director, told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

For her part, Clinton won’t let Trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn’t, either.

“There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.”

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.

“I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “You can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but I don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.”

Trump’s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp’s preparation for two Trumps.

“We don’t want Donald Trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We’re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” Mook told NBC’s “Today.”

Asked about Clinton’s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that “it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.”

But Conway shot down the notion that there’s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that “Overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and Conway joined the pile-on.

“He’s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,” Conway said. “And that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.”

After Mook warned against “a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” Conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.”

“I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.”

Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.

“I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.

“What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,” Conway said. “Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.”

Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance.

“So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself — and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.

""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""

As the nation gears up for the highly anticipated presidential debate, the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are already embroiled in a fierce battle of narratives and expectations. With just days to go until the event, both sides are ramping up their efforts to sway public opinion and prepare their candidates for what promises to be a contentious exchange.

Clinton’s campaign is making a strong case for the need to ensure that Donald Trump does not mislead voters during the debate. They are advocating for real-time fact-checking, a request that they have directed toward the debate’s moderator, Lester Holt. The Clinton team is concerned that without immediate accountability, Trump could use the platform to spread misinformation, potentially swaying undecided voters at a critical juncture in the campaign.

In response, Trump’s campaign has accused the media of bias against their candidate and has characterized Clinton’s demands as an attempt to manipulate the debate process. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, has come forward to defend Trump’s claims regarding Holt’s supposed bias. Conway has expressed skepticism about Clinton's expectations for the moderator, suggesting that they are unrealistic and indicative of a broader strategy to undermine Trump.

Recent polling data indicates that the race for the presidency is tightening, with Trump gaining ground nationally as well as in key battleground states. This shift in momentum has heightened the stakes for both candidates, making the upcoming debate even more pivotal in shaping the final weeks of the election.

The Commission on Presidential Debates has weighed in on the issue, reiterating that moderators are not meant to fact-check candidates during the debate. Instead, they should facilitate a dialogue that allows candidates to address each other's statements. This stance has added another layer of complexity to the debate dynamics, as Clinton’s press secretary continues to insist that Trump’s potential falsehoods should be called out in real-time.

Amidst this backdrop, Trump’s former campaign manager has downplayed the necessity for a fact-checking moderator. He argues that accountability should primarily rest with the candidates themselves, suggesting that each should be prepared to defend their statements without external intervention. This sentiment aligns with the Trump campaign’s portrayal of Clinton as overly prepared and robotic, in stark contrast to their candidate, who they assert will be genuine and spontaneous on stage.

As the debate approaches, Conway has expressed concern that media narratives may unfairly depict Trump as aggressive towards Clinton. This worry reflects a broader strategy by the Trump campaign to frame their candidate’s demeanor in a favorable light, positioning him as relatable and authentic in contrast to Clinton’s polished and calculated approach.

Adding to the mix, Rudy Giuliani, a prominent supporter of Trump, has advised the candidate to remain true to himself during the debate. He has cautioned Trump against trying to match Clinton’s policy expertise, emphasizing the importance of authenticity over technical knowledge in connecting with voters.

As both campaigns prepare for the impending debate, the tension between the two candidates is palpable. The stakes are high, and with public opinion shifting, every word exchanged on stage could have significant repercussions for the electoral landscape. The clash of strategies, narratives, and expectations sets the stage for what could be a defining moment in the 2024 presidential race. 

As the debate looms, the question remains: will the candidates stick to their narratives, or will the pressure of the moment lead to unexpected revelations?

Real_19-Webpage,Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?,"I’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I’m pretty much baffled.

The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: “You’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.

Story Continued Below

Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that’s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”)

Further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).

By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump—bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post—but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump—and he's still standing.

Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history.

The Focus Is on “Moments”—But They’re Not Always The Key

Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:

“Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked Americans ‘are you better off?’ Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.”

These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It’s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “You’ve all become theater critics.”)

But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.

The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.

There Are Three Debates, Not One—And That Can Matter A Whole Lot

One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th—barely a week before the election.

Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That’s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.

Here, I think, is an opening for Clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).

Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo

The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.

“Well,” he said, “they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.”

Judo, however, can cut both ways. There’s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.

“Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.”

Debates Are NOT Decisive

One last note. It’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory.

In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.

Of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. So you’ll probably want to tune in anyway

As the 2016 presidential election approached, the spotlight turned to the upcoming debates, a key battleground where candidates would face off and attempt to sway undecided voters. With nearly 40 years of experience analyzing presidential debates, including the notable Kennedy-Humphrey debate in 1960, one can appreciate the intricate dynamics at play in these high-stakes encounters. This election cycle, the debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump promised to be particularly challenging, given Trump's unpredictable nature and the potential for Clinton's strengths to be turned against her.

Clinton entered the debate arena armed with a wealth of experience in government, a point that Trump was likely to attack vigorously. He could argue that her long tenure in public service contributed to the very issues that voters were now grappling with. This strategy would not only seek to undermine her credibility but also position Trump as the outsider, a candidate who could bring about change in a system that many Americans felt was broken.

One of Trump's most effective strategies could be what has been termed ""political judo."" This technique involves using an opponent's strengths against them, a tactic that Trump has demonstrated throughout his campaign. By reframing Clinton's extensive experience as part of the problem rather than a solution, he could effectively shift the narrative in his favor. This would require a deft touch, as he would need to reassure college-educated white voters who had previously resisted him, similar to the challenge faced by Ronald Reagan in 1980 when he sought to broaden his appeal.

For Clinton, the debate presented the challenge of establishing herself as ""honest and trustworthy."" This was a crucial aspect of her campaign, especially in light of the controversies that had surrounded her, including her use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. Trump's ability to bring these issues to the forefront during the debate could significantly undermine her efforts to connect with voters on a personal level.

Historically, presidential debates are often remembered for specific ""moments"" or gaffes that can define a candidate's performance. However, the cumulative effect of the exchanges during the debates can also play a pivotal role in determining the overall outcome. The presence of Trump in the debates increased the likelihood of memorable moments, given his propensity for provocative statements and actions. Nevertheless, a consistent and composed performance from Clinton could serve her well, allowing her to capitalize on any missteps made by Trump.

The debate format included three encounters, providing candidates the opportunity to recover from any earlier performances. This structure allowed for the possibility of momentum shifts, as seen in past elections where candidates were able to bounce back after a challenging debate. Clinton's ability to connect with voters in town hall meetings could be an advantage, as these settings allowed her to address personal concerns and present her proposals in a relatable manner.

Moreover, Trump's claims of leadership and decisiveness could be countered by Clinton highlighting his lack of transparency regarding his taxes and business practices. This line of attack could resonate with voters who value accountability and integrity in their leaders. By focusing on these issues, Clinton could frame the debate as not just a contest of personalities, but as a discussion of the values and principles that should guide the nation.

While debates are often viewed as critical moments in the election cycle, it is essential to recognize that their impact may be marginal compared to fundamental issues at play, such as economic performance and the polarized nature of the electorate. Voters often make decisions based on a range of factors, and while debates can influence perceptions, they are not always decisive in determining the outcome of an election.

The author emphasizes that while the debates between Clinton and Trump would undoubtedly be significant, the broader context of the election would ultimately play a more substantial role. Economic conditions, social issues, and the political landscape would all contribute to shaping voter sentiment as they headed to the polls.

In conclusion, the upcoming debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would serve as a critical platform for both candidates to present their visions for the future of America. With Clinton's extensive experience and Trump's unorthodox approach, the debates promised to be a fascinating study in contrasts. As the candidates prepared to face off, the stakes could not have been higher, with the potential to influence the course of the election and the direction of the nation.

Real_2-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have',"Story highlights ""This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" Clinton said

The deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage in the election

Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.

""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.""

The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.

During a campaign event in Orlando, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed her deep sorrow over the recent police killings of two African-American men, describing the tragedies as ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable."" Clinton's remarks came in response to the deaths of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma and Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina, which have sparked widespread protests and renewed discussions about police use of lethal force.

Clinton acknowledged the ongoing debate surrounding the issue, recognizing the complexities involved and the lack of complete information regarding the incidents. She highlighted the growing list of African Americans who have lost their lives at the hands of police, noting that the addition of Crutcher and Scott's names underscores a troubling pattern.

""Too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" Clinton stated, while candidly admitting that she does not possess all the answers to this pressing issue. Her comments reflect a broader concern over systemic racism and the urgent need for reform within law enforcement.

In light of the protests that erupted following the killings, Clinton urged the public to refrain from directing anger towards police officers. She emphasized the importance of constructive dialogue and understanding, advocating for a collective effort to address the root causes of these tragedies rather than fostering division.

Clinton's statements resonate with many who are calling for accountability and change within the justice system, as the nation continues to grapple with the implications of these recent events. Her remarks serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for racial equality and the need for comprehensive solutions to prevent further loss of life.",-27.0,-33.0,304.0,-2.25,-0.08881578947368421,312.0,-3.3,-0.10576923076923077

Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton.

“The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?”

“I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.”

Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race.

“He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”

In a recent statement, Gary Johnson expressed his pride in providing voters with an alternative to the traditional major party candidates in the upcoming election. Johnson, the Libertarian nominee, articulated his belief that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would lead flawed presidencies, positioning himself as a viable option for those disillusioned with the two-party system.

Addressing concerns about potentially being a spoiler for Clinton, Johnson dismissed these worries, asserting that voters who choose him are motivated by his candidacy rather than simply opting for the lesser of two evils. He emphasized the significance of offering a ""first vote"" to those seeking a different political direction, particularly as he noted that 50% of new voters are registering as independents. This statistic raises questions about the dominance of the two-party candidates in the current political climate.

In response to Johnson's campaign, Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, chose to downplay the impact of Johnson's candidacy. He pointed out that Johnson's poll numbers have recently dropped to 5%, suggesting that while Johnson's presence may influence both major candidates, it is unlikely to result in a significant change in the overall election outcome.

As the election approaches, Johnson's message resonates with a growing segment of the electorate that seeks alternatives beyond the established parties. His campaign continues to highlight the importance of independent voices in shaping the political landscape, challenging the status quo and advocating for a broader spectrum of choices for voters.",4.0,-3.0,300.0,0.5,0.013333333333333334,285.0,-0.3333333333333333,-0.010526315789473684

Real_22-Webpage,Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.”

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.”

Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

The Senate reconvened this week, with Democrats introducing a new bill aimed at increasing transparency among presidential candidates. This proposed legislation seeks to require candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving their party's nomination, a move that advocates argue is essential for informed voter decision-making.

Under the terms of the bill, if a candidate fails to disclose their tax returns within the specified timeframe, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would be mandated to release the documents after a 30-day period. This stipulation is designed to ensure that voters have access to crucial financial information about candidates, allowing them to better understand the potential conflicts of interest and ethical considerations at play.

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) expressed optimism regarding the bill, indicating that there would be opportunities for a vote on the legislation in the near future. The push for transparency comes at a time when scrutiny of candidates’ financial backgrounds is more pertinent than ever.

Historically, the release of tax returns has been a point of contention in presidential elections. Notably, both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have disclosed over 30 years of tax returns, setting a precedent for transparency. In contrast, only one candidate since 1976, Gerald Ford, has notably refrained from releasing such information. This disparity raises questions about the accountability of current candidates.

The issue of tax return disclosure gained significant attention during the 2012 election when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid publicly criticized Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns. Reid suggested that Romney was concealing substantial financial information, a claim that was partially substantiated by a Bloomberg News article released prior to the election. The article revealed that Romney had a high income while paying minimal taxes, lending credence to Reid's assertions.

Recently, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has turned his focus to former President Donald Trump, labeling him as ""ethically compromised"" and referring to him as ""the king of the welfare kings."" Reid’s comments underscore a growing sentiment among some lawmakers that transparency in financial matters is critical for public trust in elected officials.

The current discourse emphasizes the importance of voters having access to Trump's tax return details to make informed decisions during elections. This contrasts sharply with the financial transparency demonstrated by Hillary Clinton, which has been a point of discussion in the political arena.

As the Senate considers this new legislation, there is a growing call to action for Congress to address the implications of Trump's actions and the broader issue of transparency among presidential candidates. The proposed bill represents a significant step towards ensuring that voters have the information necessary to hold candidates accountable and make informed choices at the ballot box. The conversation surrounding transparency is not just about tax returns; it is about restoring faith in the electoral process and ensuring that all candidates are subject to the same standards of disclosure.",-9.0,19.0,496.0,-0.6428571428571429,-0.018145161290322582,548.0,0.95,0.03467153284671533
Real_23-Webpage,Dem congressman to IRS: Audit the Trump Foundation,"Story highlights Trump reportedly used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes,"" Sander Levin wrote to the IRS

Washington (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen

The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.

The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.

Real_24-Webpage,Armed Intruders Break in House…Armed Resident Responds – Eagle Rising,"Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun.

The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway.

After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away.

In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.”

Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.”

In a dramatic incident early Friday morning, a resident's home in Atlanta became the scene of a violent confrontation when three armed men entered unexpectedly around 4:00 AM. The homeowner's co-worker, who was present for work, responded swiftly by retrieving a handgun and engaging the intruders.

The entire altercation was captured on the home's surveillance camera, providing crucial evidence of the event. The co-worker fired multiple rounds at the intruders, which ultimately caused them to flee the scene. However, one of the intruders sustained fatal gunshot wounds and was found deceased in the driveway.

Following the confrontation, the homeowner intervened to calm the shaken co-worker and took possession of the firearm. Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington addressed the incident, emphasizing the homeowner's right to defend themselves in such threatening situations. He also remarked on the unusual nature of having detailed surveillance footage available, which is rare in home invasion cases.

Authorities are now focusing on the video evidence to aid in the identification of the two remaining suspects, who escaped the scene without masks.

Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.

“They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.”

Story Continued Below

Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.

“I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.”

“Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.”

Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.

""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.

“I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""

While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.

“I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”

Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.""

“I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”

In a post-debate analysis that has garnered significant attention, former President Donald Trump took aim at debate moderator Lester Holt, asserting that the questioning during the recent debate was unfair and biased against him. Trump’s remarks focused on what he perceived as Holt's failure to address key issues surrounding his opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Trump's criticisms were directed at Holt's approach during the debate, where he claimed the moderator concentrated excessively on his past tax returns and various lawsuits. According to Trump, these topics overshadowed crucial discussions about Clinton's own controversies. ""Lester Holt did not ask about the emails, the Benghazi incident, or the Clinton Foundation,"" Trump stated, emphasizing that these issues deserved equal scrutiny.

The former president was particularly vocal about his assessment of Holt's performance, giving him a grade of C+ for his moderation. While Trump acknowledged that he appreciated the structure of the first part of the debate, he expressed dissatisfaction with the nature of the questions posed later on. He labeled these inquiries as biased, suggesting that they were designed to put him at a disadvantage while allowing Clinton to evade accountability for her actions.

Trump's campaign team, including prominent figures such as Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence and senior advisor Kellyanne Conway, echoed his sentiments regarding Holt's moderation. They reinforced the notion that Holt failed to challenge Clinton on significant issues that have long been a point of contention in the political arena. The campaign's unified front in criticizing Holt indicates a strategic effort to redirect public attention to Clinton's alleged scandals while reinforcing Trump's stance that he was treated unfairly during the debate.

Adding to the drama of the debate, Trump reported experiencing microphone issues that he suggested may have been tampered with, further complicating his performance on stage. He raised concerns about the integrity of the debate format, hinting at the possibility of interference that could have affected how he was able to communicate his points effectively.

One moment that particularly irked Trump during the debate was when Clinton brought up Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe. Trump admitted that he felt provoked by Clinton’s mention of Machado, stating that it was the first time she truly got under his skin. In response to Clinton's characterization of Machado, Trump defended his past comments about her, describing her as ""difficult to work with."" He disputed Clinton’s portrayal, suggesting that the narrative surrounding Machado was being manipulated for political gain.

The fallout from the debate and Trump's subsequent criticisms of Holt and Clinton has sparked a renewed conversation about the role of moderators in political debates and the fairness of questioning. As the campaign progresses, it remains to be seen how these issues will influence voter perceptions and the overall electoral landscape.

With the election drawing closer, Trump's focus on Clinton's controversies and his critique of the debate format may serve as a rallying cry for his supporters, who are eager to see their candidate challenge the status quo. Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign will likely continue to emphasize her policy proposals and responses to Trump's criticisms as they seek to solidify their position ahead of the polls.

As both campaigns navigate the complexities of the political discourse, the debates serve as a critical platform for candidates to present their visions and address pressing issues. The dynamics established in these discussions will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping voter opinions as the race intensifies in the coming weeks. 

In conclusion, Trump's criticisms of Lester Holt and his focus on Clinton's controversies highlight the contentious atmosphere of the current electoral cycle. The interplay between the candidates, the moderator, and the issues at stake will continue to unfold as the election approaches, making each debate a pivotal moment in the race for the presidency.",-41.0,-21.0,1119.0,-1.025,-0.03663985701519214,724.0,-0.84,-0.029005524861878452

In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.

Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.

From the Daily Mail:

National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.

A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.

On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street.

After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.

A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is grappling with a second consecutive night of violent protests following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an armed black suspect. The unrest has prompted Governor Roy Cooper to declare a state of emergency in response to the escalating violence that has gripped the city.

The protests, which began as demonstrations against police brutality, have taken a chaotic turn, resulting in multiple injuries and significant property damage. A particularly alarming incident involved a protester who was critically wounded after being shot in the head by another protester. This individual is currently on life support, highlighting the dangerous atmosphere that has enveloped the city. In addition to this critical injury, three other protesters and four police officers have sustained injuries during the tumultuous events.

The situation has escalated to a point where reporters covering the protests have also faced threats. Reports indicate that attempts were made to harm journalists, including a WCNC-TV cameraman and a CNN correspondent, further complicating the already volatile environment.

In an effort to restore order, the National Guard has been deployed to assist local law enforcement. This move is part of a broader strategy to manage the unrest that has seen demonstrators engage in destructive behaviors, including breaking windows and looting stores. Vandalism has occurred at multiple locations throughout the city, notably at the NASCAR Hall of Fame and various businesses, raising concerns among local officials and residents alike.

As the violence continues, major companies have advised their employees to avoid the downtown area, reflecting the severity of the situation. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is contemplating the implementation of a curfew as a measure to quell the unrest and restore a semblance of order. The mayor's consideration of a curfew underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for decisive action.

The protests have drawn a mixed response from the community. While some individuals have come forward to defend the police and their actions, a significant number of protesters have engaged in violent acts. Tensions reached a boiling point when demonstrators retaliated against police with projectiles following the shooting of a fellow protester. This exchange of violence has transformed what began as a peaceful protest into what many are describing as a riot, raising concerns about the potential for broader societal implications.

Charlotte's streets, once a hub of commerce and community, have become the backdrop for a clash between those demanding justice and those tasked with maintaining order. The juxtaposition of peaceful intentions and violent outbursts has left many residents feeling unsettled and fearful for their safety. The growing unrest has prompted discussions about the underlying issues of race, policing, and community relations, which are now at the forefront of national conversations.

As the situation develops, the community remains on edge, with many questioning what the future holds for Charlotte in the wake of these protests. The declaration of a state of emergency serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the city as it navigates the complexities of these protests. With the National Guard now involved, local officials are hoping to restore calm and prevent further violence.

In the days ahead, the focus will likely shift to addressing the root causes of the unrest and finding a path toward healing and reconciliation. The events in Charlotte are not just a local issue; they resonate with a broader narrative that has unfolded in cities across the nation, where similar protests have erupted in response to police shootings and systemic injustices.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of these violent protests, the community is left to ponder the implications of this unrest and what it means for the future of policing, race relations, and community safety. The road ahead will require dialogue, understanding, and a commitment to addressing the grievances that have fueled this unrest. In the meantime, the residents of Charlotte are left to navigate the uncertain landscape of their city, seeking peace amid the chaos.",-82.0,-62.0,674.0,-2.484848484848485,-0.12166172106824925,736.0,-2.1379310344827585,-0.08423913043478261
Real_27-Webpage,Rouhani: Iran deal able to weather the election,"Rouhani: Iran deal able to weather the election

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked Rouhani whether he'd rather work with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. Rouhani said, ""Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.

Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.

Real_28-Webpage,“How Can we LEAD When we Can’t Even Control Our Own Cities?” [VIDEO] – Eagle Rising,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said:

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.

“Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.

“Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?

“We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.

“Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.

“The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.

“There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.

In a recent address in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump spoke candidly about the national unrest that has followed a series of officer-involved shootings across the United States. His remarks came during a time of heightened tension and division, as cities grapple with protests and calls for reform.

Trump's speech centered on the theme of unity, underscoring the necessity for Americans to come together in the face of adversity. He emphasized that unity is paramount for the nation to navigate through tough times, urging citizens to transcend their differences. ""We must respect the flag and work toward becoming a united nation with shared values,"" he stated, reinforcing the idea that collective strength is essential for overcoming challenges.

In his address, Trump expressed deep concern about the ongoing unrest in cities such as Charlotte, highlighting the potential impact on the country's image and the leadership within it. He acknowledged the right of Americans to engage in peaceful protest, a fundamental aspect of democratic expression, but he was quick to condemn any violent disruptions that jeopardize public safety. ""All Americans deserve to live in safe communities,"" he declared, calling for an immediate end to violence against both citizens and law enforcement.

Trump's remarks also touched on the disproportionate impact of violence and unrest on law-abiding African-American residents. He pointed out that these communities often bear the brunt of riots and crime, stressing the government's responsibility to ensure their safety and wellbeing. ""We cannot tolerate lawlessness,"" he asserted, making it clear that under a Trump administration, crime and violence would not be accepted.

The former president's focus was notably directed toward supporting families and communities, particularly African-American parents who are striving to provide safe environments for their children. He acknowledged their struggles and reiterated his commitment to fostering a sense of security for all families, regardless of their background.

As Trump wrapped up his speech, he reiterated the importance of coming together as a nation to heal and move forward. His call for unity resonated with many in attendance, who are eager for solutions to the pressing issues facing their communities. The speech served as a reminder of the complexities surrounding the national dialogue on race, justice, and public safety.

In a time when the nation is facing significant challenges, Trump's message aimed to inspire hope and collective action among Americans. His insistence on shared values and respect for the flag highlighted a vision for a united future, one where citizens work collaboratively to address the issues at hand.

As the country continues to grapple with unrest and calls for change, Trump's address in Pittsburgh underscores the critical need for dialogue and understanding. The former president's emphasis on unity and safety reflects a broader desire among many Americans for stability and peace in their communities.",-5.0,11.0,540.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.009259259259259259,538.0,0.55,0.020446096654275093
Real_29-Webpage,9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him,"""Donald, you’re a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him

Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.

That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father.

Story Continued Below

1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection

In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.”

“The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’”

2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward”

Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.”

“It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said.

3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully”

“Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said . “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.”

4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women”

Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.”

5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky”

In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.”

6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth”

Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.”

7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said

“I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said .

8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer”

Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’

And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.”

9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family

“I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.

Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.

In a dramatic political twist, Senator Ted Cruz has officially endorsed former President Donald Trump, a mere two months after facing backlash at the Republican National Convention for his initial reluctance to back the controversial figure. This endorsement marks a significant shift in Cruz's stance, especially considering the vitriolic exchanges that have characterized their relationship over the past few months.

Cruz's endorsement comes on the heels of a series of hostile comments he directed towards Trump. The Texas senator has been vocal about his grievances, particularly in response to Trump's attacks on his family. Cruz’s wife, Heidi, and his father, Rafael, became subjects of Trump's insults, igniting a fierce feud that played out in the public eye. Cruz's initial reluctance to endorse Trump was punctuated by his emotional response to the attacks, which he deemed unacceptable.

In February, Cruz speculated that Trump's tax returns might unveil connections to organized crime, a comment that implied he believed Trump was concealing something significant. This speculation was just the beginning of a series of sharp remarks from Cruz, who, in March, labeled Trump a ""sniveling coward"" for threatening to expose damaging information about Cruz's wife. This marked a turning point in their relationship, as Cruz publicly confronted Trump over what he perceived as a low blow.

The senator did not hold back in his criticism, describing Trump as a ""big, loud New York bully."" Cruz emphasized that political attacks should not extend to family members, asserting that such tactics are beneath the dignity of political discourse. His characterization of Trump as ""a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women"" further illustrated the depth of Cruz's disdain for the former president at that time.

Cruz's criticisms continued into May, when he dismissed Trump's claims regarding his father's alleged involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as ""nuts"" and ""kooky."" This dismissal was emblematic of Cruz's broader concerns about Trump's credibility. He labeled Trump a ""pathological liar,"" accusing him of fabricating stories and then projecting those lies onto others. Cruz elaborated on this point, suggesting that Trump could easily pass a lie detector test while simultaneously making contradictory statements, highlighting what he perceived as Trump's utter lack of morality.

Moreover, Cruz accused Trump of being a narcissist and a ""serial philanderer,"" asserting that Trump takes pride in his infidelities. This accusation not only painted a picture of Trump as morally compromised but also revealed Cruz's deep-seated concerns about Trump's character and suitability for leadership. The senator's ongoing resentment towards Trump was palpable, particularly in July when he reiterated his refusal to support anyone who slanders his loved ones. This sentiment resonated with many who viewed Cruz as a staunch defender of family values.

Despite the tumultuous backdrop of insults and accusations, Cruz's endorsement of Trump stands as a testament to the complex dynamics within the Republican Party. The endorsement may signal a strategic alignment with Trump as the party gears up for future elections, despite the personal animosities that have been laid bare over the past year. Cruz's decision to back Trump could be interpreted as a pragmatic move aimed at unifying the party, even if it means overlooking past grievances.

The endorsement raises questions about the nature of political loyalty and the lengths to which politicians will go to maintain party unity. Cruz's journey from vehement critic to supporter of Trump highlights the often tumultuous relationships within the GOP, where personal animosities can be set aside in favor of political expediency. It also reflects a broader trend in American politics, where endorsements can shift rapidly in response to changing political landscapes.

As the Republican Party navigates its future, Cruz's endorsement of Trump may serve as a rallying point for party members who are looking to consolidate support behind a familiar figure. However, it also underscores the ongoing challenges that come with reconciling personal beliefs with party loyalty. Cruz's past comments about Trump will likely linger in the minds of voters, creating a complex narrative that will shape perceptions of both men as they move forward.

In conclusion, Ted Cruz's endorsement of Donald Trump is a noteworthy development in the ever-evolving landscape of American politics. It encapsulates the tensions and complexities of party loyalty, personal grievances, and the strategic decisions that politicians must make in an increasingly polarized environment. As Cruz transitions from a vocal critic to a supporter, the implications of his endorsement will undoubtedly resonate within the Republican Party and beyond, prompting discussions about the nature of political alliances in the modern era.",-40.0,-5.0,974.0,-1.2903225806451613,-0.04106776180698152,884.0,-0.15625,-0.005656108597285068

Wake County is the fourth county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties.

Washington (CNN)

Few counties could prove more decisive in this election than Wake County, North Carolina.

A historically competitive county whose fortunes are on the rise, Wake could help deliver Hillary Clinton a win in a key battleground state -- or dash her hopes for the presidency. Simply put, if Clinton performs well in the highly educated research triangle, then election night bodes well for her. If Wake County doesn't come out for Clinton, Donald Trump's path to the White House would grow much clearer.

The county is rapidly expanding, and the influx of new people and industries could reshape the race. Meanwhile, the turmoil across the state in Charlotte after a police officer shot and killed a black man could add another focal point in the election — search data from Google Trends shows Wake County's spiking interest in ""police brutality"" this week.

Keep your eye on Wake County, and take a look at the fundamentals below.

Population

Wake County is fairly representative of the country in terms of race and ethnicity, but it has a more highly educated population, bigger incomes and a better job picture than the rest of the nation.

As part of CNN's ""Critical Counties"" series, Wake County, North Carolina, has emerged as a pivotal area in the 2016 election cycle. Recognized for its potential to sway the overall election outcome, Wake County's performance is closely watched, particularly regarding Hillary Clinton's prospects in this key battleground state.

The Research Triangle, known for its educated populace, shows strong support for Clinton, which could signal a favorable election night for her campaign. This backing is essential, as Wake County's voting patterns may significantly influence the overall results in North Carolina. However, a lack of support from this rapidly growing county could bolster Donald Trump's chances, highlighting the importance of voter sentiment in the region.

Recent events in nearby Charlotte, particularly incidents of police violence, have heightened local awareness around critical issues such as police brutality. This growing concern could play a role in shaping voter priorities and turnout in Wake County, further complicating the election dynamics.

Demographically, Wake County stands out with its diverse population, higher education levels, and greater incomes, all contributing to a robust job market that surpasses national averages.

President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

“What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.”

“That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.

The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.

“Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”

In a notable moment during the White House Tribal Nations Conference, President Barack Obama broke an unwritten rule regarding presidential headgear, as he was presented with a hat and blanket by Native American leaders. The event, which celebrated the contributions and cultures of Native American communities, took a light-hearted turn when Obama donned a traditional blanket around his shoulders while a song was performed in his honor.

Although he embraced the blanket, the President promptly removed the hat shortly after receiving it, a decision that seemed to reflect his awareness of the unofficial guideline against presidents wearing unusual headgear. This guideline, which has its roots in the infamous tank-commander’s helmet incident involving former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, has lingered in political discourse for decades.

During his remarks at the conference, Obama expressed heartfelt gratitude for the gifts and the gesture, humorously noting that he might need the blanket to keep his wife, Michelle, from taking it from him. This light-hearted comment underscored the warmth of the occasion, where Obama took time to reflect on the friendships he had developed throughout his presidency, particularly with Native American communities.

This incident marks a memorable moment in Obama’s presidency, highlighting his ability to connect with diverse cultures while also navigating the traditions of the office. Back in 2013, he had previously acknowledged the rule against wearing headgear, stating, ""You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,"" showcasing his awareness of the unwritten codes that accompany the role. As he continues to engage with various communities, this event serves as a reminder of the importance of cultural appreciation and the bonds formed during his time in office.",17.0,20.0,327.0,1.4166666666666667,0.05198776758409786,328.0,2.2222222222222223,0.06097560975609756

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.

“Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.”

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.”

“We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.

Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”

But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.

“I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.

As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

In a recent interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the profound implications the upcoming election holds for the future of America, asserting it will significantly influence the next 50 years. Clinton's remarks come as the nation gears up for a pivotal electoral period, with just 50 days remaining until voters head to the polls.

During the interview, Clinton made a passionate appeal to black voters, urging them to engage actively in the electoral process. She underscored the importance of participation, stating that every issue crucial to voters is at stake in this election. “The next 50 days will determine our future,” Clinton declared, highlighting the urgency of voter involvement.

Clinton encouraged listeners to check their voter registration status, emphasizing that ensuring they are registered is a vital step in making their voices heard. Her call to action aligns with a broader push for voter participation, echoing sentiments expressed by President Barack Obama, who has also emphasized the significance of various social issues that will be on the ballot this election cycle.

As the election approaches, Clinton anticipates facing aggressive attacks from her opponent, Donald Trump, particularly during the upcoming presidential debate. She expressed her commitment to communicating clearly and fearlessly, despite the expected onslaught of insults and bullying from Trump. “I will not back down in the face of aggression,” Clinton asserted, reinforcing her determination to stand firm against any attempts to undermine her candidacy.

Clinton took a strong stance against Trump’s behavior, condemning his attacks on marginalized groups as intolerable. “We cannot allow this kind of rhetoric to become the norm in our political discourse,” she stated, calling for a more respectful and inclusive dialogue in the political arena.

As Clinton concluded her interview, Trump took to Twitter to mock her, suggesting that she was taking the day off before their upcoming debate. This tweet underscores the contentious atmosphere as both candidates prepare for a showdown that could shape the narrative of the election.

With the stakes higher than ever, Clinton’s call for voter participation resonates strongly as she seeks to mobilize support ahead of the election. Her focus on the importance of every vote reflects a broader concern about the direction of the country and the impact of the electoral choices made in the coming weeks.

As the election draws near, both Clinton and Trump are gearing up for what promises to be a heated and contentious campaign. With critical issues on the ballot, voters are reminded of their power to influence the future of America through their participation in the democratic process. Clinton's emphasis on voter engagement serves as a rallying cry for those who believe that their voices matter in shaping the nation’s trajectory. 

In this high-stakes political environment, the next few weeks will be crucial for both candidates as they navigate the challenges ahead and seek to secure their places in history.",7.0,4.0,524.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013358778625954198,561.0,0.2,0.0071301247771836

This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.

Story Continued Below

So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.

Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.

Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as “another Hitler.” She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.

In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.

That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.

It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin’s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did—an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing Russians,” a doubly illegal act of war.

Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.

***

John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, “Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.” Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.

But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.” Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.”

Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.

“Our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.”

He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. “All this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.”

John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.

The legacy of JFK & RFK is “being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party.”

Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.

Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.

Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.

Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime “existential” threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be “existential” enemy.

There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.

Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.”

Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.

But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.

For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.

And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.

***

So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.

We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.

President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future.

Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.

But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.

Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.

Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “There can be no business as usual with Russia.”

Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.

And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:

Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.

Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.

Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.

This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.

Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.

Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.

Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

In a surprising political turn, Adam Walinsky, a lifelong Democrat and former legislative assistant to the legendary Kennedy brothers, John and Robert, has announced his decision to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. This announcement has sent ripples through political circles, prompting Walinsky to articulate the reasoning behind his significant shift in allegiance.

Walinsky, who has spent decades championing Democratic ideals, feels compelled to explain his departure from the party line. His primary concern revolves around what he perceives as the current Democratic Party's troubling alignment with militarism and war. He argues that the party has strayed from its foundational principles of peace and diplomacy, particularly under the leadership of figures like Hillary Clinton. According to Walinsky, Clinton's advocacy for military interventions and her failure to prioritize peaceful resolutions have contributed to a foreign policy that he believes is detrimental to both the United States and the world.

In stark contrast, Walinsky points to Trump's willingness to engage in dialogue with nations like Russia and China. He views this approach as a necessary strategy in the fight against terrorism, suggesting that open lines of communication are essential for fostering international cooperation and resolving conflicts. While acknowledging that Trump is not without his flaws, Walinsky emphasizes the former president's political courage and his independence from the entrenched war hawks that have dominated Washington's foreign policy landscape.

Reflecting on the legacy of the Kennedy brothers, Walinsky draws a poignant comparison between their commitment to peace efforts and the current state of U.S. foreign policy. He reminisces about a time when the United States sought to lead through diplomacy rather than military might. The Kennedys, he argues, understood the importance of addressing the root causes of conflict and promoting understanding among nations, a stark contrast to what he perceives as the current administration's heavy-handed approach.

Walinsky's critique of the Democratic Party extends beyond foreign policy; he advocates for a shift in focus towards domestic issues that directly impact the lives of American citizens. He argues that the United States should prioritize improving domestic peace and security, particularly by investing in better-trained police forces. In his view, the path to true security lies not in overseas military engagements but in addressing the needs and concerns of communities at home.

Moreover, Walinsky calls for a return to the wisdom of America's founders, urging a reevaluation of national interests that emphasizes cooperation with other nations in the fight against terrorism. He believes that the founding principles of the United States—rooted in diplomacy, mutual respect, and a commitment to peace—should guide contemporary foreign policy decisions. In this context, he argues that Trump's platform resonates with these ideals, presenting a viable alternative to the perpetual cycle of war that has characterized much of recent U.S. foreign engagement.

As Walinsky reflects on his decision, he acknowledges the complexities of modern politics. He understands that his endorsement of Trump may raise eyebrows among his peers and fellow Democrats, but he remains steadfast in his belief that the current trajectory of the Democratic Party is misaligned with the values he holds dear. For Walinsky, the choice to support Trump is not born out of blind allegiance but rather a calculated decision based on a desire for a more peaceful and secure future for the United States.

In conclusion, Adam Walinsky's announcement marks a significant moment in the political landscape, illustrating the potential for ideological shifts even among those with deep-rooted party affiliations. His call for a reevaluation of U.S. foreign policy, a focus on domestic issues, and a commitment to peace reflects a broader conversation about the direction of the Democratic Party and the future of American politics. As the election approaches, Walinsky's endorsement of Trump serves as a reminder that political allegiances can evolve in response to changing circumstances and the urgent need for a new approach to governance.",-120.0,49.0,3840.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.03125,729.0,2.0416666666666665,0.06721536351165981

As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.

Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.

From the Independent Review Journal:

But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:

People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474655224000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer4.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer1.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer2.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer3.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer5.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters."", ""title"": ""NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte - But It Wasn't To Protest The National Anthem... | John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 750, ""identifier"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg"", ""height"": 563}, ""url"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""always"", ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 1631890973779575, ""pages"": 389658314427637}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Black Lives Matter"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-23T14:27:04-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/terresamonroe""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- NC State Troopers took a knee to pray before confronting protesters in Charlotte, contrasting with Colin Kaepernick's protest against police prejudice.

In a powerful display of faith and unity, North Carolina State Troopers took a knee to pray before confronting protesters in Charlotte, a poignant contrast to the high-profile protests against police prejudice sparked by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. This act of devotion has since gained significant attention, with a photo of the officers praying going viral and emphasizing their commitment to faith and God amid a tumultuous atmosphere.

The backdrop of this moment is the officer-involved shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has ignited protests and discussions around police practices and community relations. In the wake of this incident, social media witnessed a different kind of ""taking a knee""—one that centered on prayer rather than protest. This shift highlights a desire for peace and understanding in a time when tensions are high.

Despite the presence of radicals who were reportedly bused into Charlotte with the intention of inciting chaos, the troopers’ act of prayer played a crucial role in maintaining the peace during the protests. The North Carolina Troopers Association shared the impactful photo, which garnered nearly 100,000 shares within just 24 hours. The accompanying caption encouraged thoughts and prayers for the troopers as they worked to protect and serve the city, reinforcing the importance of their mission.

The response to the troopers' prayer was not limited to Charlotte. Individuals across the country, including many in Memphis, also knelt in prayer, showcasing a colorblind faith that transcends racial divides amidst the unrest. This collective act of devotion serves as a reminder of the power of prayer in fostering unity and hope during challenging times.

However, the article does not shy away from addressing the darker elements of the protests. It criticizes violent demonstrators, suggesting they are being manipulated by Marxist ideologies that seek to sow discord rather than promote healing. In contrast, the emphasis on prayer and community support is presented as a more constructive approach to addressing the underlying issues of the protests.

The presence of the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team in Charlotte further underscores the importance of faith during this period of unrest. Their support emphasizes the need for unity and compassion among all individuals, regardless of their backgrounds. The team’s involvement highlights a broader movement towards healing and reconciliation, rather than division.

The author expresses pride in the police officers for their priorities, commending their decision to prioritize prayer over violence. This perspective sharply critiques movements like Black Lives Matter, which the author argues have promoted violence over peaceful expressions of faith and solidarity. In a time when the nation grapples with complex issues of race and justice, the troopers’ act of kneeling in prayer serves as a reminder of the power of faith to bring people together.

As Charlotte continues to navigate the aftermath of the protests, the image of the troopers praying stands as a beacon of hope. It illustrates that even in the face of adversity and division, there is a path toward peace grounded in faith and collective action. The call for unity and understanding amidst the chaos is a message that resonates deeply, encouraging individuals to seek common ground and work together for a brighter future.",3.0,25.0,580.0,0.1,0.005172413793103448,593.0,1.0869565217391304,0.04215851602023609

Real_35-Webpage,Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games.

Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.

Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.

""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.

While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.

During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!""

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

Nonetheless, Rapinoe has no plans of quitting her protest and is willing to risk suspension in order to make a statement.

U.S. women's soccer player Megan Rapinoe may be facing disciplinary action from U.S. Soccer for kneeling during the national anthem. The organization's stance is clear: players and coaches are expected to stand in honor of the anthem, a guideline that Rapinoe has chosen to challenge.

Rapinoe's protest occurred during a match against the Netherlands on September 18, where she knelt to express her dissent against injustice and oppression in the United States. This act of protest aligns with the actions of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who initially sparked a national conversation by kneeling during the anthem to protest police brutality and racial prejudice.

U.S. Soccer has expressed its displeasure with Rapinoe's actions, emphasizing the importance of honoring the flag during the anthem. Although Rapinoe has not faced immediate punishment for her protest, U.S. Soccer has indicated that her situation will be re-evaluated if she continues to kneel in future games.

During the match against the Netherlands, Rapinoe faced backlash from fans, highlighting the divisive nature of her protest. Despite the criticism and potential repercussions, Rapinoe remains steadfast in her commitment to her cause. She has stated that she plans to continue kneeling during the national anthem and is determined to formulate a more effective action plan moving forward.

Rapinoe's decision to kneel has ignited discussions about the intersection of sports, patriotism, and social justice. Her actions have resonated with many who support her stance against systemic injustices, while also drawing ire from those who believe that athletes should adhere to traditional displays of respect during national ceremonies.

As the situation unfolds, the eyes of the sports world will remain on Rapinoe and U.S. Soccer. The implications of her protest extend beyond the soccer field, as they touch on broader societal issues and the responsibilities of athletes as public figures. Rapinoe's willingness to risk suspension for her beliefs underscores her dedication to advocating for change, regardless of the potential consequences.

In a climate where athletes increasingly use their platforms to address social issues, Rapinoe's actions serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and justice. As she navigates the challenges ahead, her commitment to her cause may inspire others to stand up and speak out against injustice in their own ways.",0.0,2.0,421.0,0.0,0.0,426.0,0.125,0.004694835680751174

It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed.

Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing.

Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.

Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.”

Below is the offending post:

“I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??”

After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.

Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people.

Brody Jenner, the son of Caitlyn Jenner and Linda Thompson, has ignited a firestorm of controversy on social media following a provocative Instagram post. In a statement that has stirred significant debate, Jenner asserted that ""not everything is about race,"" while invoking the phrase ""All Lives Matter."" His remarks quickly drew the ire of many on the left, who criticized him for his perspective as a white, straight, cis-gender man.

The backlash was swift and fierce, with numerous liberals taking to Twitter to express their discontent. Critics accused Jenner of being out of touch with the complexities of race relations and the ongoing discussions surrounding systemic inequality. The phrase ""All Lives Matter"" has often been used to dismiss the specific issues faced by marginalized communities, particularly in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, and many felt that Jenner's comments reflected a misunderstanding of these sensitive dynamics.

In response to the criticism, Jenner expressed his frustration with the media coverage surrounding his statements. He emphasized the necessity of complying with police instructions, regardless of one's race, and questioned the rationale behind exiting a vehicle while armed. His comments suggested that clear communication with law enforcement could potentially prevent misunderstandings and dangerous situations.

Despite his attempts to clarify his position, the backlash only intensified. Following the initial uproar, Jenner shared another photo on Instagram that further fueled the anger of his critics. The image, which was perceived as dismissive of the concerns raised by those opposing his views, only added to the already heightened tensions. 

The incident has sparked a broader discussion about the reactions of liberals to controversial statements, with some suggesting that the left is often quick to take offense. This narrative posits that individuals like Jenner, who express opinions that diverge from the mainstream liberal perspective, face disproportionate backlash, especially when their comments touch upon sensitive topics such as race and policing.

As the discourse surrounding Jenner's statements continues to unfold, it raises important questions about the nature of free speech, the complexities of race relations in America, and the challenges of navigating public opinion in an increasingly polarized environment. Whether Jenner’s comments will lead to further dialogue or continue to deepen divisions remains to be seen.

In the midst of the controversy, Jenner's situation serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between expressing personal viewpoints and understanding the broader societal implications of those views. As public figures navigate these challenging waters, the reactions they provoke can often lead to significant discussions about race, identity, and the responsibilities that come with a platform.",-17.0,-22.0,476.0,-0.9444444444444444,-0.03571428571428571,501.0,-1.2222222222222223,-0.043912175648702596

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.”

Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past.

“Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.”

The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].”

Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.”

“I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”

In a recent statement, Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, expressed strong criticism of former President Donald Trump for his refusal to apologize for his involvement in the controversial ""birther"" movement, which questioned the citizenship of former President Barack Obama. Brazile characterized Trump's actions as a ""wound that won't heal,"" a sentiment that reflects the deep-seated racial tensions and painful history that continue to affect America.

During her remarks, Brazile shared a personal and emotional experience from her visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. This visit served as a poignant reminder of her family's struggles, particularly the challenges they faced regarding documentation due to the legacy of slavery. She emphasized the importance of understanding the historical context surrounding her ancestors and the significance of producing documentation, which has often been a source of pain for many African Americans.

Brazile urged Trump to recognize the weight of his words and the historical implications of the birther claims. She pointed out that the lack of documentation faced by her ancestors is a stark reminder of the systemic injustices that have persisted throughout American history. Her appeal was not merely a call for an apology but a request for a deeper understanding of the racial dynamics at play in the nation.

The issue resurfaced prominently during a recent presidential debate, where Trump attempted to deflect responsibility for the birther claims by shifting blame onto Hillary Clinton. He also took credit for pressuring Obama to release his birth certificate, a move that Brazile and many others view as an attempt to rewrite history rather than acknowledge the harm caused by the birther movement.

While Brazile expressed disappointment over Trump's continued remarks regarding the birther issue, she clarified that she does not expect an apology from him. Instead, she lamented the fact that discussions surrounding the birther movement continue to reopen old wounds related to racial pain and animus in the country. For Brazile, the ongoing dialogue about this topic serves as a reminder of the struggles that many individuals and communities face in confronting the legacy of racism and discrimination.

The birther movement has been a contentious topic in American politics, often viewed as a racially charged effort to undermine the legitimacy of Obama's presidency. Critics argue that it was rooted in racial prejudice, leveraging unfounded claims to cast doubt on the first African American president's legitimacy. Brazile's comments underscore the broader implications of this movement and its lasting impact on race relations in the United States.

As the nation continues to grapple with issues of race, identity, and historical accountability, Brazile's call for understanding and healing resonates with many who seek to address the lingering effects of America's racial history. Her poignant reflections serve as a reminder that the past cannot be overlooked, and that acknowledging the pain it has caused is essential for moving forward as a more unified society.

In conclusion, Brazile's critique of Trump highlights the complexities of race in America and the importance of addressing historical injustices. By urging a deeper understanding of the significance of documentation and the historical struggles of African Americans, she advocates for a dialogue that promotes healing rather than division.",-17.0,-29.0,540.0,-1.0,-0.03148148148148148,605.0,-1.45,-0.047933884297520664
Real_38-Webpage,US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike,"(CNN) The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.

Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials.

That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.

Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.

But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

“This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.”

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

“If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.”

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

“That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.”

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

In a bold move that captivated the audience at this year's Emmys, host Jimmy Kimmel took the opportunity to deliver a series of pointed jabs at former President Donald Trump. With a large audience watching, Kimmel's sharp wit and humor highlighted not only the entertainment industry but also the broader implications of Trump's reality TV fame.

Kimmel opened his monologue by poking fun at Hollywood's elite, particularly focusing on the industry's self-congratulatory stance on diversity. He remarked on the irony of the entertainment community celebrating its progress while simultaneously grappling with its own issues related to representation. This commentary resonated with the audience, who appreciated the blend of humor and critique.

The host continued to question the role television played in Trump's political career, humorously suggesting that without the medium, Trump might not have even considered a run for the presidency. Kimmel's remarks turned the spotlight on Trump's rise to fame through reality television, specifically referencing his wife, Melania, as a key figure in that narrative.

Kimmel did not shy away from placing some of the blame for Trump's presidency squarely on the shoulders of Mark Burnett, the creator of ""Celebrity Apprentice."" He argued that Burnett's reality show not only launched Trump's political aspirations but also normalized the presence of reality television in everyday life. Kimmel's commentary struck a chord as he reflected on how the genre has permeated various aspects of culture and politics.

In a particularly humorous twist, Kimmel suggested that if Trump were to win the presidency again, Burnett should be the first person thrown over the wall that Trump famously promised to build. This tongue-in-cheek proposal served to underscore Kimmel's overall message about the absurdity of reality television's influence on serious political matters.

Kimmel's Emmys monologue was a reminder of the intersection of entertainment and politics, showcasing how humor can be used to address significant societal issues. By weaving together critiques of both Trump and Hollywood's approach to diversity, Kimmel not only entertained but also prompted reflection among viewers about the current state of American culture.",13.0,30.0,391.0,0.7222222222222222,0.03324808184143223,399.0,2.142857142857143,0.07518796992481203

Real_41-Webpage,Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business',"During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump’s debate performance Monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.""

Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""

""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'You’re fired.' They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.""

During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way.""

""When you’re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump.

The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart.""

""He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.

""If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord,"" Biden said about the debate. ""What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.""",http://abcn.ws/2d3YEVr,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"Abc News,More Arlette",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382,"{""fb_title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""description"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s debate performance Monday night \u2013- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.\n\""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to..."", ""title"": ""Biden Slams Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business'"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_drexel_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@arlettesaenz"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-slams-donald-trumps-comment-housing-crisis/story?id=42389382"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389382"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:43:23"", ""keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""abcnews, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, housing crisis, 2016, presidential debate""}","- Vice President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's debate performance during a campaign rally in Philadelphia.

Vice President Joe Biden took aim at Donald Trump's recent debate performance during a campaign rally in Philadelphia, expressing strong disapproval of the former president's comments on the housing crisis. Biden questioned Trump's moral compass, suggesting that his remarks reflect a troubling lack of empathy and understanding for the struggles faced by Americans.

During his address, Biden underscored the importance of moral values in leadership, pointing out that previous presidents, including those from the Republican Party, maintained a moral center that aligned with American values and rights. He challenged the crowd to envision a scenario where a leader like Ronald Reagan would endorse the exploitation of individuals suffering from economic hardship, highlighting a stark contrast between Reagan's principles and Trump's current rhetoric.

Biden further argued that Trump lacks the fundamental sensibilities and values that have historically been shared by most American politicians. He referenced Hillary Clinton's assertion that Trump appeared to be anticipating a collapse in the housing market, to which Trump responded that such a situation would be ""good business."" This statement drew Biden's ire, as he emphasized the disconnect between Trump's wealth and the day-to-day struggles of average Americans.

The Vice President also took issue with Trump's claim that not paying taxes is indicative of intelligence, countering that such a viewpoint is fundamentally unfair to the millions of Americans who do fulfill their tax obligations. Biden expressed his anger over Trump's perspective and the broader implications it has for the American public, suggesting that it reflects a disregard for the sacrifices made by hardworking citizens.

In concluding his remarks, Biden made a clear appeal to the electorate, stressing that the upcoming election presents a distinct choice between two fundamentally different visions for America. He lamented what he described as Trump's cynicism towards the American people, urging voters to consider the values and principles that should guide their decision at the polls.

Biden's comments resonate with a growing sentiment among many voters who are concerned about the implications of Trump's approach to leadership. As the campaign heats up, the Vice President's criticisms serve as a reminder of the stakes involved in the upcoming election and the importance of moral integrity in public office. With a focus on empathy and shared values, Biden aims to connect with voters who are seeking a leader that prioritizes the needs and rights of all Americans.",-5.0,-4.0,453.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.011037527593818985,452.0,-0.2857142857142857,-0.008849557522123894
Real_42-Webpage,National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6,"Story highlights Hillary Clinton has a 6-point lead over Donald Trump in a four way race, according to a new poll

Clinton has the edge over Trump on a number of key issues in the poll ahead of the first presidential debate

(CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.

The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.

Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.

Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.

Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament.

Real_43-Webpage,“Public School Forced My Child To,"7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

“Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.”

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

“During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.”

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

“Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.”

It referenced the jihad as,

“a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years.

La Plata High School, a public high school located in Maryland, is facing serious allegations of indoctrinating students with Islamic teachings, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court by John and Melissa Wood. The couple is represented by the Thomas More Law Center, a legal organization that focuses on religious freedom issues.

The lawsuit claims that students at La Plata High School were subjected to a curriculum that included mandatory recitation of the Islamic statement of faith, known as the Shahada, as well as the memorization of the five pillars of Islam. These allegations have raised concerns among parents regarding the appropriateness of the school's religious education practices.

John Wood, one of the plaintiffs, alleges that he was banned from school property after he voiced his concerns about the Islamic curriculum being taught to students. This action has drawn attention to the broader implications of the school's educational policies and their impact on students' understanding of different religions.

According to the lawsuit, the educational materials used at La Plata High School led students to regard the Muslim faith as superior to both Christianity and Judaism. This assertion has sparked outrage among some parents and community members, who argue that the school should provide a balanced view of all religions rather than promoting one over another.

The lawsuit names several individuals and entities, including Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and the Charles County Board of Education. It claims that the school failed to adequately teach Christianity and included disparaging remarks about the religion, which has raised questions about the fairness and objectivity of the school's curriculum.

Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges that classroom materials suggested that most Muslims possess a stronger faith than the average Christian, which could lead to misunderstandings and misrepresentations of both faiths among students. The materials reportedly described jihad as a religious duty and included messages that emphasized the peaceful nature of Islam, raising concerns about the portrayal of Islamic teachings in the classroom.

The events detailed in the lawsuit reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year, and the ramifications of these allegations are still unfolding. The case has drawn attention from various advocacy groups, although neither the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) nor the Freedom From Religion Foundation has commented on the matter at this time.

As the lawsuit progresses, it is likely to spark further debate about the role of public education in teaching religious beliefs and the balance that must be struck to ensure that students receive a comprehensive and unbiased education. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for how religious teachings are integrated into school curricula across the country and may influence policies regarding religious education in public schools. 

With the spotlight on La Plata High School and its curriculum, the community waits to see how the legal proceedings will unfold and what impact they may have on the future of religious education in Maryland.",-5.0,-10.0,511.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.009784735812133072,543.0,-0.5882352941176471,-0.01841620626151013

Real_47-Webpage,KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism,"“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can’t I?

In a recent interview with TMZ, rock icon Gene Simmons, famed for his role in the legendary band KISS, shared his controversial views on terrorism and profiling, igniting discussions among fans and critics alike. Known for his larger-than-life persona, Simmons did not hold back when addressing the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the NY/NJ bomber. He boldly stated that Rahami ""should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend,"" showcasing his characteristic blend of humor and seriousness.

Simmons, who has garnered a following among conservative audiences, particularly NASCAR fans, used the platform to advocate for increased profiling in the fight against Islamic terrorism. He emphasized the need for a more proactive approach, declaring, ""Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling."" His remarks reflect a growing sentiment among some public figures who believe that profiling could be a key strategy in enhancing national security.

The rock star further elaborated on his stance, asserting that profiling is a necessary measure during wartime. He even went as far as to say he would be willing to accept being profiled himself, underscoring his commitment to the cause. When confronted with the issue of unfair profiling, Simmons acknowledged the potential for injustice, stating, “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist.” His candid remarks have sparked debate about the ethics and implications of profiling in contemporary society.

Amidst the serious nature of the discussion, the article humorously speculated about the possibility of Simmons being appointed as the director of Homeland Security should Donald Trump ascend to the presidency. While this notion may seem far-fetched, it reflects the often unpredictable intersection of celebrity culture and politics in today’s world.

As the conversation around terrorism and national security continues to evolve, Simmons’ comments serve as a reminder of the diverse opinions that exist within the public sphere, particularly from those in the entertainment industry. Whether one agrees with his views or not, Simmons undeniably remains a powerful voice in contemporary discourse.",12.0,4.0,381.0,0.5714285714285714,0.031496062992125984,402.0,0.26666666666666666,0.009950248756218905
Real_48-Webpage,"Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'","(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""

""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""

Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.

Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.

Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.

""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""

""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""

""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""

Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016

In response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.

Danny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.",http://cnn.it/2cQyS4N,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,"Dan Merica,Eugene Scott",http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161118161709-cop-punches-woman-in-face-thumb-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718110446-02-officer-mohamed-noor-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717224427-justine-ruszczyk-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170711043320-georgia-police-beating-jnd-orig-vstop-00000612-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170104090632-north-carolina-school-body-slam-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170720014308-baltimore-pd-body-cam-video-release-02-large-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170626185531-jordan-edwards-roy-oliver-split-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712182221-florida-state-attorney-aramis-ayala-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170818111936-dashcam-video-ohio-violent-arrest-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160707080401-philando-castile-facebook-2-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520225617-georgia-man-tased-death-police-pkg-00012201-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717113139-australian-woman-minneapolis-police-shooting-nr-00000812-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718090944-betsy-hodges-7-18-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712054244-louisiana-couple-police-shooting-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160428084627-baltimore-teen-replica-gun-shot-dnt-00001823-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html,"{""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""author"": ""Eugene Scott and Dan Merica, CNN"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-col,col-controversial-police-incidents-"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Election 2016, US election, Tulsa, shooting, politics, Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable' - CNNPolitics"", ""article"": {""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202""}, ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-21T14:20:33Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced plans to prevent police-involved shootings.

In a bold announcement, Robby Mook, campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, outlined a comprehensive strategy aimed at preventing police-involved shootings and addressing the broader issues of systemic racism within law enforcement. The plan comes in response to a series of high-profile incidents of police violence, including the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Clinton's approach to reforming police practices consists of two primary components. The first involves establishing national standards for managing police situations, which aims to improve training for officers and ultimately prevent incidents of violence. By implementing uniform protocols across the nation, the campaign seeks to create a safer environment for both police officers and the communities they serve.

The second component focuses on fostering better relationships between police departments and minority communities. Clinton advocates for community policing initiatives and increased investment in resources that can help bridge the gap between law enforcement and the citizens they protect. Through these efforts, the campaign hopes to cultivate trust and understanding, which are essential for effective policing.

In the wake of the Crutcher shooting, Clinton condemned what she described as ""systematic racism,"" highlighting the urgent need for reforms in the criminal justice system. Her remarks come amid ongoing protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, where demonstrations erupted following the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. These protests have resulted in injuries to approximately 12 police officers, underscoring the heightened tensions surrounding issues of race and policing in America.

Clinton's campaign takes a proactive stance on addressing implicit bias, particularly among white audiences. She plans to engage in direct conversations about the unequal treatment faced by minority communities within the criminal justice system. Acknowledging that while many police officers are dedicated to their communities, Clinton emphasized that systemic change is necessary to address the root causes of these disparities.

The former Secretary of State described the repeated incidents of police violence as ""unbearable,"" calling for immediate action to confront systemic racism. Her campaign's commitment to change reflects a growing recognition of the need for accountability and reform in policing practices across the United States.

In addition to her campaign's proposed measures, investigations are currently underway by the Department of Justice and state authorities to assess potential civil rights violations related to the Crutcher shooting. These investigations aim to provide transparency and accountability in the wake of the tragedy, further highlighting the importance of addressing the issues of police violence and systemic racism.

As the nation grapples with these critical issues, Clinton's campaign seeks to position itself as a leader in the fight for justice and equality. By advocating for national standards in policing and fostering community relationships, the campaign aims to create a safer and more equitable society for all citizens.

The conversation surrounding police-involved shootings and systemic racism is more relevant than ever, and Clinton's plans reflect a commitment to tackling these challenges head-on. With ongoing protests and public outcry for justice, the urgency for reform has never been clearer.

As the campaign progresses, Clinton's approach may influence the national dialogue on policing and race relations, shaping the future of law enforcement policies in America. The proposed reforms have the potential to create meaningful change, addressing the concerns of communities affected by police violence while also supporting the dedicated officers committed to serving and protecting their neighborhoods.

In conclusion, Robby Mook's announcement of Hillary Clinton's plans to prevent police-involved shootings and combat systemic racism underscores a critical moment in the national conversation on race and policing. With a focus on training, community engagement, and addressing implicit bias, Clinton's campaign aims to pave the way for a more just and equitable future in law enforcement. As investigations continue and protests persist, the call for action remains urgent, and the need for systemic change is clear.",-5.0,-20.0,656.0,-0.14705882352941177,-0.007621951219512195,723.0,-0.7407407407407407,-0.027662517289073305
Real_49-Webpage,Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked,"Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked

Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager.

Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative.

Story Continued Below

“He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?”

Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.

Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.”

“So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked.

“You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.

In a highly anticipated debate against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump is prepared to share his plan to combat the Islamic State, should the topic arise. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, confirmed that the Republican nominee possesses a detailed strategy aimed at defeating the militant group.

Conway took the opportunity to criticize Clinton for openly sharing her own ISIS plan on her campaign website, suggesting that such transparency may not be in the best interest of national security. ""Donald Trump has a different approach,"" she stated, emphasizing that he intends to keep certain specifics under wraps to maintain an advantage over the enemy.

While Trump has previously made bold statements about his intentions to ""knock the hell out of ISIS,"" he has yet to provide concrete details about his proposed tactics. Conway reassured voters that they will gain insight into Trump's overall approach during the debate, while also ensuring that he will not reveal sensitive information that could compromise his strategy against the terrorist organization.

The debate presents a crucial opportunity for Trump to articulate his vision for national security and counterterrorism efforts. As the election draws nearer, the contrasting approaches of the candidates regarding ISIS and broader foreign policy issues are likely to be a focal point for voters. 

Conway's remarks underscore the delicate balance Trump aims to strike between informing the public and safeguarding his plans from potential adversaries. The upcoming debate promises to be a pivotal moment for both candidates as they seek to persuade voters on their respective strategies for addressing the ongoing threat posed by ISIS.",-11.0,7.0,331.0,-1.1,-0.03323262839879154,303.0,0.7,0.0231023102310231

Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists.

During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear.

""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.""

""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens.

In a poignant address during his final United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, President Obama reassured Americans in the wake of recent attempts at mass violence. He emphasized that succumbing to fear only serves to benefit terrorists, urging the nation to remain steadfast in its values and way of life.

The President commended the swift actions of law enforcement following bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. These decisive responses played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of the incidents, and Obama praised the bravery and efficiency of the first responders involved.

As investigations continued in Chelsea, where a bomb explosion injured dozens, Obama highlighted the importance of resilience in the face of adversity. He called upon citizens not to allow fear to disrupt their daily lives or undermine their core values. ""We must not let fear dictate our actions or beliefs,"" he stated, reinforcing the notion that unity and strength are essential in overcoming challenges posed by acts of violence.

In his remarks, the President particularly recognized the toughness and resolve of the residents of New York and New Jersey, presenting their response to the recent attacks as a model for the entire nation. This resilience, he argued, is a testament to the American spirit and a critical component in the ongoing fight against terror.

Obama's address served not only as a reassurance to the public but also as a call to action, encouraging Americans to stand firm in their convictions and to support one another in these trying times. As the nation grapples with the aftermath of violence, his message of hope and strength resonates profoundly, reminding all that together, they can rise above fear and adversity.",-6.0,-1.0,331.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.01812688821752266,326.0,-0.09090909090909091,-0.003067484662576687
Real_50-Webpage,Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity,"United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.

The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.

At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.

""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.

Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""

JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45

""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.

""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""

The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.

A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.

Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.

""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""

Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.

""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.

""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.

The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.

""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement.

But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.

""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.""

The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.

The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.

""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""

Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.

""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.""

But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.

""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""

As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.

The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.

Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.

And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp.

""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said.",http://cnn.it/2deTou2,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg,Laura Koran,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920104405-02-obama-un-0920-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920152131-obama-united-nations-general-assembly-origwx-bw-00000210-exlarge-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160920093742-obama-leaders-collage-edited-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html,"{""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""author"": ""Laura Koran"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T16:16:28Z"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,art-vid"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""politics, Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity - CNNPolitics"", ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-20T22:23:38Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919171855-berm-camp-2-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \""of epic proportions,\"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}","- President Obama urged countries to address the global refugee crisis during a speech at the United Nations.

In a powerful address at the United Nations, President Barack Obama urged nations around the world to confront the escalating global refugee crisis. The speech coincided with the convening of a Leaders' Summit on Refugees, an event designed to shine a spotlight on the dire circumstances faced by tens of millions of displaced individuals. The summit served as a platform for world leaders to discuss collaborative efforts to alleviate the suffering of refugees and to promote a more compassionate approach to addressing their challenges.

During his remarks, Obama underscored the urgent need for collective action in response to what he described as both a humanitarian and security challenge. He specifically highlighted the ""unacceptable"" situation in Syria, where an estimated 4.8 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to ongoing conflict. The president's comments reflect a broader recognition of the significant toll that war and violence take on civilian populations, particularly in regions experiencing protracted crises.

The refugee crisis is not a new phenomenon, but its scale has reached unprecedented levels. According to a report from the United Nations, approximately 65.3 million people were displaced globally in 2015, with 21.3 million classified as refugees. This staggering figure underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for comprehensive international responses.

In addressing the complexities of the refugee crisis, Obama drew historical parallels to past failures of global action. He referenced the tragic example of Jews fleeing Nazi Germany, a poignant reminder of the consequences of inaction in the face of human suffering. His remarks served as a call to conscience for world leaders, encouraging them to learn from history and to act decisively to prevent further humanitarian disasters.

The Leaders' Summit on Refugees aimed to advance several key objectives, including increasing funding for humanitarian efforts, enhancing resettlement opportunities, and improving access to education and work rights for refugees. These initiatives are vital for ensuring that displaced individuals can rebuild their lives and contribute to the communities that welcome them. However, despite the hopeful commitments made during the summit, many aid organizations expressed skepticism regarding the likelihood of meaningful action resulting from the discussions.

In a significant move to bolster its commitment to the refugee crisis, the United States announced plans to increase its refugee intake from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 in 2017. This decision reflects a recognition of the urgent need for resettlement options for those fleeing violence and persecution. However, the Obama administration faces considerable challenges in garnering congressional support for expanding refugee support and resources. The political landscape surrounding immigration and refugee policies remains contentious, with opposition from various factions complicating efforts to provide adequate assistance.

Globally, humanitarian contributions have seen an increase, with 32 donor countries collectively raising approximately $4.5 billion more in 2016 compared to the previous year. This uptick in funding is a positive development, but the scale of the refugee crisis necessitates sustained and increased support to meet the needs of displaced populations effectively. The financial contributions are crucial for providing essential services, including healthcare, education, and shelter for refugees, particularly in regions that are already grappling with their own economic challenges.

The impact of the refugee crisis is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where resources are often scarce, and infrastructure may be lacking. Countries such as South Sudan have recently joined the ranks of nations with over 1 million refugees, exacerbating the strain on already vulnerable systems. As the number of displaced individuals continues to rise, the international community must prioritize support for these countries, which bear a disproportionate burden in hosting refugees.

For many refugees, particularly those fleeing protracted conflicts, life in camps has become a harsh reality. Many have spent years, if not their entire lives, in these temporary shelters, often lacking access to basic necessities and opportunities for self-sufficiency. The psychological toll of such prolonged displacement can be devastating, as individuals and families grapple with uncertainty and loss.

In conclusion, President Obama's call to action at the United Nations serves as a critical reminder of the moral imperative to address the global refugee crisis. The Leaders' Summit on Refugees provided an opportunity for world leaders to come together and commit to meaningful solutions, but the path forward remains fraught with challenges. As the number of displaced individuals continues to grow, it is essential for nations to prioritize compassion over fear, fostering an environment that supports the dignity and rights of all refugees. The time for action is now, and the world must respond collectively to ensure that the plight of millions is met with the urgency and empathy it deserves.",-13.0,-13.0,1293.0,-0.325,-0.010054137664346482,862.0,-0.40625,-0.015081206496519721
Real_51-Webpage,Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings,"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues

It's a recurring theme of his campaign

Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions.

The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law.

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.

""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

Real_52-Webpage,In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism,"Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of ‘He Said/She Said’ Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.

The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.

But the ""he said/she said"" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics.

Story Continued Below

While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?

In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.

Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.

But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.

As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both ""he said and she said""—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.

One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?

I don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.

The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.

Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.

Obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.

The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.”

Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.

The last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”

If you’re not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.

In recent years, the landscape of political journalism has undergone significant scrutiny, particularly regarding the ""he said/she said"" approach that has long been a staple of news reporting. This method, which aims to present two sides of every story, has faced mounting criticism since 2009, notably from New York University professor Jay Rosen. Advocates for change argue that this approach is outdated and fails to adequately address the complexities of political dishonesty, especially in an era where misinformation is rampant.

The debate surrounding this journalistic style gained mainstream attention when the New York Times published a notable article by journalist Michael Barbaro, who boldly labeled then-President Donald Trump a liar concerning his ""birther"" claims. This marked a departure from the traditional ""he said/she said"" format, which often refrained from making definitive statements about the veracity of public figures' claims. Critics of the conventional method, including political commentator Peter Beinart, hailed this shift as a significant change in journalism. They argued that it better reflects the reality of political discourse, where lies and misinformation can have serious consequences for democratic processes.

However, the implications of moving away from the ""he said/she said"" model are complex. Critics of this shift caution that reducing political journalism to simplistic truth-value assessments could harm the depth and nuance of reporting. Rosen contends that the pursuit of balance can inadvertently create a false equivalence between truthful statements and outright lies. This, he argues, undermines the integrity of journalism and can mislead the public about the nature of political discourse.

A key point in this ongoing discussion is the ways in which Trump has manipulated the ""he said/she said"" format to skew political discourse. His administration has often relied on this journalistic approach to propagate falsehoods, with many of his lies going unchallenged in media coverage. This manipulation has raised concerns about the effectiveness of traditional reporting methods in holding powerful figures accountable.

Despite the criticisms, there are those who defend the ""he said/she said"" approach. Proponents argue that this style promotes open inquiry and ensures that minority viewpoints are represented in the media landscape. This representation can lead to paradigm shifts in understanding complex issues. Historical examples in the realm of science illustrate how dissenting voices have led to significant advancements and corrections of prevailing beliefs. The discourse surrounding climate change, for instance, has evolved dramatically due to the inclusion of diverse perspectives, even those that were initially deemed incorrect.

The argument for maintaining the ""he said/she said"" format rests on the belief that every perspective, even incorrect ones, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of issues. This approach allows for a broader discussion and invites audiences to engage critically with the information presented. In an era marked by polarized media consumption, the need for balanced views becomes even more critical. The challenge lies in ensuring that journalistic standards are upheld while also adapting to the changing dynamics of political communication.

Ultimately, the conclusion drawn from this examination is that ""he said/she said"" journalism, despite its flaws, plays a crucial role in fostering honest discourse and understanding in society. While it may not be perfect, this approach encourages a dialogue that is essential for a functioning democracy. As the media landscape continues to evolve, the challenge for journalists will be to strike a balance between presenting diverse viewpoints and holding public figures accountable for their statements. In doing so, they can contribute to a more informed and engaged citizenry, capable of navigating the complexities of modern political discourse.",6.0,1.0,2265.0,0.06593406593406594,0.0026490066225165563,675.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0014814814814814814
Real_53-Webpage,Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. […] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”

Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has come under intense scrutiny following the tragic death of an inmate, Terrill Thomas, who died in custody under circumstances that have raised serious concerns about jail conditions. Thomas, 38, was found dead on April 24, nine days after his arrest, with reports indicating he had begged for water prior to his death. 

The Milwaukee County medical examiner ruled Thomas’ death a homicide due to profound dehydration, attributing it to the actions of another person. Inmates have reported that the water supply in Thomas' cell was cut off for six days, and one inmate had even alerted jail staff to the potential risk to his life. This alarming revelation has prompted calls for accountability and raised questions about the management of the jail under Clarke's command.

Attorney Erik J. Heipt, who is representing Thomas' family, disclosed that he received calls from other inmates reporting similar issues regarding access to water. He noted that this was not an isolated incident, referencing a previous case where another inmate died under comparable circumstances in 2011.

Clarke, who has frequently appeared on Fox News to criticize the Black Lives Matter movement, has drawn parallels between the movement and international terrorists. He is a staunch supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and has actively participated in pro-Trump initiatives, including a bus tour organized by a supporting super PAC. Clarke garnered significant media attention when he spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention.

Financially, Clarke has also benefited from his public persona, reportedly earning over $150,000 in 2015 from speaking fees, travel reimbursements, and gifts. However, the focus now remains on the troubling circumstances surrounding Thomas’ death and the implications it has for the Milwaukee County Jail's management practices.

As calls for justice and reform grow louder, the Milwaukee community is left grappling with the consequences of leadership that some believe has failed to protect the most vulnerable individuals in its care.",-25.0,-23.0,375.0,-1.9230769230769231,-0.06666666666666667,378.0,-1.7692307692307692,-0.06084656084656084

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?”

In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

“I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

In a recent interview with CNN, Janet Brown, the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), made headlines with her controversial assertion that fact-checking should not play a role in presidential debates. This statement has sparked considerable debate and raised questions about the integrity of the electoral process, particularly as the nation approaches another pivotal election season.

Brown's comments came as part of a broader discussion regarding the responsibilities of moderators during presidential debates. She pointed out the inherent complexities in distinguishing between ""big facts"" and ""little facts,"" suggesting that different sources may yield conflicting information. This perspective has drawn criticism from journalists and political analysts alike, who argue that the role of moderators should include ensuring that candidates are held accountable for their statements.

The implications of Brown's stance align closely with the desires of the Trump campaign, which has long advocated for a debate environment devoid of fact-checking. Supporters of former President Donald Trump have expressed enthusiasm over this development, viewing it as a strategic advantage that could bolster his campaign. The absence of fact-checking is perceived as beneficial for Trump, whose history of frequent misrepresentation has been well-documented.

Indeed, the frequency with which Trump has been reported to lie is striking. According to a report by Politico, Trump has been noted to make false statements approximately every 3 minutes and 15 seconds while on the campaign trail. These misrepresentations cover a wide array of topics, including contentious issues such as the Iraq War, health care policy, and crime rates. The consistent pattern of misinformation raises concerns about the potential impact on voter perception and public discourse.

A comparison of lying frequency between Trump and his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, reveals a stark contrast. Trump's rate of falsehoods significantly surpasses that of Clinton, highlighting a potential double standard in the treatment of candidates during debates. This disparity has led journalists to voice their frustration over the CPD's decision to eschew fact-checking, emphasizing the need for moderators to provide clarity and accuracy in an increasingly polarized political landscape.

As the electoral landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Brown's comments cannot be understated. Critics argue that allowing candidates to make unchecked statements could undermine the democratic process, leading to a misinformed electorate. The role of fact-checking in debates has traditionally served as a safeguard against misinformation, ensuring that voters have access to accurate information as they make crucial decisions at the ballot box.

The CPD's decision to forgo fact-checking has reignited discussions about the responsibilities of moderators in upholding the integrity of presidential debates. Many journalists have raised concerns about the effectiveness of moderators if they are not tasked with fact-checking candidates' statements. Without this critical function, the potential for misinformation to spread unchecked becomes a pressing concern, particularly in an era where social media amplifies false narratives at an unprecedented rate.

Supporters of Trump, however, view the lack of fact-checking as an opportunity to present their candidate's message without the interference of scrutiny. They argue that the current political climate is rife with bias from mainstream media and that a fact-check-free debate environment allows for a more authentic exchange of ideas. This sentiment reflects a broader trend among some voters who have grown disillusioned with traditional media outlets and their role in shaping public discourse.

The debate over fact-checking in presidential debates is emblematic of a larger struggle within American politics, where the lines between truth and misinformation are increasingly blurred. As candidates navigate this complex landscape, the decisions made by organizations like the CPD will have lasting implications for the nature of political discourse in the United States.

As the nation gears up for the upcoming election, the question remains: what role should fact-checking play in presidential debates? Janet Brown's comments have opened the door to a contentious dialogue about the responsibilities of moderators and the importance of maintaining a factual basis for political discussions. In an era where misinformation can spread like wildfire, the need for accountability and transparency in political debates has never been more critical.

In conclusion, the CPD's decision to eliminate fact-checking from presidential debates has sparked a significant backlash from journalists and political observers who fear the consequences of allowing unchecked statements to dominate the discourse. As voters prepare to make informed choices, the absence of fact-checking raises fundamental questions about the integrity of the electoral process and the role of truth in American democracy.",11.0,-17.0,839.0,0.3235294117647059,0.013110846245530394,828.0,-0.5483870967741935,-0.020531400966183576

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.

“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.

“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

In the aftermath of the highly anticipated debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, a senior advisor to Trump's campaign, has publicly praised the Republican candidate for his restraint and composure throughout the evening. Conway's comments come as the political landscape continues to shift in the lead-up to the election, with both candidates vying for the attention and support of undecided voters.

During the debate, Trump faced a barrage of criticisms from Clinton, particularly regarding his past derogatory remarks about women. However, Conway expressed her admiration for Trump's decision to hold back from retaliating against Clinton's comments. ""He showed remarkable restraint,"" Conway remarked, underscoring the significance of this choice in the context of the heated political climate.

Conway noted that Trump opted not to make a rough comment, particularly considering that Clinton's family was present in the audience. This decision, she argued, demonstrated a level of respect and decorum that is often lacking in political debates. ""He was prepared to make a strong attack, but he chose to consider the audience and the implications of his words,"" Conway stated, emphasizing the strategic nature of Trump's approach.

While some may have expected Trump to capitalize on Clinton's past, particularly regarding her husband's record with women, Conway pointed out that he refrained from doing so. This choice, she suggested, was indicative of Trump's desire to maintain a higher ground during the debate. ""He could have brought up Bill Clinton's record, but he chose not to,"" she said, framing this decision as a testament to Trump's focus on the broader issues at hand rather than engaging in personal attacks.

In contrast, Conway was critical of Clinton's performance throughout the debate. She argued that Clinton failed to deliver a significant ""knockout punch"" that could have swayed undecided voters. Instead, Conway described Clinton's demeanor as overly rehearsed, focused on delivering pre-prepared talking points rather than engaging in a genuine dialogue with the audience. ""It felt like she was going through the motions, rather than actually connecting with the voters,"" Conway observed.

This critique of Clinton's approach raises questions about her effectiveness in reaching out to those seeking change in the political landscape. Conway expressed skepticism about Clinton's ability to resonate with voters who are looking for a fresh perspective and a break from the status quo. ""If she wants to connect with the people, she needs to step away from the script and speak to their concerns directly,"" she advised.

The debate has sparked discussions about the contrasting styles of both candidates. While Trump’s approach was characterized by a calculated restraint, Clinton's performance was perceived by some as lacking spontaneity and authenticity. Conway's analysis suggests that this dynamic could play a crucial role in shaping voter perceptions as the election draws nearer.

As the political narrative continues to unfold, Conway's remarks highlight the importance of both strategy and presentation in debates. The ability to connect with voters, while also maintaining a poised demeanor, is a delicate balance that both candidates must navigate. With the election fast approaching, the implications of this debate may resonate with voters as they make their decisions at the polls.

In conclusion, Kellyanne Conway's praise for Donald Trump's restraint during the debate against Hillary Clinton underscores a pivotal moment in the ongoing electoral battle. By choosing not to retaliate against Clinton's criticisms and refraining from personal attacks, Trump has positioned himself as a candidate who, despite his controversial past, is capable of rising above the fray. Meanwhile, Clinton's performance raises questions about her ability to engage with voters in a meaningful way. As both candidates continue their campaigns, the lessons learned from this debate will likely play a significant role in shaping their strategies moving forward.",5.0,26.0,650.0,0.35714285714285715,0.007692307692307693,736.0,0.9285714285714286,0.035326086956521736

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

[A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,,https://www.washingtonpost.com,{'$date': 1474243200000},,"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg&w=60,https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,"{""theme"": ""normal"", ""news_keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Washington Post"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste."", ""title"": ""France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery"", ""url"": ""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""image"": ""https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""unsafe-url"", ""twitter"": {""site"": ""@WashingtonPost"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""creator"": ""jameskmcauley""}, ""object-hash"": 1503984085, ""robots"": ""index,follow"", ""apple-itunes-app"": ""app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 500835072, ""app_id"": 41245586762}, ""keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste.""}","- France has become the first country to ban plastic plates, cups, and utensils, effective in 2020.

In a significant environmental move, France has become the first country to implement a ban on plastic plates, cups, and utensils, effective from 2020. This groundbreaking legislation is part of the broader Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, which aims to address pressing environmental concerns and promote sustainable practices. The law also includes provisions to prohibit plastic bags in grocery stores starting in July, further solidifying France's commitment to reducing plastic waste.

The ban allows for exceptions when it comes to items made from compostable or biosourced materials. This flexibility acknowledges the need for alternatives that can mitigate the environmental impact associated with conventional plastics. The overarching goal of the legislation is to foster a ""circular economy"" of waste disposal, emphasizing the importance of product design and recycling in reducing the overall footprint of plastic consumption.

Plastic pollution has become a global crisis, with the material failing to biodegrade and instead breaking down into harmful particles that pose significant risks to wildlife, particularly in ocean ecosystems. The detrimental effects of plastic on marine life are well-documented, prompting urgent calls for action from governments and environmental organizations around the world.

Moreover, the manufacturing of plastic is a major contributor to climate change, as it relies heavily on the use of millions of barrels of oil each year. This connection between plastic production and environmental degradation has been a driving force behind France's legislative efforts. French President François Hollande has underscored the importance of the ban as part of a larger strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of renewable energy sources.

Despite the ambitious nature of the ban, it has not been without controversy. Some critics argue that the legislation infringes upon European Union laws regarding the free movement of goods and the protections afforded to manufacturers. Eamonn Bates, a representative of Pack2Go Europe, has expressed intentions to challenge the ban, urging the European Commission to take legal action against France. This opposition highlights the tension between national environmental policies and EU regulations, raising questions about the future of similar initiatives across Europe.

Supporters of the ban initially sought to implement the restrictions sooner than 2020. However, concerns regarding the potential impact on low-income families led to a postponement of the timeline. This decision reflects the complexities involved in balancing environmental goals with social equity, as lawmakers strive to ensure that the transition away from plastic does not disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

As France moves forward with this landmark legislation, it sets a precedent for other nations to follow suit in the fight against plastic pollution. The ban on single-use plastics marks a crucial step toward creating a more sustainable future and encourages other countries to consider similar measures. The global community watches closely as France navigates the challenges and opportunities presented by this ambitious environmental initiative, which aims to reshape consumption patterns and promote a greener economy.",-14.0,-6.0,529.0,-0.8235294117647058,-0.026465028355387523,540.0,-0.2857142857142857,-0.011111111111111112
Real_57-Webpage,Paul Ryan ducks on stop-and-frisk,"Story highlights Ryan called for calm in Charlotte, but would not comment on Trump's ""stop and frisk"" proposals

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump.

""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,"" Ryan said.

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.

But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.

What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.

The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said.

As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first?

Charlotte, North Carolina, has become the epicenter of unrest following the shooting of a black man, Keith Lamont Scott, by local police. The incident has sparked widespread speculation and anger, leading to riots that have engulfed the city in chaos. Demonstrators took to the streets, expressing their frustrations through looting, theft, and even the shutdown of major thoroughfares like I-85.

The narrative surrounding Scott's death has painted him as an innocent individual, engaged in charitable acts prior to the confrontation with law enforcement. This portrayal has resonated with many in the community, intensifying calls for justice and accountability. However, the police's account of the events has raised questions about the circumstances leading to the shooting and whether their perspective is being adequately considered amidst the escalating unrest.

In response to the growing tensions, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney held a news conference to address the incident. Chief Putney explained that officers were actively searching for a suspect when they encountered Scott exiting a vehicle while armed with a handgun. According to the Chief, officers instructed Scott to drop the weapon, but he exited the vehicle a second time still holding the firearm.

Chief Putney asserted that Scott posed a significant threat to the officers, thereby justifying their decision to use lethal force. The Chief's remarks aimed to clarify the police's actions and the rationale behind them, emphasizing that the situation was more complex than the narrative being circulated on social media platforms.

Moreover, Chief Putney expressed concern about the misrepresentation of the incident and the need to shift the narrative surrounding it. He suggested that the portrayal of the events may have been skewed, contributing to the unrest and misunderstanding of law enforcement's actions. This perspective highlights a broader critique of how critics, particularly those without relevant experience in law enforcement, interpret and respond to police actions during volatile situations.

As the city continues to grapple with the aftermath of Scott's shooting, the divide between law enforcement and community members appears to widen. The riots have not only disrupted daily life in Charlotte but have also ignited a larger conversation about race, policing, and accountability in America. In the face of growing unrest, the question remains: can dialogue and understanding bridge the gap between the police and the communities they serve?

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the complexities involved in police-community relations, particularly in the context of racial tensions. As protests continue and emotions run high, the need for constructive dialogue and a thorough examination of the events leading to Scott's death has never been more pressing. The community seeks answers, while law enforcement grapples with the implications of their actions in a fraught environment.

In the coming days, as the city of Charlotte attempts to restore calm and order, the focus will likely remain on the relationship between law enforcement and the community. The aftermath of Scott's shooting could serve as a catalyst for change or exacerbate existing divides, depending on how both sides choose to engage in the dialogue moving forward. The events in Charlotte are a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for justice and understanding in the realm of policing and race relations in America.",-23.0,-14.0,562.0,-0.9583333333333334,-0.04092526690391459,609.0,-0.6086956521739131,-0.022988505747126436

ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June.

The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

""The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,"" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. ""As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.""

Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.

Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.

Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.

Real_6-Webpage,Obama weighs in on the debate,"Obama weighs in on the debate

President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change.

The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.”

And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.”

The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both.

""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012

""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,"" Obama said, ""that worries me.""

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is ""naturally occurring.""

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, former President Barack Obama has reiterated his critical stance on Donald Trump, emphasizing concerns about the Republican candidate's preparedness and temperament for the highest office in the land. Obama articulated his belief that Trump is ill-equipped to manage serious global threats, particularly those involving nuclear weapons and climate change.

During a public appearance, Obama expressed his apprehension regarding Trump's ability to handle pressing issues that could impact future generations. He underscored the gravity of nuclear proliferation and the urgent need to combat climate change, suggesting that Trump's approach could jeopardize the safety and well-being of the nation and the planet.

In stark contrast, Obama praised Hillary Clinton's performance during the debate, highlighting her qualifications and readiness to assume the presidency. He pointed out that Clinton embodies the core values of inclusion and opportunity, which he believes are essential for effective leadership. According to Obama, Trump's lack of these values raises serious questions about his suitability for the role of president.

Obama also took aim at Trump's foreign policy positions, particularly regarding the United States' commitments to Japan and South Korea. He suggested that Trump does not fully grasp the complexities of these alliances, which are vital for maintaining stability in the region. This critique aligns with Obama's broader concerns about Trump's understanding of critical international relationships.

The former president further referenced a controversial tweet from Trump in 2012, in which the businessman dismissed climate change as a ""hoax"" purportedly created by China. Obama pointed out that this view stands in stark contrast to the overwhelming scientific consensus on the reality and urgency of climate change, which he believes necessitates immediate action.

In response to Obama’s remarks, Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended her candidate by stating that Trump believes climate change is ""naturally occurring."" This response, however, has not alleviated Obama’s concerns, as he continues to advocate for a proactive approach to environmental issues.

As the election approaches, Obama’s critique of Trump underscores the stark differences between the two candidates, particularly in their approaches to governance and global challenges. With the stakes higher than ever, Obama’s comments serve as a reminder of the critical decisions voters will face in the upcoming election.",-7.0,-2.0,419.0,-0.5833333333333334,-0.016706443914081145,444.0,-0.125,-0.0045045045045045045
Real_60-Webpage,How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying “yes” to Fox News almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning, he is booked on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn’t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

In a notable shift from his previous media engagement tactics, Donald Trump has recently concentrated his public appearances primarily on Fox News, a move that raises questions about his broader electoral strategy. Historically, Trump has been known for his open and accessible approach to media interviews, which has played a significant role in bolstering his political candidacy. However, his current strategy seems to pivot away from reaching undecided voters, focusing instead on energizing his existing base.

Trump's recent appearances on Fox News programs, including ""Fox & Friends"" and ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" have become a staple of his media outreach. Additionally, he has a town hall scheduled with Sean Hannity, indicating a deliberate choice to align closely with a network that has been supportive of his agenda. This concentrated approach allows Trump to present his narrative without the scrutiny often associated with other major news outlets.

By primarily engaging with Fox News, Trump can sidestep challenging follow-up questions that might arise from controversial topics, thereby maintaining a favorable public image. This strategy, while potentially comforting in the short term, carries the risk of alienating broader audiences that are crucial for electoral success. Unlike many successful politicians who actively engage with swing districts and undecided voters, Trump appears to be rallying his existing supporters, which could limit his appeal in a general election scenario.

There is also a historical precedent for concern regarding the reliability of information presented to Fox News viewers. During the 2012 election, the network's predictions of a Romney victory were ultimately proven wrong, raising questions about the accuracy of the narratives being pushed to its audience. This context underscores the potential pitfalls of Trump's current media strategy, as it may not only mislead his supporters but also fail to resonate with the wider electorate.

As Trump continues to navigate the political landscape, his reliance on Fox News may serve to solidify his base but could also hinder his ability to attract new supporters. The long-term implications of this strategy remain to be seen, particularly as the electoral landscape evolves and the need for broader appeal becomes increasingly critical. The question remains: will this focused approach on a single network ultimately bolster Trump's candidacy, or will it create barriers that could impede his path to electoral success?",-1.0,19.0,421.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.0023752969121140144,445.0,1.1875,0.04269662921348315
Real_61-Webpage,“Why Aren’t I 50 Points Ahead?” – Eagle Rising,"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again.

Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.

But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.”

For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.

Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump?

At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question:

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

As the 2016 presidential election draws near, the landscape of the race has shifted dramatically, leaving many liberals grappling with uncertainty. Initially, there was a prevailing belief among supporters of Hillary Clinton that her victory was a foregone conclusion, with the campaign viewed more as a formality than a fierce contest. However, recent developments have revealed a more competitive environment than anticipated.

Clinton's campaign strategy has drawn scrutiny, particularly her decision to minimize media interactions. This approach allowed her opponent, Donald Trump, to dominate the conversation, gaining traction in the eyes of the electorate. The period following the Democratic National Convention (DNC) has been particularly telling, as Trump has steadily gained momentum, raising alarms among Clinton's supporters.

Compounding the campaign's challenges are concerns regarding Clinton's health, which have prompted discussions among some Democrats about a potential ""Plan B."" These discussions highlight the anxiety within the party as polls indicate Trump leading in several critical battleground states. The shifting dynamics have left many questioning the effectiveness of Clinton's campaign strategy and messaging.

During a recent campaign event in Las Vegas, Clinton expressed her bewilderment at not having a more significant lead in the polls. She emphasized the importance of her message focused on working families, urging her supporters to take an active role in disseminating information about Trump and his policies. ""We need to ensure that voters understand what is at stake,"" Clinton stated, underscoring the urgency of the campaign's mission.

In a bid to rally her base, Clinton encouraged supporters to ""stage an intervention"" for anyone contemplating a vote for Trump. She advocated for fact-based discussions, urging her followers to engage in meaningful conversations with those who may be swayed by Trump's rhetoric. This call to action reflects the campaign's recognition of the need to counteract Trump's growing appeal and to reinforce the significance of Clinton's platform.

As the election approaches, the challenges facing Clinton's campaign are becoming increasingly evident. With a competitive race on the horizon and concerns about Trump's momentum, her team must navigate these obstacles carefully to secure a victory in November. The stakes are high, and the coming weeks will be crucial in determining the outcome of this contentious election.",11.0,37.0,413.0,0.6875,0.026634382566585957,437.0,2.0555555555555554,0.08466819221967964

Over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, Bobby Knight said Wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like Donald Trump.

""There’s nobody that I’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right,"" Knight told an audience in Toledo, Ohio, his home state. ""And I think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United States. And there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been Donald Trump.""

Story Continued Below

Back on the campaign trail with Trump after several months, Knight extolled the Republican nominee as ""not just an American; he’s a world figure.""

""He’s known all over the world. Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together,"" the coach continued. ""United States around the world. A lot of businesses. Created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world.""

And Trump, Knight later indicated, is the person for the White House.

""Believe me when I tell you, I think you’re all gonna agree on this: Our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the United States of America,"" Knight said. He noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, ""immigration problems and on and on.""

Remarking on his study of history, Knight said that he had come to the conclusion that ""when I need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man I want to choose and the first man I want to see.""

Knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't ""dress as well as politicians dress, but I want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, I wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""

""And I think that when you leave, I hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the United States,"" Knight said.

Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it. Although Islamic terrorism would seem to be the most likely explanation, there have been “mad bombers” who’ve done this sort of thing before (See Ted Kaczynski & George Metesky).

Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation.

That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.

ELIZABETH, NJ – Authorities are investigating the discovery of three pipe bombs and two smaller explosive devices at the NJ Transit Station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The alarming find has raised concerns following a series of recent bomb explosions on the Jersey Shore and in New York City.

The incident unfolded when a bag containing wires and pipes was found in a trash can near the train station. Elizabeth's Mayor confirmed the discovery, prompting immediate action from local law enforcement and federal agencies. The FBI has arrived on the scene and is actively conducting an investigation to determine the origins and intended targets of the devices.

Officials suspect that the bomb discoveries may be linked to a small team or an individual, given the close proximity of the incidents. While Islamic terrorism is considered a likely motive, authorities are also taking into account historical cases involving ""mad bombers"" who have acted independently. 

In a related development, the FBI has arrested five individuals believed to be connected to a separate bombing investigation in Chelsea, New York. However, as of now, none of those arrested have been formally charged. This connection has added an additional layer of complexity to the ongoing investigations into the recent bombings.

The motive behind the bombings in Elizabeth and surrounding areas remains unclear. Authorities are grappling with questions regarding whether the intent was to instill fear among the public or to cause mass casualties. The situation continues to evolve, and law enforcement is urging the public to remain vigilant.

Real_64-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on Between Two Ferns: 'I really regret doing this',"Story highlights The interview is part of the Clinton campaign's attempt to show a funnier, softer side

President Barack Obama also sat down with Zach Galifianakis to tout the Affordable Care Act

(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it.

Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video , plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself.

""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs.

Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump.

""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention.

Magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect

A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said.

""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening.

Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami.

""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer.""

The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.

Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

The defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, James Patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.

A federal magistrate has denied a request for the immediate arraignment of Ahmad Rahami, the suspect in a recent bombing incident, on federal charges. U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein, presiding over the case, stated that Rahami does not need to appear in federal court until he is taken into federal custody.

Currently, Rahami is in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, according to Gorenstein. The magistrate emphasized that the federal government has not yet arrested Rahami, and he noted that there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. This clarification comes amidst claims from Rahami's defense lawyers, who asserted that federal law enforcement is involved in his detention and questioning. Gorenstein disputed this assertion, reinforcing the notion that Rahami remains under local jurisdiction.

In his ruling, Gorenstein rejected the defense's claims that a federal court rule mandates a prompt arraignment irrespective of state custody. He declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who is currently hospitalized in Newark, and stated that he cannot appoint defense counsel for the suspect at this time.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch has announced plans for Rahami to be transported to New York City shortly, where he will face federal charges. The federal complaint expected to be filed in New York is anticipated to take precedence over any state charges that may be pending in New Jersey.

The decision made by U.S. Magistrate Judge Gorenstein has drawn attention, but U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office has declined to comment on the magistrate's ruling. Additionally, defense attorney James Patton did not respond to requests for comment regarding the outcome of the arraignment request.

As the situation develops, the legal proceedings surrounding Rahami are expected to unfold in New York, where the federal charges will be processed. The case has attracted significant media coverage due to the serious nature of the accusations against Rahami and the implications of federal versus state jurisdiction in his case.

The denial of immediate arraignment underscores the complexities involved in transitioning a suspect from local to federal custody, particularly in cases involving serious criminal charges. As authorities prepare for Rahami's eventual transport to New York City, the legal community watches closely to see how the federal court will navigate the intricacies of this high-profile case.",-25.0,-35.0,471.0,-1.5625,-0.05307855626326964,428.0,-2.1875,-0.08177570093457943
Real_66-Webpage,US: ISIS did not use mustard agent in base attack,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL — OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

A final laboratory test has confirmed that a weapon fired by ISIS at US troops did not contain a mustard agent, putting to rest concerns about the use of chemical weapons in the incident. The event occurred at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq on September 20, where initial tests indicated the possible deployment of a chemical weapon, leading to immediate decontamination procedures for US personnel.

Col. John Dorrian, spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, took to Twitter to announce that definitive results from the latest test showed no chemical weapon was involved in the attack. This conclusion follows a series of tests conducted to assess the nature of the weapon used by ISIS.

Earlier, Gen. Joseph Dunford had assessed the weapon as a sulfur mustard blister agent during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, raising alarms about the potential implications for US forces. However, a subsequent test produced negative results, while a third test yielded inconclusive findings. The latest laboratory confirmation serves as the final verification, alleviating fears regarding the safety of US personnel in the region.

Real_67-Webpage,"Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say","The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.

""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.

Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.

A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.

The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.

""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.

He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""

James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.

""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.

""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg,"More Meghan,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997,"{""fb_title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@mkeneally"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-19"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-19 18:04:32"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race""}","- Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have heightened focus on presidential candidates' national security policies.

Recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, coupled with a stabbing attack in Minnesota, have ignited a renewed focus on national security policies among presidential candidates. The violent incidents, which resulted in numerous injuries, have prompted responses from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, each seeking to address the growing concerns of the American public.

The attacks have not only caused immediate fear but have also shifted the political landscape as voters reassess their preferences for candidates who promise to enhance national security. John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, emphasized the significant impact that such terrorist incidents have on voter sentiment. He noted that fear often drives voters to favor candidates perceived as stronger on security issues, a trend that could influence the upcoming election.

Prior to the attacks, national polls indicated that Clinton held a lead over Trump in terms of public trust regarding handling terrorism. According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on September 11, Clinton was favored by 50% of all adults, compared to Trump's 41%. Among likely voters, the gap narrowed slightly, with Clinton at 48% and Trump at 45%. A CBS/New York Times poll from September 14 revealed that 49% of respondents preferred Clinton for managing terrorism, while 45% favored Trump. Furthermore, a Quinnipiac poll on September 15 showed Clinton leading Trump 49% to 47% when it came to perceived ability to keep the country safe from terrorism.

However, Cohen pointed out a notable shift in the perception of national security, as the Republican Party has historically been viewed as the stronger option in this area. Concerns surrounding Trump’s understanding of terrorism have emerged, leading to questions about his ability to effectively address such threats. In light of the recent attacks, both candidates are adjusting their campaign strategies, with an increased emphasis on national security in their speeches and public appearances.

Cohen also raised alarms about Trump’s rhetoric, particularly his proposals to bar foreign Muslims from entering the U.S. He expressed concern that such statements could inadvertently inspire further acts of violence. This perspective highlights the delicate balance candidates must maintain as they navigate the complex landscape of national security while attempting to rally voter support.

James Campbell, a political science professor, offered additional insights, suggesting that terrorist events could potentially benefit Trump while posing challenges for Clinton. He argued that these incidents might be perceived as failures of the current administration's foreign policy, which could sway public opinion in favor of Trump’s more aggressive stance on immigration and security.

Campbell further indicated that the heightened scrutiny on individuals with Muslim-sounding names could bolster support for the tougher immigration policies associated with Trump’s campaign. As voters react to the recent violence and reassess their views on national security, the implications for both candidates could be profound.

As the presidential race intensifies, the focus on national security is likely to remain at the forefront of political discourse. With the potential for shifting voter sentiments in the wake of recent attacks, both Clinton and Trump are poised to adapt their strategies to address the pressing concerns of an anxious electorate. The coming weeks will be critical as candidates seek to reassure voters of their capabilities to ensure safety and security in an increasingly uncertain world.",6.0,5.0,604.0,0.3333333333333333,0.009933774834437087,630.0,0.21739130434782608,0.007936507936507936

When is the first general election presidential debate?

The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.

Story Continued Below

What time is the debate and how long is it?

The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.

How can I watch the debate?

It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.

Who will participate in the debate?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.

Who will moderate the debate?

Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.

What is the format of the debate?

The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.

Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?

Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.

What's at stake for Hillary Clinton?

The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.

What's at stake for Donald Trump?

Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again.

What is the most watched debate in presidential history?

In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.

What's the most-watched television moment of all time?

Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.

Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.

The political landscape is poised for a significant moment as the first general election presidential debate of 2016 is scheduled to take place on September 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. This highly anticipated event will begin at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and is set to last for a full 90 minutes, providing a platform for the candidates to engage with one another and the American public without commercial interruptions.

The debate will be accessible to a wide audience, as it will be broadcast on major television networks, as well as the websites of leading cable news channels and C-SPAN. This extensive coverage ensures that millions of viewers will have the opportunity to witness the unfolding political discourse.

Participants in this inaugural debate will include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. Notably, no other candidates qualified for this debate, as only Clinton and Trump have met the necessary criteria set by the debate commission. The absence of third-party candidates, such as Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, is due to their failure to achieve the 15 percent polling threshold required for participation.

The debate will be moderated by Lester Holt, the anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."" This marks Holt's second time moderating a debate during the 2016 presidential cycle, bringing his experience to the forefront as he guides the discussion. The format of the debate consists of six segments, each lasting 15 minutes. The structure begins with a question posed by Holt, followed by two minutes for each candidate to provide their initial response. Following these responses, candidates will have the opportunity for rebuttal, allowing for a dynamic exchange of ideas.

Tentative topics for the debate have been outlined, including “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” However, these subjects are subject to change based on the prevailing current events, ensuring that the debate remains relevant to the issues facing the nation.

For Hillary Clinton, this debate represents a critical opportunity to regain momentum following recent polling challenges. With her extensive experience in policy and debates, Clinton aims to showcase her knowledge and assert her position as a viable candidate for the presidency. Her strategy will likely focus on addressing voter concerns and reinforcing her qualifications for the role.

Conversely, Donald Trump approaches the debate with the aim of countering perceptions that he lacks policy depth and self-restraint. With expectations set lower for him compared to Clinton, Trump has a unique opportunity to surprise viewers and solidify his standing among undecided voters. His performance could play a pivotal role in shifting public perception and garnering support as the election approaches.

The significance of presidential debates in American history cannot be overstated. The most-watched debate to date was the 1980 face-off between President Jimmy Carter and challenger Ronald Reagan, which captivated an audience of 80.6 million viewers. Such historical moments highlight the power of debates in shaping public opinion and influencing electoral outcomes. 

While the 1980 debate holds the record for viewership, it is essential to note that Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 remains the most-watched television program in U.S. history, drawing an audience of 114 million. However, global events, such as the moon landing and the wedding of Prince Charles, have captured even larger audiences, illustrating the diverse factors that draw viewers to significant broadcasts.

As the countdown to the debate continues, anticipation builds among voters, political analysts, and the media. The event promises to be a crucial moment in the 2016 presidential election cycle, setting the stage for the candidates to articulate their visions for the future of America. With the stakes higher than ever, both Clinton and Trump will strive to make a lasting impression on the electorate, shaping the narrative leading into the upcoming election. 

As the nation prepares for this pivotal moment in political discourse, all eyes will be on Hofstra University, where the first debate of the 2016 presidential race will unfold, potentially influencing the direction of the election and the future of the country.",14.0,31.0,780.0,0.3684210526315789,0.017948717948717947,760.0,1.1071428571428572,0.04078947368421053

Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday in Linden, N.J. | Nicolaus Czarnecki/Boston Herald via AP U.S. attorney sees no rush to arraign Rahami in federal court

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing.

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.

However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved.

""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""

The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.

Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.

While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.

The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.

Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect involved in a recent shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey, is currently in custody as legal proceedings begin to unfold. Following the shootout, which resulted in his arrest, Rahami is facing serious charges, including five counts of attempted murder.

Federal prosecutors have indicated their opposition to an immediate arraignment for Rahami on federal charges, emphasizing that he is not currently in federal custody. Instead, Rahami is facing state charges in New Jersey, where he remains hospitalized in Newark. His defense attorneys have requested a prompt court proceeding to formally inform him of the charges against him and to clarify his rights. However, the status of his Miranda rights remains unclear, as defense lawyers assert that Rahami has been without legal counsel since his arrest.

A judge has set Rahami's bail at an astonishing $5.2 million, reflecting the severity of the charges he faces. An initial court appearance has been scheduled for September 28, where further legal proceedings are expected to take place. Despite the defense's requests for immediate action, no decisions have yet been made by the magistrate regarding these matters.

Lawmakers involved in the case have noted that Rahami has not been cooperating with the ongoing investigation, which has raised concerns among prosecutors. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has mentioned that there are plans to move Rahami to Manhattan soon, although prosecutors have shown little urgency regarding this transfer. 

In the backdrop of these developments, the Federal Defenders office has sought to be appointed as Rahami's counsel. However, prosecutors have deemed this request premature, indicating that they do not see the need for such an appointment at this stage of the proceedings.

As the legal situation continues to evolve, the implications of Rahami's actions and the subsequent investigation remain a focal point for law enforcement and the public alike. The upcoming court appearance is expected to shed more light on the charges against him and the legal strategies that will be employed by both the defense and prosecution.

The case serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding criminal proceedings, particularly when federal and state jurisdictions intersect. With significant charges pending and a high-profile nature surrounding the case, all eyes will be on the courtroom as the legal process unfolds.

As Rahami's situation develops, the community remains vigilant, awaiting further updates on the case and the implications it may hold for public safety and legal accountability. The coming weeks are likely to reveal more about the nature of the charges and the defense's approach to addressing them.",-21.0,-15.0,597.0,-1.05,-0.035175879396984924,491.0,-0.7894736842105263,-0.03054989816700611
Real_7-Webpage,Donald Trump's rise puts Ted Cruz in a bind,"Story highlights Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump earlier this year, but is under pressure to change his mind now

Cruz could face a primary challenge in 2018 from a fellow Republican

Washington (CNN) Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said.

JUST WATCHED Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife 01:51

On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them.""

Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

This situation has intensified as key figures within the party, including Rep. Trent Franks, urge Cruz to back Trump in a bid to thwart a potential Hillary Clinton presidency. Franks, a former Cruz supporter, has articulated concerns that failing to support Trump could jeopardize the election outcome and undermine constitutional integrity.

Cruz's supporters, however, are advocating for him to maintain his stance against endorsing Trump, citing the risk of alienating his own voter base. Prominent Cruz backer Steve Deace has expressed that endorsing Trump would contradict the principles that Cruz has long upheld regarding political endorsements.

As the election date draws closer, with less than two months remaining, the urgency for Cruz to demonstrate support for Trump is palpable. Trump's rising poll numbers further complicate Cruz's decision, as the stakes escalate for the Republican Party. The potential ramifications of Cruz’s choice are significant; should the election be closely contested and Trump fail to secure a victory, there is a prevailing sentiment among Trump’s supporters that Cruz could be held accountable for not backing the nominee.

The dynamics within the party highlight the tensions between loyalty to party leadership and the need to preserve individual political principles. As the election approaches, all eyes are on Cruz to see if he will ultimately align with Trump or remain steadfast in his position.",10.0,20.0,294.0,1.1111111111111112,0.034013605442176874,278.0,2.0,0.07194244604316546

Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks.

The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe.

“Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.”

Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.”

“They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”

His remarks come in the wake of recent violent incidents, including bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing in Minnesota, which have heightened concerns regarding domestic terrorism.

Taking to Twitter, Trump criticized Clinton, declaring, “Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS... for years,” and underscored the urgent need for innovative strategies to combat the ongoing threat. He accused both Clinton and Obama of shying away from the term “radical Islamic terrorism,” suggesting that their reluctance has emboldened terrorist groups on a global scale.

Trump further asserted that Clinton is attempting to divert attention from her shortcomings during her tenure as Secretary of State. He expressed concern that terrorists are anticipating a Clinton presidency, which he claims would enable them to perpetuate their violent agendas. 

In his call for change, Trump condemned the current administration's portrayal of the fight against the Islamic State as merely a “narrative fight,” insisting that such an approach is insufficient. He pledged to put an end to what he described as senseless acts of violence, framing the threat posed by terrorists as an existential danger to the United States and its core values.

As the discourse around national security intensifies, Trump's comments reflect a growing urgency among some political leaders to reassess strategies in the face of rising threats.

Real_71-Webpage,Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible',"Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.

Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.

Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""

On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""

""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.

A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.

""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.

Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.

Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.

This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.

Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.

Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.

Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.

On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.

Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""

Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.

""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.

Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.

Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.

All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.

On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.

""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.

A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.

Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""

Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.

Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.

Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.

In a federal courtroom, gripping testimony has emerged regarding the controversial lane closures at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013, a scandal that has haunted former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his administration. The testimony revealed that former Port Authority executives and staff members from Christie's office deliberately aimed to exacerbate traffic conditions in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as a form of political retribution against the town's Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich.

David Wildstein, a former director at the Port Authority, took the stand and provided crucial insights into the motivations behind the lane closures. Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and civil rights violations, is cooperating with the prosecution as part of a plea deal. His testimony painted a picture of a politically charged environment where frustration over Sokolich's refusal to endorse Christie led to drastic and unethical decisions.

Wildstein recounted that Bridget Kelly, Christie's ex-deputy chief of staff, expressed her dissatisfaction with Sokolich's decision to withhold an endorsement. Sokolich's reluctance stemmed from a desire to maintain good relations with his constituents in the predominantly Democratic town. This political friction, according to Wildstein, set the stage for the lane closures, which he suggested as a means to exert pressure on Sokolich.

On August 13, 2013, Kelly sent an email indicating it was time to address traffic issues in Fort Lee. Wildstein acknowledged that this message foreshadowed the impending lane closures. A subsequent phone call between Wildstein, Kelly, and former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni confirmed that the closures would proceed without any advance notice to Fort Lee officials or the public, a decision that Wildstein did not question. He stated that he followed directives from senior officials, highlighting a chain of command that prioritized political objectives over public safety.

Wildstein took on the responsibility of coordinating the lane closures, maintaining communication with Kelly and Baroni throughout the planning and execution phases. The trio agreed on a ""radio silence"" policy, effectively silencing any inquiries from Fort Lee officials by directing all calls to Baroni's office, which would remain unresponsive. This strategy was designed to maximize the impact of the closures on Fort Lee, as the lack of advance notice would exacerbate traffic congestion.

The timing of the lane closures was also a calculated move. Wildstein discussed the planned closures with Baroni and Kelly, strategically targeting the start of the school year on September 9, when traffic would be expected to surge. Initially, Wildstein proposed closing all three access lanes to the bridge but later opted to close two lanes after consulting with engineers, demonstrating a degree of caution amid the politically motivated chaos.

On September 6, just days before the closures were set to begin, Wildstein informed Port Authority staff about the planned lane restrictions starting September 9. Despite concerns raised regarding potential traffic issues, Wildstein remained resolute that the closures would proceed as planned. He misled staff into believing the lane closures were part of a legitimate traffic study, further illustrating the deception at play.

As the day of the closures arrived, Wildstein actively monitored the traffic buildup and communicated the results to Kelly, who expressed satisfaction with the ensuing chaos. Meanwhile, Fort Lee officials, including Mayor Sokolich, frantically attempted to reach both Baroni and Wildstein for clarification, only to be met with silence due to the established ""radio silence"" policy. This lack of communication left the town's leaders in the dark as their constituents faced significant traffic disruptions.

Wildstein's testimony also revealed the underlying political motivations driving the actions of Baroni and Kelly. He indicated that Baroni's role was primarily to represent Christie's interests, adhering to what was termed the ""one constituent rule,"" which prioritized Christie's favor in Port Authority decisions over the needs of the citizens of Fort Lee. This revelation underscores the extent to which political considerations influenced the decision-making processes within the Port Authority.

As the legal proceedings continue, both Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni are facing serious conspiracy and fraud charges related to the lane closures. They are expected to testify in their defense, but the damaging testimony from Wildstein has already cast a long shadow over their case. The scandal has raised significant questions about the ethical conduct of public officials and the lengths to which they may go to achieve political objectives.

The ramifications of the lane closures have been far-reaching, impacting not only the individuals involved but also the public's trust in government institutions. As the trial unfolds, it remains to be seen how the jury will interpret the actions of those in power and whether justice will be served for the residents of Fort Lee who were caught in the crossfire of political maneuvering.

In conclusion, the testimony presented in federal court has shed light on the troubling motivations behind the George Washington Bridge lane closures. The actions of former Port Authority executives and Christie staffers reveal a disturbing intersection of politics and public service, raising serious ethical concerns that will likely resonate long after the trial concludes. As the legal battle continues, the public remains watchful, eager for accountability in a scandal that has left an indelible mark on New Jersey's political landscape.",9.0,-21.0,1009.0,0.225,0.008919722497522299,975.0,-0.6,-0.021538461538461538

It's living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state

(CNN) Florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the November election.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched.

The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.

""So if I had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin,"" says USF Tampa political scientist Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor at the University of South Florida. ""We're to the point where anything is possible. This is just one of those kind of elections.""

All eyes are on central Florida's I-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. The area stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics.

Real_74-Webpage,HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night’s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Here’s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday’s debate? — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet’s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

There’s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night’s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins aren’t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

@HuffingtonPost someone’s upset that #Trumpwins — Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? — Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ? pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y — Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn’t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate – except for the little watched @CNN poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, “Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN’s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.” They actually looks like they’re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

In the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, the discourse surrounding its outcome has intensified, fueled by contrasting polling results. A CNN/ORC poll indicated that a significant 62% of respondents believed Hillary Clinton emerged victorious in the debate. This finding aligns with traditional polling methods that have been widely regarded as credible in gauging public opinion.

Conversely, numerous online polls painted a different picture, with many indicating that Donald Trump won by a substantial margin. This discrepancy has led to questions regarding the reliability of online polling compared to established methods like CNN's. The Huffington Post, in particular, raised concerns about the validity of these online polls, suggesting that their accessibility may lead to skewed results. Unlike traditional polls, which are often more controlled and representative, online polls can be easily manipulated, allowing anyone with internet access to participate.

Reports have surfaced suggesting that Trump supporters actively engaged in manipulating online polls through platforms like 4chan and Reddit. This tactic has raised eyebrows and further fueled the debate over the authenticity of the results. Many Trump supporters expressed their dissatisfaction with the coverage provided by the Huffington Post, feeling that the outlet did not adequately reflect their views or the outcomes of the online polling.

In the wake of the debate, Trump took to social media to assert his stance, claiming that he had won all polls except for the CNN poll. He highlighted the trending hashtag #TrumpWon on Twitter, which his supporters used to express their belief in his victory. Additionally, Trump shared an article from the Daily Mail, which suggested that most snap polls favored him, despite CNN's findings indicating that Clinton was the clear winner.

The contrasting narratives surrounding the debate outcome have left many observers puzzled. While traditional polling methods, such as the CNN/ORC poll, indicated a strong preference for Clinton, the online polls suggested a different story, one that Trump and his supporters were eager to champion. This divergence raises important questions about the methodologies behind polling and the impact of social media on public perception.

As the debate over the debate continues, it is essential to consider the broader implications of these findings. The evidence, particularly from traditional polling sources, suggests that Hillary Clinton won the debate. However, the fervor of online support for Trump and the manipulation of polling data highlight a growing divide in how voters engage with and interpret political discourse.

The ongoing conversation surrounding the debate underscores the complexities of modern political communication, where traditional media and online platforms often present conflicting narratives. As both candidates prepare for the next stages of their campaigns, the implications of these polling results will likely continue to influence their strategies and the perceptions of their respective supporters.

In conclusion, while the CNN/ORC poll indicates a clear victory for Clinton, the fervent responses from Trump supporters and the results of various online polls illustrate a contentious landscape in American politics. The debate may have ended, but the conversation surrounding its outcome is far from over.",35.0,47.0,556.0,1.75,0.06294964028776978,576.0,2.0434782608695654,0.08159722222222222
Real_75-Webpage,Tim Kaine on Libertarian ticket: 'Everybody knows they're not going to win',"Story highlights Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine says third-party Libertarian candidates will lose

He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson

(CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose.

""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week.

Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history.

""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. It may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. That's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history.""

In his argument, Kaine draws on historical precedent, citing the 2000 presidential election as a critical example. He points to the impact of Ralph Nader's candidacy, which many believe swayed the election results by drawing votes away from Democratic candidate Al Gore. Kaine highlights that Nader's influence was particularly felt in key states like New Hampshire and Florida, where every vote proved pivotal.

Kaine's message is clear: a protest vote for a third-party candidate who is unlikely to win could inadvertently jeopardize the chances of more viable candidates. He emphasizes the importance of considering the broader implications of such voting choices, urging voters to think critically about the potential outcomes.

Real_76-Webpage,Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s Vice President Joe Biden.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday’s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

“This is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?”

Adding:

“Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

“He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘You’re fired.’ They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

“He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

“If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord… What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.”

And it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Watch Biden lay into Trump here:

PHILADELPHIA — Vice President Joe Biden took to the stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday to rally support for Hillary Clinton, delivering a pointed critique of Donald Trump's recent debate remarks. The event, part of Clinton's campaign efforts, saw Biden express disbelief and anger over Trump's comments regarding the housing market.

During his speech, Biden focused on Trump's assertion that the failure of the housing market could be seen as a good business opportunity. ""How can anyone think it’s good business to see the housing market fail?"" Biden questioned, underscoring the devastating impact such a failure has on American families and communities. He emphasized that this perspective starkly contrasts with the values held by past presidents, including those from the Republican Party, who have traditionally maintained a moral center regarding American rights and values.

Biden further argued that Trump's approach reveals a lack of fundamental sensibilities that are typically shared among most American politicians. He expressed concern that Trump's views represent a significant departure from the ethical standards expected of leaders in the nation. ""We have always had a moral obligation to our citizens, and it's disheartening to see someone who doesn’t share that commitment,"" Biden stated.

One of the most striking points of Biden's address was his condemnation of Trump's pride in not paying taxes. He highlighted the inherent unfairness of such a stance, particularly in light of the sacrifices made by ordinary citizens who diligently fulfill their tax obligations. ""It’s an insult to the hardworking Americans who contribute to our society,"" Biden asserted, reflecting a sentiment of frustration that resonated with many in the audience.

Biden's speech was marked by an emotional intensity as he conveyed his anger over Trump's comments and what he perceives as a pervasive cynicism in Trump's attitude toward the American people. He articulated a clear distinction between the two candidates, asserting that the upcoming election presents a pivotal choice for voters.

In closing, Biden endorsed Hillary Clinton, framing her as the candidate who embodies the values and principles that Americans hold dear. ""The choice in this election is clear,"" he declared, urging attendees to consider the implications of their vote. ""We need a leader who will fight for all of us, not just for the privileged few.""

At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday.

The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.

Story Continued Below

The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.

The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.

""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""

In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.

“This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

A recent report from the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) inspector general has unveiled a significant oversight in the naturalization process, revealing that 858 individuals who were ordered for deportation were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship. This alarming finding has raised concerns about the integrity of the citizenship vetting process and the potential for individuals with questionable backgrounds to gain legal status.

The report highlights that these mistakes stemmed from incomplete records in the digital fingerprint repositories maintained by both the DHS and the FBI. Specifically, the issue arose from the inconsistent digitization of paper fingerprint cards that predate 2008, which has resulted in critical gaps in the records used for verifying applicants' backgrounds. Furthermore, the report noted that fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement actions were not always shared with the FBI, compounding the problem.

While the inspector general's report indicated that those granted citizenship were categorized as ""potentially"" ineligible, it is crucial to note that this does not necessarily mean that citizenship was granted incorrectly. The report also clarified that not all applicants with incomplete records were automatically granted citizenship; some faced denials in their applications.

In light of these findings, the Department of Homeland Security is taking steps to address the issues surrounding incomplete fingerprint records. Preliminary reviews conducted by the inspector general's office revealed that a significant number of naturalization applications were denied, with some cases currently under criminal investigation or in denaturalization proceedings. This suggests that the oversight may not be as widespread as initially feared, but it does underscore the need for a thorough examination of the naturalization process.

Among the most concerning aspects of the report is the revelation that three individuals who had previously been deported and were later granted citizenship obtained security clearance for sensitive positions. However, their credentials have since been revoked, raising serious questions about the vetting process and the potential risks posed by such oversights.

Inspector General John Roth emphasized the importance of having access to complete fingerprint records, stating that it is essential to prevent fraud in naturalization applications. The lack of comprehensive records not only undermines the integrity of the citizenship process but also poses a risk to national security.

The findings of this report come at a time when immigration remains a contentious issue in American politics. Former President Donald Trump has long advocated for stricter immigration vetting processes, previously proposing a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and more recently focusing on banning immigration from countries deemed compromised by terrorism. Trump's stance reflects broader concerns among many Americans regarding the effectiveness of the current immigration system and the potential vulnerabilities that exist.

As the Department of Homeland Security works to rectify the issues highlighted in the inspector general's report, the findings serve as a reminder of the complexities involved in the immigration process and the critical need for accurate and complete records. The implications of these mistakes extend beyond individual cases, impacting the overall trust in the naturalization system and the nation's ability to ensure that those granted citizenship meet the necessary criteria for legal residency. 

Moving forward, it is imperative for the DHS to enhance its record-keeping practices and ensure that all relevant information is shared among agencies to prevent similar oversights in the future. The integrity of the naturalization process is essential not only for the individuals applying for citizenship but also for the safety and security of the nation as a whole.",-16.0,-10.0,559.0,-1.0,-0.028622540250447227,633.0,-0.47619047619047616,-0.01579778830963665
Real_78-Webpage,Insiders: The heat is on Hillary,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.

Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.

Story Continued Below

That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.

“She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,” said a Nevada Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.”

“The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,” a New Hampshire Democrat added. “Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.”

One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.

“Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the Ohio Democrat. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.”

Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.

“Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an Ohio Republican. “Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.”

“She has to stop [Trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a Virginia Republican. “All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.”

Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans — most pointed to the GOP nominee’s volatile personality.

“Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,” said a Michigan Republican. “The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.”

“The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?” added a Michigan Democrat. “Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?”

Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:

Most insiders expect Clinton to “win” the debate.

Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

“Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,” said an Iowa Republican.

“[Clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a New Hampshire Democrat.

But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.

“The press wants Trump to win,” said a Florida Democrat. “Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.”

Some Republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction.

“The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,” a Virginia Republican said. “But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.”

Insiders think the debate will matter.

Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.

Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle.

“Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a Michigan Democrat predicted. “The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.”

The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact.

“Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.”

But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump’s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.

“If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an Iowa Republican. “If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.”

Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.

“We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,” an Iowa Republican said. “Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.”

Added a Florida Democrat: “Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.”

As the first presidential debate looms, Hillary Clinton is under mounting pressure from both sides of the political aisle. Insiders from the Democratic and Republican parties are in agreement that expectations for Clinton's performance are significantly higher than for her opponent, Donald Trump. This consensus highlights the unique challenges Clinton faces as the first female major-party nominee, a position that comes with its own set of expectations and scrutiny.

A recent survey conducted by The POLITICO Caucus reveals that 69% of Democrats and 74% of Republicans believe that Clinton is experiencing more pressure than Trump as they prepare for the high-stakes debate. The results point to a growing concern among Democrats regarding the low expectations set for Trump, who has been criticized for his lack of experience and command over key issues. This discrepancy in expectations has raised eyebrows, particularly among Clinton's supporters, who feel that she is held to a different standard.

Some insiders have pointed out what they perceive to be a double standard in the scrutiny faced by Clinton. As the first woman to secure a major-party nomination, she is expected to perform at a level that surpasses that of her male counterparts. This expectation is compounded by the tightening polls, which indicate that Trump is gaining ground in crucial battleground states. Republicans acknowledge that Clinton's increased scrutiny is a direct result of these shifting dynamics, suggesting that the stakes for her are particularly high.

While some insiders believe that Trump is also under pressure, their concerns are largely centered around his volatile personality and his ability to maintain composure without the aid of a TelePrompTer. The unpredictability of Trump's behavior adds a layer of complexity to the debate, as it remains to be seen how he will handle the live format and the potential for unscripted moments.

Despite the varying opinions on pressure, a significant number of insiders predict that Clinton will emerge as the ""winner"" of the debate. According to the survey, 76% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans expect Clinton to outperform Trump. This optimistic outlook from a majority of Democrats reflects a belief that her extensive experience and preparation will pay off in the debate setting.

However, the debate is not without its controversies. Some Democrats have voiced concerns about media bias favoring Trump, while a segment of Republicans argues that the media is, in fact, biased in favor of Clinton. This ongoing debate about media influence adds another layer of complexity to the political landscape as both candidates prepare to face off.

The anticipated impact of the debate on the election is a topic of considerable discussion among political insiders. A majority believe that the debate will significantly affect the race, with 66% of Democrats expecting a boost for Clinton and 52% of Republicans believing it will help Trump. These predictions underscore the importance of the debate in shaping public perception and voter sentiment in the lead-up to the election.

Despite the prevailing belief that the debate will have an immediate impact, opinions diverge on whether these effects will be lasting. The current polarized environment, coupled with the unpopularity of both candidates, raises questions about the long-term significance of the debate. Some insiders suggest that the intense partisanship may dilute the potential for any lasting change in voter opinions.

As the debate approaches, all eyes will be on Clinton and Trump, with the nation eager to see how they navigate the challenges ahead. The stakes are high for both candidates, and the outcome of this debate could very well influence the trajectory of the election in the coming weeks.",43.0,13.0,2576.0,0.8431372549019608,0.016692546583850932,675.0,0.5,0.01925925925925926
Real_79-Webpage,Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

In a recent commentary, Frank Wilkenmeyer has taken aim at Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, labeling them as ""dimwitted"" due to their social media antics. This criticism comes on the heels of Eric Trump's latest post, which many have deemed foolish. The post in question involved Eric boasting about being featured in a crossword puzzle, a move that Wilkenmeyer found particularly amusing yet emblematic of the Trumps' overall social media presence. 

Wilkenmeyer expressed a sense of nostalgia for the Trump brothers’ antics, suggesting that their unique brand of social media engagement will be missed after the upcoming election. His remarks highlight a broader fascination with the often controversial and provocative online behavior exhibited by the Trump family, which has become a staple of political discourse in recent years.

The article further delves into the ongoing controversy surrounding former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's protest during the National Anthem, an act that has sparked a national dialogue on patriotism and free speech. Many conservative figures, including Donald Trump Jr., have condemned Kaepernick's actions, labeling them as unpatriotic. This condemnation has drawn sharp lines in the political landscape, with conservatives rallying against Kaepernick's method of protest.

In contrast, the left has taken a firm stance in defense of Kaepernick, arguing that athletes, like all citizens, have the right to express themselves under the First Amendment. This divide underscores a significant cultural rift in America, where expressions of dissent are often met with accusations of disloyalty or unpatriotism.

Wilkenmeyer, in his critique, has pointed out what he perceives as hypocrisy among conservative commentators. He notes their selective support for constitutional rights, which often seems to prioritize the Second Amendment while disregarding the First Amendment when it comes to free speech. This inconsistency raises important questions about the nature of patriotism and the rights guaranteed to all citizens under the Constitution.

Moreover, Wilkenmeyer challenges the notion that singing the National Anthem should be viewed as a litmus test for patriotism. He argues that such expectations are not only misguided but also counterproductive to the core values of freedom and expression that America espouses. The idea that one must conform to specific displays of patriotism, such as singing the National Anthem, diminishes the diverse ways in which individuals can express their love for their country.

The Supreme Court has historically reinforced the importance of free speech rights in contexts similar to Kaepernick's protest. Landmark decisions have established that the First Amendment protects not only popular speech but also dissenting opinions and actions. This legal precedent serves as a reminder of the fundamental rights that underpin American democracy, reinforcing the idea that patriotism can take many forms.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the discussions surrounding figures like Colin Kaepernick and the Trump brothers serve as a microcosm of the larger debates on free speech, patriotism, and the role of social media in contemporary society. Wilkenmeyer's commentary encapsulates the tension between differing views on what it means to be patriotic in today’s America, illustrating the complexity of these issues as they unfold in real time.

In conclusion, the discourse surrounding Kaepernick's protest and the Trump brothers' social media presence reflects a broader national conversation about rights, responsibilities, and the true essence of patriotism. As the election approaches, these discussions will undoubtedly continue to shape the political narrative, leaving an indelible mark on the fabric of American society.",-17.0,7.0,592.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.028716216216216218,647.0,0.30434782608695654,0.010819165378670788
Real_8-Webpage,More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump! – Eagle Rising,"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.

The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category.

Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.

Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.

Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.

Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”. Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said.

Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”

In a political landscape that is ever-changing, former President Donald Trump continues to solidify his position as a formidable contender for the upcoming elections. Following a week of significant achievements, Trump's support appears to be on the rise, as evidenced by several recent polls that showcase his growing popularity among voters.

According to a Fox News poll, Trump is currently leading with 46% of the vote, just ahead of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who sits at 45%. This is a notable shift, as Trump is gaining traction in what has historically been a competitive race. The LA Times/USC poll presents an even more favorable picture for Trump, showing him at 47% compared to Clinton's 41%. Meanwhile, the Suffolk University poll indicates Trump at 42% with Clinton trailing at 39%. Additionally, a CNN/ORC poll reveals that Trump holds a four-point lead in Florida, a crucial battleground state that could play a pivotal role in the election outcome.

As these polls suggest, the gaps in key battleground states are narrowing, with some states transitioning to ""toss up"" status. This shift indicates that Trump's campaign is resonating with voters, particularly in regions that could determine the election's fate. The narrowing margins signal a competitive race ahead, one that could see Trump gaining ground as he continues to engage with the electorate.

A significant part of Trump's recent strategy includes the introduction of a childcare policy plan, spearheaded by his daughter, Ivanka Trump. This initiative aims to address the needs of families across the nation and includes several key components designed to provide support for parents. The plan proposes six weeks of paid maternity leave, which would be funded through adjustments to the unemployment insurance program. This policy is expected to resonate with working families who are seeking greater support during critical periods of child-rearing.

Additionally, the plan outlines childcare rebates for lower-income families through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which could alleviate some of the financial burdens associated with childcare. For middle-class families, the proposal includes full childcare expense deductions, allowing them to reclaim some of their expenses at tax time. Furthermore, the introduction of tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) is designed to help families save for both childcare and elder care expenses, providing them with a financial safety net. Finally, the plan also includes tax deductions for stay-at-home parents, acknowledging the vital role they play in child development and family dynamics.

Trump's recent public appearances have further bolstered his image. He spoke at the prestigious Economic Club of New York, where he discussed his policies and vision for the country. Additionally, he made a notable appearance on The Dr. Oz Show, where he disclosed details about his health status. This disclosure comes on the heels of concerns surrounding Hillary Clinton's health, particularly after her fainting incident during a public event. By addressing his health openly, Trump aims to reassure voters and contrast his vitality with the uncertainties surrounding his opponent.

In a lighter moment, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, where he allowed the host to style his hair. This playful interaction showcased Trump's ability to laugh at himself and connect with a broader audience, emphasizing his relatability and charisma. Such appearances are crucial in humanizing candidates and making them more approachable to voters.

The former president's recent activities also include the opening of a new hotel in Washington, D.C. This venture has garnered endorsements from military officials and Medal of Honor recipients, further solidifying his support among key demographics. These endorsements not only reflect Trump's commitment to the military but also serve to enhance his credibility as a leader capable of making significant contributions to the nation.

In addressing the birther controversy, Trump has taken the opportunity to clarify his position. He stated that the issue was initially raised by Clinton's 2008 campaign and claimed to have resolved it. By confronting this controversy head-on, Trump seeks to shift the narrative and focus on his policies and vision for the future.

Throughout these developments, one theme remains clear: Trump's continued success and his defiance of political correctness. His ability to connect with voters, unveil meaningful policies, and maintain a confident public presence has positioned him as a strong candidate in the eyes of many. As the election season heats up, Trump's momentum appears to be building, setting the stage for a potentially competitive race that could reshape the political landscape once again.

In conclusion, as Trump navigates the complexities of the political arena, his recent successes and strategies indicate a concerted effort to rally support and resonate with voters. From unveiling childcare policies to addressing health concerns and engaging with the public through various media appearances, Trump is actively working to solidify his position as a leading contender. With polls showing a favorable shift in his direction and key battleground states becoming increasingly competitive, the upcoming election promises to be one of the most closely watched contests in recent history. As the political climate continues to evolve, one thing remains certain: Trump is not backing down and is prepared to fight for his place in the political arena.",59.0,92.0,1240.0,1.2291666666666667,0.04758064516129032,981.0,2.358974358974359,0.09378185524974515
Real_80-Webpage,Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground,"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.

Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.

He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.

Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.

Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.

Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.

These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.

Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.

""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.

Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.

Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump.

""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.

Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.

Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""

The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.

Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.

TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.

This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.

""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""

Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""

Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""

""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""

This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.

Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.

In a marked shift in media strategy, former President Donald Trump is increasingly favoring Fox News over other major networks, a tactic that appears designed to energize his core supporters while minimizing exposure to challenging questions. This strategy has become particularly evident in recent weeks, as Trump has made frequent appearances on popular Fox shows such as ""Fox & Friends"" and ""The O'Reilly Factor."" 

By opting for these friendly platforms, Trump is steering clear of press conferences and hard-hitting interviews that might put him in a position to face critical inquiries. This approach seems to reflect a broader campaign strategy that prioritizes engagement with his base rather than attempting to sway undecided voters. Critics argue that this tactic not only limits the scope of his media interactions but also reinforces a narrative that Trump is avoiding difficult discussions.

Despite claims from his surrogates that Trump is more accessible than his political rival, Hillary Clinton, the reality paints a different picture. Clinton has recently held multiple press conferences, while Trump has not faced reporters in such a setting since July. This absence has led to frustration among journalists who are eager for opportunities to question him directly. The growing concern over Trump's reluctance to hold press conferences is particularly pronounced given his past criticisms of Clinton for a similar lack of engagement with the media.

In addition to his avoidance of traditional news settings, Trump's recent media appearances have leaned heavily towards entertainment shows rather than serious news programs. This trend raises eyebrows among reporters who worry about the implications of a candidate who prefers to engage with platforms that may not challenge him as rigorously. Trump's last interviews with major networks have been notably limited, with a conspicuous absence from CNN since August, further indicating a deliberate strategy to sidestep potentially unfavorable press.

The focus on Fox News is not merely a matter of preference; it reflects a calculated decision to engage with an audience that is more sympathetic to his viewpoints. Critics have pointed out that Trump's exclusive appearances on Fox News underscore a systematic avoidance of less favorable press, which could ultimately hinder his ability to address a broader electorate. By limiting interactions to conservative outlets, Trump is reinforcing a controlled media narrative that aligns closely with his campaign messaging.

A key element of Trump's media strategy is his close relationship with Fox News host Sean Hannity. This partnership exemplifies the former president's approach to controlled messaging, as Hannity has been a consistent supporter of Trump throughout his political career. Upcoming town halls hosted by Hannity will address specific issues, further facilitating a platform that allows Trump to speak directly to his base without the risk of facing difficult questions from a more diverse media landscape.

As Trump continues to navigate the media landscape, the implications of his strategy are becoming increasingly clear. By prioritizing friendly interactions with conservative media, he is not only energizing his base but also avoiding the scrutiny that comes with traditional press engagements. This tactic may serve him well in the short term, but it raises questions about his long-term viability as a candidate who can appeal to a broader audience.

The ongoing debate about Trump's media strategy highlights the evolving nature of political communication in the digital age. As candidates increasingly rely on social media and targeted messaging, the traditional press may find itself at a disadvantage when it comes to holding politicians accountable. Trump's approach serves as a case study in how media strategies can be tailored to fit a specific political agenda, often at the cost of transparency and accountability.

In conclusion, Donald Trump's media strategy reflects a significant shift towards Fox News and away from traditional press interactions. By focusing on friendly media appearances and avoiding press conferences, Trump is prioritizing engagement with his base while limiting exposure to challenging questions. This approach, while effective in energizing supporters, raises concerns about the implications for democratic discourse and the role of the press in holding public figures accountable. As the political landscape continues to evolve, Trump's strategy may set a precedent for future candidates navigating the complex relationship between media and politics.",15.0,12.0,918.0,0.35714285714285715,0.016339869281045753,778.0,0.42857142857142855,0.015424164524421594

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.""

Pence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.

In a recent appearance on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour,"" former Vice President Mike Pence addressed the Trump campaign's allegations concerning a Washington Post article that reported Donald Trump used $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues. The Trump campaign has characterized the report as containing ""inaccuracies and omissions,"" prompting Pence to voice his concerns.

During the interview, Pence asserted that there are ""a number of factual errors"" in the Post's reporting. However, he refrained from providing specific examples to substantiate his claims. Instead, he expressed confidence that the Trump Foundation would take the necessary steps to address these inaccuracies, emphasizing that they would demonstrate legal compliance in the matter.

Pence's comments did not solely focus on the Trump campaign; he also redirected attention to the Clinton Foundation, suggesting it represents a ""larger issue"" in the context of charitable organizations. This shift in focus indicates Pence's intent to broaden the discussion beyond the immediate allegations against Trump.

When pressed by host Brian Williams for specific instances of errors in the Washington Post's reporting, Pence chose to defer to the Trump Foundation for further details. His decision to withhold specific examples highlights the ongoing complexities surrounding the allegations.

Despite the contentious nature of the discussion, Pence reiterated his support for a free and independent press, acknowledging the public's right to ask questions and seek clarity on such matters. The interview underscores the ongoing tensions between the Trump campaign and media outlets, as both sides navigate the intricate landscape of political reporting and public perception.",1.0,2.0,308.0,0.09090909090909091,0.003246753246753247,305.0,0.18181818181818182,0.006557377049180328
Real_82-Webpage,Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.

The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

New Jersey State Police

A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.

Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.

One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.

Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

New Jersey State Police

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.

""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""

Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.

Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

New Jersey State Police

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.

Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.

Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.

A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.

In a significant development in the investigation of explosive devices found in New York City and New Jersey, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, was captured in Linden, New Jersey. Rahami's arrest follows a series of events that have drawn attention to his background and history.

Born in Afghanistan in 1988, Rahami's journey to the United States has been a subject of some confusion. Initial reports suggested that he immigrated to the U.S. in 2000; however, his father claims that the family arrived in 1995. Court records reveal that Rahami is one of up to seven siblings and attended Edison High School in New Jersey, where he was described by former classmates as quiet, funny, and a ""pretty normal guy."" 

During his high school years, Rahami had a child with his girlfriend, indicating a personal life that was not entirely devoid of responsibility. After graduating, he enrolled at Middlesex County College, pursuing an associate's degree in criminal justice from 2010 to 2012. However, he did not complete his studies, leaving questions about his career path and aspirations.

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Ahmad worked. The family has faced legal challenges as well, having sued local police for alleged harassment in 2011, although the case was dismissed in 2012. This history of legal issues may provide context for Rahami's later actions, which have now escalated to serious criminal charges.

Investigators are currently examining Rahami's travel history, including a notable trip to Quetta, Pakistan, which lasted from April 2013 to March 2014. This trip has raised eyebrows among authorities as they seek to understand the extent of his connections abroad and any potential influences that may have contributed to his current situation.

Rahami's legal troubles began to mount in August 2014 when he was arrested for allegedly stabbing someone. However, he was not indicted on that charge, which raises further questions about his past behavior and interactions with law enforcement.

The circumstances surrounding his capture were dramatic. Rahami was apprehended after a shootout with police, during which he sustained at least one gunshot wound. Following his arrest, he has not been cooperative with investigators, refusing to provide his name, which complicates the ongoing investigation.

Currently, Rahami faces serious charges, including five counts of attempted murder and weapon-related offenses. His bail has been set at a staggering $5.2 million, reflecting the severity of the charges against him. The implications of these charges are profound, as they suggest a potential threat to public safety and have instigated widespread concern among local communities.

In a further development, the Afghan government has expressed its readiness to assist U.S. authorities regarding Rahami. This cooperation may provide additional insights into his background and any connections he may have maintained with individuals or groups in Afghanistan.

As the investigation unfolds, the focus will likely remain on understanding the motivations behind Rahami's alleged actions, his connections to the explosive devices found in New York City and New Jersey, and the broader implications for national security. The community is left grappling with the shock of the situation, as a former classmate remarked on how Rahami was perceived as an ordinary individual, contrasting sharply with the gravity of the charges he now faces.

As authorities continue to piece together the puzzle of Ahmad Khan Rahami's life and actions, the case serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding individuals with diverse backgrounds and the potential for unforeseen developments. The ongoing investigation will seek to uncover the truth behind the explosive devices and the motivations that led to Rahami's current predicament, as the nation watches closely for updates on this troubling case.",-17.0,-30.0,735.0,-0.53125,-0.02312925170068027,708.0,-1.1111111111111112,-0.0423728813559322
Real_83-Webpage,Trump’s puzzling pitch to black voters,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

“The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

“We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.

But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night.

“I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”

Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach.

“I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?”

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

“Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

“I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.”

Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.”

“The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.”

Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.

“They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”

In a bid to strengthen his appeal among African-American voters, former President Donald Trump held a campaign event at a historically significant African-American church in Cleveland. This stop was part of a broader strategy to address urban issues and counter accusations of racism from his political opponents, particularly Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.

During his address, Trump proposed a substantial expansion of ""stop-and-frisk"" policing policies, a move that has sparked significant debate and controversy within black communities across the nation. Critics argue that such policies promote racial profiling and disproportionately target African-Americans. Despite this backlash, Trump defended the initiative, asserting that it had been effective in New York City, where it was first implemented. His comments during a town hall meeting echoed this sentiment, as he reiterated his support for the controversial policing strategy.

The former president's outreach efforts come at a time when his support among African-American voters remains notably low. Some political analysts suggest that his attempts to engage with this demographic may be more about appealing to moderate white voters than genuinely addressing the concerns of black communities. This perception was further fueled by Trump's decision to surround himself with a diverse group of advisers during his Cleveland appearance, an effort that some viewed as a strategic move rather than a sincere commitment to inclusivity.

A prominent figure at the event was former boxing promoter Don King, who has faced his share of controversies but was given a significant platform to speak. King praised Trump as a ""gladiator"" battling against a political system that he claimed has historically harmed minorities. His remarks, while intended to bolster Trump's image among African-Americans, drew mixed reactions, reflecting the complexities of race relations in the current political climate.

Trump's comments regarding the state of African-American communities have also drawn criticism from notable figures, including civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis. Lewis, known for his longstanding commitment to civil rights and social justice, challenged Trump's narrative, emphasizing the ongoing struggles faced by black Americans and the need for genuine solutions rather than superficial outreach.

In a notable moment during the event, Trump criticized a police officer involved in the shooting of an unarmed black man, suggesting that the officer may have been ""choking."" This statement aimed to highlight his awareness of police-community relations, yet it also underscored the delicate balance Trump must strike between addressing issues of racial injustice and maintaining support from law enforcement.

In the backdrop of these discussions, Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, took to the media to defend the former president against accusations of racism. Cohen asserted that Trump believes in the ""unity of the human race,"" attempting to reposition him as a candidate who transcends racial divides. This defense comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Trump's past remarks and actions that many have interpreted as racially insensitive.

Trump's accusations against Democrats further emphasized his campaign strategy. He claimed that the Democratic Party has neglected black voters, only seeking their support during election cycles. This assertion is part of a larger narrative that Trump has employed to paint himself as a candidate willing to engage with African-American communities and address their needs.

As Trump continues his campaign, his efforts to connect with black voters remain complicated by the historical context of his policies and rhetoric. The expansion of ""stop-and-frisk,"" coupled with his controversial statements, presents a challenging landscape for the former president as he seeks to redefine his image and garner support from a demographic that has largely been critical of his administration.

In conclusion, Trump's Cleveland campaign stop reflects a multifaceted approach to engaging African-American voters, marked by both outreach and controversy. As he navigates the complexities of race relations in America, the effectiveness of his strategies and the reactions they elicit will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping the political landscape leading up to the next election.",-67.0,7.0,1178.0,-1.8108108108108107,-0.056876061120543296,733.0,0.2692307692307692,0.009549795361527967

Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged.

“If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.”

Story Continued Below

Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.”

Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.

But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.”

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.”

Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.

Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.

“I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.”

He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.

“I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.

Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, and a known supporter of Donald Trump, has weighed in on Trump’s recent comments regarding the birthplace of former President Barack Obama. In a statement that reflects his ongoing skepticism, Arpaio highlighted that Trump did not explicitly label Obama’s birth certificate as legitimate, suggesting that the former president’s document is still shrouded in doubt.

Arpaio, who gained national notoriety for his hard-line stance on immigration and law enforcement, previously spearheaded an investigation into the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate back in 2011. This investigation was part of a broader narrative that Trump leveraged to gain political traction, as he repeatedly insinuated that Obama was not born in the United States. Many critics have labeled these insinuations as racially charged and divisive.

In a recent shift, Trump appeared to back down from his long-standing birther claims. Under mounting pressure, he attempted to deflect responsibility by suggesting that the birther movement was actually initiated by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. This pivot has drawn mixed reactions from both supporters and detractors, with some questioning the sincerity of his previous assertions.

Despite Trump’s recent remarks, Arpaio remains steadfast in his belief that Obama’s birth certificate is forged. He continues to pursue his investigation, emphasizing that his focus is strictly on the legitimacy of the document itself, rather than on Obama’s birthplace. Arpaio has been clear in denying any racial motivations behind his actions, asserting that his inquiries are based solely on the evidence at hand.

However, during his commentary, Arpaio admitted to uncertainty regarding Obama’s actual birthplace, stating, “I have no idea now where he was born.” This admission adds a layer of complexity to his ongoing investigation and raises questions about the motivations behind his previous assertions.

Arpaio also clarified that he did not have any discussions with Trump regarding the birth certificate issue prior to Trump’s press conference. This lack of communication indicates that while both figures share a common interest in the topic, their approaches and conclusions may differ significantly.

The ongoing debate surrounding Obama’s birth certificate continues to be a contentious issue within American politics. Arpaio’s comments serve as a reminder of the lingering questions and controversies that have persisted since the early days of the Obama presidency. As the political landscape evolves, it remains to be seen how these discussions will impact the broader narrative surrounding race, identity, and legitimacy in American political discourse.

In summary, Joe Arpaio’s remarks on Trump’s acknowledgment of Obama’s birth certificate reveal a complex interplay of belief, skepticism, and political maneuvering. While Trump’s recent comments may suggest a shift away from birther claims, Arpaio’s unwavering stance underscores the persistent doubts that some continue to harbor about the authenticity of Obama’s documentation. As this story unfolds, the implications for both figures and their respective political legacies will be closely monitored by supporters and critics alike.",-9.0,-10.0,533.0,-0.5625,-0.016885553470919325,582.0,-0.5,-0.01718213058419244
Real_85-Webpage,Barack Obama at Benjamin Netanyahu meeting: 'He is always very candid with us',"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month

His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office.

Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency.

""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us.""

That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January.

Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

In a significant meeting, President Barack Obama sat down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the ongoing tensions in their foreign partnership. This encounter, likely to be their final face-to-face consultation before Obama leaves office, comes at a pivotal moment as the president seeks to assess the prospects for peace in the Middle East.

As Obama concludes his presidency, he expressed hope for productive discussions regarding Israel's future, focusing on the country's opportunities and challenges related to stability and security in the region. The meeting is particularly crucial given the backdrop of recent strains, notably Netanyahu's vocal opposition to U.S. policies, including the controversial nuclear agreement with Iran.

Throughout their relationship, Obama has acknowledged Netanyahu's candidness, which has often characterized their interactions. Despite personal tensions, the president is determined to strengthen ties with Israel for the benefit of his successor, highlighting the importance of maintaining a robust partnership.

This meeting occurs during the final stages of Obama's presidency and in the context of the upcoming presidential election, underscoring the urgency of addressing foreign policy matters before the transition of power. As both leaders navigate their complex relationship, the discussions could have lasting implications for U.S.-Israel relations and the broader pursuit of peace in the region.

Real_86-Webpage,McAuliffe hangs with Willie Nelson -- and his weed,"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana

Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert

(CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed.

It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!""

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is.

""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool.""

The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

Real_87-Webpage,The Mystery of Trump’s Man in Moscow: Carter Page,"In March, in a bold “Oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the Washington Post’s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, “I have quite a few more.” The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “Carter Page, PhD.”

Who?

Story Continued Below

Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.”

This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.

“What’s this guy’s name?” says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.

“I had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. “But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘Have you heard of this guy?’”

“Strangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,” Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. “It's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.”

Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.

This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. “I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.” As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?

Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (“I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’” says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump’s own campaign.

What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. “He’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,” says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia’s state oil giant. “People really respect him in this industry. He’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials—including Rosneft head Igor Sechin—during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.

Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at Gazprom,” the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in Russia” and an office “around the corner from Trump Tower.”

Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, “Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a “famous American economist” and “adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.”

All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in Trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.

But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to Page’s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.

So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?

***

I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page’s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.

This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.

OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn’t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive résumé.

Page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. “He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,” his bio reads. “He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.”

Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page’s tenure in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.

So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn’t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “I don’t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says Craig . “It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.”

When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page’s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, “I rolled my eyes at that one.” (He, too, said he hadn’t heard of Page until Trump’s announcement.)

Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?

Turns out, they did.

“His nickname was stranichkin,” from the Russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. “It really irritated our team,” Torchinsky told me over Skype. “We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. These guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” As for Page, “He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” Torchinsky says. “When you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.”

OK, harsh. But then I talked to Page’s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. “He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me.

Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says Aleksashenko.

When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” And, says Aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.”

Trump’s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says Aleksashenko.

***

For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,” he wrote. “Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (“Slave; Pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.

His speech in Moscow’s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “For the last 15 years, I’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak Russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: “We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.” Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.

Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. “He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “That blog post about the slaves. That’s just … strange,” says the Council member.

“He’s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. “You’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.”

***

I should’ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump’s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.

I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page’s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?

But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch’s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “No one let him into Gazprom,” Aleksashenko says. “He didn’t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller’s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.” Another of Page’s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page’s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year… I used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.”

But the meetings did provide him with something else. “Gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them.

After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father’s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from Trump Tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space.

“That’s Carter Page,” says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. “That’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. He’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.”

In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia’s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“I don’t know this person,” said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page’s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. “I give them money, I don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,” he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “Don’t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.”

“You are engaged in onanism,” said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. “It’s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It’s absurd.”

As for the FBI investigation, well, it’s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.” He added, “the story doesn't add up.” What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page’s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.”

***

I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?

“Who?” says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.

“He has no formal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.

Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks’s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?

One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.

One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump’s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,” Burt told me. “And I told him I’d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I’ve forgotten. He’s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?”

Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump’s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. “If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,” this person told me.

“I’m not answering your questions,” Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “Carter Page isn’t someone I’ve interacted with.” Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: “Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He’s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.”

Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“Who?” Maybe I wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.

“I don’t know about his Russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. “Every conversation I’ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” He went on. “I couldn’t name a project that I could connect Carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.”

“I don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but I think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.”

Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, “a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ‘I want to be part of the team,’” says the Trump adviser. And that’s how it happened. “He’s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ‘He’s an adviser.’ And now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.”

Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,” one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,” the Russia specialist recalls. “He didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.”

According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page’s trip to Russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.” But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “It’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America’s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It’s what’s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carré novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?”

This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “If Page using his status as ‘Trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: “Carter Page, Ph.D.” Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.

For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?

There doesn’t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,” Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.

In March, the political landscape shifted dramatically when then-presidential candidate Donald Trump unveiled a short list of foreign policy advisers. Among the names that raised eyebrows was Carter Page, PhD, a figure whose background and connections would soon become a focal point of controversy and scrutiny.

Carter Page is the founder of Global Energy Capital, an investment firm that claims to specialize in the energy sector with a particular focus on Russia. Page has positioned himself as an expert in the intricacies of investing in this vast and complex market, boasting a wealth of experience that he asserts qualifies him to advise Trump's campaign on energy policy and relations with Russia. However, despite his self-proclaimed expertise, many within the Russian business community appeared perplexed by his prominence. Reports indicated that a significant number of individuals in the industry had never heard of Page, raising questions about the validity of his claims and the extent of his influence.

As the narrative surrounding Page unfolded, he stated that he had been actively sending policy memos to Trump's campaign, asserting that he would play a crucial role in shaping the candidate's energy policy and strategies concerning Russia. This assertion was met with skepticism, particularly as reports began to surface indicating that U.S. intelligence agencies were probing Page for potential ties to Russian leaders. The implications of such investigations added an air of intrigue and suspicion to his involvement in the campaign.

Trump's foreign policy knowledge has been a subject of criticism and confusion, with many commentators pointing to his lack of familiarity with key groups and figures in international relations. In this context, Page's role as an adviser became even more contentious. While he was largely unknown in expert circles prior to his appointment, his inclusion on the advisory team thrust him into the spotlight, drawing attention to his controversial statements and positions.

Page's public remarks have often been provocative, including instances where he praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in stark contrast to former President Barack Obama. His criticisms of U.S. foreign policy further fueled the fire of skepticism regarding his motivations and affiliations. The juxtaposition of his views with the broader narrative of U.S. foreign relations raised questions about the coherence of Trump's foreign policy strategy and the individuals influencing it.

The scrutiny of Page extended beyond his public statements to his professional background. His tenure at Merrill Lynch, a prestigious investment bank, came under examination, with former colleagues suggesting that he was not a significant player in major deals during his time there. This characterization of Page as lacking exceptional talents or accomplishments contributed to a growing perception of him as a somewhat obscure figure in the finance world, further complicating his role in Trump's campaign.

As Page's claims of advising Gazprom, a major Russian energy company, were met with skepticism from industry insiders, the narrative surrounding him became increasingly murky. Questions emerged regarding the authenticity of his expertise in Russian energy and the legitimacy of his connections within the industry. Investigations into Page's activities, including reported meetings with individuals under U.S. sanctions, only added to the cloud of uncertainty enveloping his role.

Within Trump's campaign, there appeared to be confusion regarding Page's influence and responsibilities. Some staff members publicly denied that he held any significant sway over policy decisions, suggesting that his role might have been exaggerated in the media. This dissonance within the campaign highlighted the broader challenges Trump faced in presenting a cohesive foreign policy platform.

As the investigations into Page's connections and activities continued, the narrative surrounding him remained unclear. The juxtaposition of his self-portrayal as a knowledgeable adviser with the contrasting views of industry insiders and campaign staff painted a complex picture of a man caught in the crosshairs of political intrigue. Questions lingered about his true connections and intentions, particularly concerning the contentious relationship between Trump and Russia.

Ultimately, the saga of Carter Page serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges faced by Trump's campaign in articulating a clear and credible foreign policy. The blurred lines between perception and reality in the context of Page's involvement underscore the difficulties inherent in navigating the complex world of international relations. As investigations continue and the political landscape evolves, the legacy of Page's role in Trump's foreign policy advisory team remains a subject of ongoing debate and speculation.",27.0,-16.0,6589.0,0.12796208530805686,0.004097738655334649,818.0,-0.5333333333333333,-0.019559902200488997
Real_88-Webpage,It’s “Trump is HITLER” Month at the Washington Post – Eagle Rising,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post.

On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part,

(…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is.

Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

Six Day’s before Mr. Cohen, another columnist Shalom Auslander wrote, “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles…

The Washington Post is under fire for its negative portrayal of former President Donald Trump, drawing criticism for what some see as biased reporting. The publication has assigned a significant number of resources, with 20 reporters dedicated to investigating Trump, a move that has raised eyebrows among his supporters.

Columnists at the paper have made controversial comparisons between Trump and Adolf Hitler, igniting further debate. Richard Cohen, for instance, described Trump as ""Hitlerian in his thinking,"" although he was quick to clarify that he does not consider Trump an anti-Semite. This characterization has not only sparked outrage but has also led to accusations of double standards, particularly as Cohen's column did not address similar allegations directed at Hillary Clinton, which some perceive as a glaring bias in the coverage.

Shalom Auslander, another commentator, previously warned against making such comparisons, arguing that they diminish the historical significance of Hitler and the atrocities associated with his regime. This perspective adds another layer to the ongoing discussion about the appropriateness of using such extreme analogies in political discourse.

Real_89-Webpage,Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore,"2016 Obama’s team isn’t laughing at Trump anymore The president’s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.

They’re not laughing anymore.

Story Continued Below

Going into Monday night’s debate, Obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.

“I’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “I feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘Breaking Bad’ here. We’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.”

“There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,” said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.

Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He’s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare—support Democrats.

For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there’s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.

“We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. “But we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.”

Trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.

And the result: Trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama’s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.

Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.

“I don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, I don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.”

But they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama’s America.

“I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. “He’s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.”

For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “Trump has shattered that,” Vietor said. “He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. That’s a bad lesson for people to learn.”

According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton’s chances.

“I’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.

Not everyone’s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.

“He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.

And Democrats’ sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.

“The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,” said Earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.”

But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.

“I’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” Papa said, “than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”

As the political landscape in the United States continues to shift dramatically, the initial laughter from Barack Obama’s team at Donald Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party has morphed into a palpable anxiety about the implications of his potential presidency. What was once perceived as an amusing spectacle has transformed into a source of concern, reflecting deeper issues within the American electorate and the political discourse at large.

In the wake of Trump’s ascendance, there is a growing unease among former aides and advisors to President Obama regarding the broader discontent that seems to be fueling Trump’s popularity. This sentiment challenges previous assumptions about the electorate that many had held, suggesting that a significant portion of the American populace feels disconnected from the policies and ideals championed by the Obama administration. Many former aides have expressed feelings of terror and frustration, recognizing that a substantial number of Americans may not have resonated with the progressive policies that Obama fought to implement during his presidency.

Privately, Obama himself has been reflecting on his mixed feelings regarding Trump’s rise. The humor that once accompanied Trump’s antics has given way to disappointment, as the former president grapples with the reality that many voter needs remain unaddressed. This duality of amusement and disappointment speaks to a broader concern about the political climate, where Trump’s success in mainstreaming racist rhetoric and appealing to the fears of certain demographics has highlighted a division in America that Obama’s team had previously underestimated.

Recent polls indicate a tightening race between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, with significant support for Trump in crucial battleground states. This electoral landscape has intensified the urgency for Obama’s team, as they recognize the implications of a potential Trump presidency on the future of American politics. What was once a source of jest—Trump’s ability to dominate the GOP—now feels like a stark reality that could reshape the political fabric of the nation.

Former aides have shifted their perspectives, now rejecting the notion that Trump’s legacy is intertwined with Obama’s own. Instead, they express concern about the long-term impact of Trump’s political style, which many believe has damaged the quality of political discourse in the country. The divisive nature of Trump’s rhetoric and the normalization of extremist views have left a lingering sense of unease among those who once served in the Obama administration.

In conversations, Obama has articulated a desire for a functional opposition that could engage in meaningful discussions to address key issues facing the nation. However, he also feels a profound sense of lost opportunity in terms of political negotiations, lamenting the inability to bridge divides and find common ground in an increasingly polarized environment. This longing for productive political engagement underscores the frustration felt by many who believe that the current state of American politics has strayed far from the ideals of constructive debate and collaboration.

Despite these challenges, some former aides maintain a sense of schadenfreude regarding Trump’s divisiveness within the GOP. They observe the implications of this internal strife for the future of the Republican Party, noting that Trump’s rise has not only transformed the party’s identity but has also exposed fractures that may have long-term consequences. The ongoing struggle within the GOP to reconcile traditional conservative values with Trump’s populist approach presents an intriguing dynamic for political observers.

Democrats continue to critique the GOP’s economic positions, asserting that the Tea Party movement, which significantly influenced Republican politics in recent years, lacks intellectual credibility. This critique reflects a broader frustration with the direction of the GOP and the implications of its policies on the American populace. The ongoing dialogue surrounding economic issues, coupled with the rise of extremist views, has left many feeling disillusioned about the future of political discourse in the country.

Overall, there exists a shared grief among Obama’s team regarding the current state of American politics. The rise of extremist views and the normalization of divisive rhetoric have created an atmosphere of uncertainty and anxiety. As they reflect on the political landscape, former aides recognize the challenges ahead and the need for a concerted effort to address the underlying issues that have led to such discontent among voters.

In this moment of reflection, the Obama team’s concerns serve as a reminder of the complexities of the American political landscape. The rise of Trump has not only reshaped the Republican Party but has also forced a reevaluation of the assumptions that many held about the electorate and the state of political discourse. As the nation moves forward, the lessons learned from this tumultuous period will undoubtedly influence the strategies and approaches of political leaders in the years to come.

As the election approaches, the stakes have never been higher. The anxiety felt by Obama’s team is indicative of a broader sentiment shared by many Americans who fear the implications of a Trump presidency. The desire for unity, understanding, and constructive dialogue remains paramount, as the nation grapples with the challenges posed by a deeply divided political landscape. In the face of uncertainty, the hope for a return to civility and reasoned discourse persists, even as the specter of extremism looms large over the future of American politics. 

In conclusion, the reflections of Obama’s aides encapsulate a moment of reckoning for the Democratic Party and the nation as a whole. The rise of Trump has illuminated significant fractures within American society, prompting a reevaluation of political strategies and the need for genuine engagement with the electorate. As the political environment continues to evolve, the lessons learned from this period will shape the future of American democracy and the ongoing struggle for a more inclusive and equitable political discourse.",-9.0,-10.0,1354.0,-0.24324324324324326,-0.0066469719350073855,1079.0,-0.2777777777777778,-0.009267840593141797

Real_90-Webpage,Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

“Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”

Adding:

“This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”

Chelsea then said:

“Stop telling women to smile. We don’t like that. It’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”

Going for Priebus’ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

“You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.”

And that’s exactly right.

In a growing conversation about gender dynamics, many women express their frustration over being told to smile by men. This unsolicited advice, often delivered in various social contexts, has sparked criticism and reflection on the underlying implications of such comments.

A recent incident brought this issue to the forefront when RNC Chair Reince Priebus commented on Hillary Clinton's demeanor during an NBC forum. His remarks seemed to suggest that Clinton's serious expression warranted a call for a smile, igniting a debate on whether men have the same expectations placed upon them. After all, do men smile all the time? The answer is likely no, as constant smiling may raise eyebrows and appear suspicious.

Chelsea Handler, comedian and host, addressed Priebus's comments on her Netflix show, questioning his authority to dictate how women should express themselves. Handler emphasized that telling women to smile is not only belittling but also unwelcome. She articulated that such remarks are ""deal breakers"" rather than icebreakers, highlighting the frustration many women feel when confronted with this directive.

In a humorous twist, Handler noted that women might just smile when Hillary Clinton overcomes her health issues and emerges victorious against Donald Trump in the upcoming election. This lighthearted comment underscores the serious undertones of the discussion, as it reflects the broader societal expectations placed on women and their expressions.

As the dialogue continues, it is clear that the call for women to smile is increasingly seen as an outdated and unwelcome expectation, prompting many to advocate for a shift in how society perceives and interacts with women's emotions.",15.0,13.0,299.0,1.0714285714285714,0.05016722408026756,306.0,1.0833333333333333,0.042483660130718956
Real_91-Webpage,Is Donald Trump qualified to be president?,"Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.

H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.”

Likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.

Story Continued Below

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.

But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump’s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?

1. Does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country?

Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump — who swooned after Clinton’s superb convention in Philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.

His resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.

The first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream.

This is not to suggest that Trump can’t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.

Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates — but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care.

The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. “When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.”

Stone argued that Trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.

Trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.

Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD’s Section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?

2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?

Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: “We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.”

That’s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: “For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “Article 12 of the Constitution.” The framers stopped at seven. “He was just listing out numbers,” said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. “I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.”

OK, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “Free Exercise” clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.

3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?

Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.

But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.

Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much).

More serious is the issue of Trump’s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns.

This isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.

4. What’s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there’s the matter of Trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In exposé after exposé, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.

The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.

5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.

But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.

Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary” in Trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.

But it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially George W. Bush’s claims about Iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read POLITICO’s comprehensive “Donald Trump’s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths” for a taste.)

In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “Clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…”

But getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. It’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.

As the political landscape heats up in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, the first presidential debate emerges as a pivotal moment for Donald Trump. For many observers, this debate represents more than just a series of questions and answers; it serves as a crucial job interview for a candidate whose public persona remains largely opaque. With the stakes high, both candidates are poised to reveal their qualifications and address pressing concerns that voters have about their leadership abilities.

For Donald Trump, the debate is an opportunity to transition from a campaign focused on rallies and soundbites to a more substantive discussion about his readiness to govern. Historically unpopular among voters, Trump has nevertheless managed to close the gap with his opponent, Hillary Clinton, particularly in battleground states. Recent polls indicate that despite his untested status and perceived lack of depth in domestic and foreign affairs, he is gaining traction as the election approaches.

Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, enters the debate with her own set of challenges. She must counter long-standing perceptions of dishonesty that have dogged her campaign and demonstrate her qualifications to lead the nation. The debate is not just a chance for Trump to prove himself; it is also a critical moment for Clinton to reinforce her credibility and reassure voters of her capability to handle the responsibilities of the presidency.

Trump's untested candidacy raises several questions about his qualifications. Observers note that he has previously displayed a concerning lack of understanding of key issues. For instance, his unfamiliarity with significant global events, such as Russia's annexation of Crimea, has led many to question whether he possesses the knowledge necessary for effective governance. This lack of awareness could prove detrimental in a debate setting where foreign policy and national security are likely to be focal points.

In addition to his knowledge gaps, Trump's respect for American Constitutional principles has come under scrutiny. His comments regarding press freedom and misunderstandings of constitutional articles have raised alarms among constitutional scholars and political analysts alike. Voters are left wondering whether he truly understands the foundational tenets of American democracy and whether he can be trusted to uphold them.

Transparency and credibility are also critical themes in the conversation surrounding Trump. His refusal to disclose personal financial information has sparked concerns about his willingness to be open with the electorate. In a political climate that increasingly values transparency, Trump's reluctance to share details about his finances raises red flags for voters who expect accountability from their leaders.

Moreover, the operations of Trump's charitable foundation have come under scrutiny, with questions about the accountability of donations and the foundation's overall effectiveness. The lack of clarity surrounding these issues only compounds concerns about his integrity as a candidate. Voters are left to ponder whether Trump can be trusted to handle the nation's finances and charitable endeavors with the same level of scrutiny he has faced regarding his own organization.

Finally, Trump's pattern of dishonesty and factual inaccuracies has become a significant point of contention. His frequent misrepresentations and the spread of misinformation have led many to question his integrity and commitment to truthfulness. In an era where voters are increasingly discerning about the character of their leaders, this pattern of behavior raises serious concerns about whether Trump is fit to occupy the highest office in the land.

The irony of the Republican Party nominating a candidate with such a significant record of misrepresentation is not lost on political analysts. Traditionally, the party has prided itself on advocating for principles of honesty, integrity, and accountability. Yet, in Trump, the party has chosen a candidate whose history stands in stark contrast to these values. This paradox presents a unique challenge for the GOP as it seeks to rally its base and attract undecided voters.

As the debate approaches, both candidates must grapple with the weight of their respective histories and the expectations of the American electorate. For Trump, the debate serves as an opportunity to dispel doubts about his qualifications and demonstrate his readiness to lead. For Clinton, it is a chance to reaffirm her credibility and counteract perceptions that have plagued her campaign.

In conclusion, the first presidential debate of the 2016 election is set to be a defining moment in the race for the White House. With significant implications for both candidates, the debate will likely shift the focus from traditional campaigning to a critical assessment of Trump's readiness to govern. As voters tune in, they will be looking for clarity, transparency, and a demonstration of leadership qualities that can inspire confidence in the next president of the United States.",18.0,34.0,2547.0,0.21686746987951808,0.007067137809187279,865.0,0.9714285714285714,0.03930635838150289
