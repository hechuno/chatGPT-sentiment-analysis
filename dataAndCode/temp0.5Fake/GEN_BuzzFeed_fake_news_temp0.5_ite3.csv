Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Bill Clinton's recent comments regarding donors to the Clinton Foundation seeking favors have ignited a wave of negative headlines, raising concerns about the impact on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The former president's remarks were interpreted by many as an acknowledgment of the potential for conflict of interest, leading to speculation about how this could affect his wife’s candidacy.

In a clarifying statement, Bill Clinton emphasized that it is natural for allies and supporters to ask for favors; however, he was quick to assert that such requests do not guarantee favorable outcomes. This distinction aims to mitigate the implications of his initial comments, which some critics interpreted as an admission of impropriety within the foundation's operations.

The controversy surrounding the Clinton Foundation has been fueled by leaked emails that suggest some donors were granted meetings with high-ranking officials. While this has raised eyebrows and led to questions about the ethics of the foundation's practices, it is crucial to note that there is currently no evidence to support claims of a ""pay to play"" scheme. The absence of concrete proof regarding any wrongdoing has led some supporters to argue that the scrutiny faced by the Clinton Foundation is disproportionate.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump's charitable foundation has come under its own cloud of scrutiny. Reports indicate that Trump has not personally donated to his foundation since 2008, raising questions about his commitment to charitable giving. Furthermore, allegations have emerged suggesting that Trump may have used funds from his charitable foundation for personal purchases, prompting concerns about potential impropriety and mismanagement.

The New York Attorney General is currently investigating the Trump Foundation for possible violations of charity laws, which could have serious implications for the organization and its operations. This investigation highlights a growing sentiment among critics that Trump's charitable activities are not being held to the same standards as those of the Clinton Foundation.

Media coverage of both candidates has drawn criticism for what some perceive as a ""double standard."" Recent reports suggest that Hillary Clinton's health issues have received significantly more attention from the media compared to the controversies surrounding the Trump Foundation. This discrepancy in coverage has led to accusations of bias, with many arguing that the media's focus on Clinton's personal health detracts from the pressing issues surrounding Trump's charitable dealings.

The perceived bias in media coverage is believed to be benefiting Trump while simultaneously harming Clinton's campaign. As the election draws closer, the implications of these narratives could play a crucial role in shaping public perception of both candidates. The contrasting treatment of the Clinton and Trump foundations raises important questions about the role of the media in politics and the influence it wields over public opinion.

As the campaign continues, the implications of Bill Clinton's comments and the ongoing investigations into Trump's charitable foundation will likely remain focal points of debate. The intersection of politics, charity, and media coverage underscores the complexities of the current electoral landscape. With both candidates facing scrutiny for their respective foundations, voters are left to navigate a convoluted narrative that could ultimately influence their decisions at the ballot box.

In the coming weeks, it will be essential for both campaigns to address these issues head-on. For Hillary Clinton, countering the narrative surrounding the foundation will be crucial to maintaining momentum in her campaign. For Donald Trump, the ongoing investigation into his foundation presents a significant challenge that could undermine his credibility as a candidate.

As voters seek transparency and accountability from their leaders, the contrasting stories of the Clinton and Trump foundations serve as a reminder of the intricate relationship between charity, politics, and media. With the election on the horizon, the scrutiny on both candidates is only expected to intensify, making it imperative for them to navigate these challenges effectively. The outcome of this election may hinge not only on policy proposals and campaign strategies but also on how each candidate manages the narratives surrounding their respective charitable endeavors.",6.0,7.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,750.0,0.25925925925925924,0.009333333333333334
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, asserting that former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) may have distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications across sub-Saharan Africa, potentially increasing the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients. The report, titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee, who has taken a keen interest in scrutinizing the implications of the initiative.

CHAI has long been regarded as one of the most significant projects of the Clinton Foundation, aimed at providing support and medication to individuals affected by HIV/AIDS. However, the revelations in this report could pose serious challenges to the foundation's reputation, particularly as Hillary Clinton gears up for her presidential campaign.

At the heart of the report are allegations concerning Clinton's relationship with Ranbaxy, an Indian drug manufacturer that has been a primary distributor of HIV/AIDS drugs for CHAI. Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower from Ranbaxy, has played a pivotal role in exposing the company's malpractices, which culminated in a landmark lawsuit against the firm. Ranbaxy pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts related to drug adulteration, resulting in a significant $500 million fine imposed by the Department of Justice (DOJ).

The DOJ's findings revealed that Ranbaxy's diluted drugs posed heightened health risks to patients relying on these essential medications. Rep. Blackburn has raised grave concerns regarding the potential loss of lives that could stem from the distribution of substandard drugs, emphasizing the critical nature of the issue at hand. 

The report also suggests that CHAI's actions may invite renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, especially in light of Hillary Clinton's political aspirations. The timing of these allegations could have significant implications for her campaign, as they bring to the forefront questions about the integrity and efficacy of the foundation's initiatives.

In addition to the concerns over drug quality, the study points to troubling ties between Bill Clinton and several controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated by regulatory agencies. Ranbaxy's history of drug quality issues dates back to at least 2004, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings regarding irregularities in their drugs. Despite these warnings and the subsequent ban on Ranbaxy's drugs in the United States, CHAI has continued to distribute their HIV/AIDS medications abroad, raising further questions about the oversight and accountability within the initiative.

Dinesh Thakur has been vocal in his criticism of CHAI, claiming that the organization has failed to adequately address the quality of drugs being distributed. He has expressed frustration over CHAI's lack of engagement with him regarding his concerns, suggesting a disconnect between the initiative's goals and the realities faced by patients.

Although CHAI spun off from the Clinton Foundation in 2010, the two entities remain closely linked, sharing board members and continuing to operate in tandem. This relationship raises additional questions about the foundation's influence over CHAI's operations and decision-making processes.

The report also suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards for drug manufacturing through an executive order issued in 2000. This potential alteration in standards could have had far-reaching consequences, enabling manufacturers like Ranbaxy and others to profit significantly from U.S. government initiatives aimed at AIDS relief.

Moreover, the study delves into potential corruption and the benefits that the Clinton Foundation may have reaped from its relationships with various entities, further complicating the narrative surrounding CHAI's operations. Rep. Blackburn has expressed particular concern over the emotional toll that the foundation's actions may have taken on patients and healthcare workers. She highlighted the false hopes created by the distribution of substandard medications, which could lead to devastating outcomes for those affected by HIV/AIDS.

As the draft report circulates, it has the potential to ignite a renewed debate over the role of non-profit organizations in global health initiatives and the ethical responsibilities that come with such endeavors. The implications of the findings could extend beyond the Clinton Foundation, prompting broader discussions about accountability in the pharmaceutical industry and the necessity of stringent quality controls for life-saving medications.

In light of these revelations, advocates for public health and transparency are calling for a thorough investigation into the practices of CHAI and its partnerships with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The stakes are high, as the lives of countless individuals depend on the integrity of the medications they receive.

As the political landscape shifts and the 2024 presidential campaign approaches, the fallout from this report may have lasting effects on the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives. With increasing scrutiny on the foundation's past actions, the need for transparency and accountability has never been more pressing.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report raises serious questions about the quality of HIV/AIDS drugs distributed by the Clinton Health Access Initiative and the potential consequences for patients in sub-Saharan Africa. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how these allegations will impact the Clinton Foundation and the broader conversation surrounding global health initiatives. The emotional and physical well-being of those affected by HIV/AIDS hangs in the balance, underscoring the urgency of addressing these critical issues.",-6.0,-3.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,957.0,-0.09375,-0.003134796238244514
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a dramatic turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City. The incident raised immediate concerns about her health, prompting a flurry of speculation about her ability to participate in the ongoing presidential campaign.

Shortly after the incident, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her demeanor. Clinton appeared noticeably energetic and lighter, a stark contrast to the distressing scene just hours earlier. However, this sudden change in appearance has led to further scrutiny and skepticism regarding her health and public engagements.

Several observers commented on a significant difference in Clinton's physical appearance, particularly noting a change in her nose shape. The article claims that the individual seen at Chelsea’s apartment bore a resemblance to a ""clone"" of Hillary, characterized by a Roman-type nose, diverging from the real Hillary’s Nordic nose. Additionally, this figure appeared younger and notably lacked a mole that the real Hillary has above her lip, further fueling the speculation surrounding her public appearances.

As discussions surrounding Clinton’s health continue, speculation has arisen that this ""clone"" may take on a more prominent role in handling campaign appearances due to concerns over Clinton's well-being. Observers have pointed out indicators that suggest this clone is not only thinner but also appears to be free of health issues that have previously plagued Clinton, such as persistent cough or hoarseness. This has led to questions about whether the real Hillary will be involved in any potential presidency or if her double will manage public engagements on her behalf.

The implications of this speculation extend beyond mere appearances. Concerns have been raised about Clinton's capability to participate in upcoming debates with her opponent, Donald Trump. Given the physical demands and pressures of such events, many are questioning whether she can adequately represent herself and her campaign in this critical moment.

The article further suggests a scenario in which Hillary Clinton's administration could operate without her actual presence. In this hypothetical situation, decisions could be made by her cabinet while the public is presented with a figurehead, raising concerns about the authenticity of leadership in a potential Clinton presidency. This notion draws parallels to concerns expressed during President Obama’s administration, where some critics suggested that the presidency was being managed by others behind the scenes.

As the narrative unfolds, the speculation surrounding Hillary Clinton’s health and the implications of her potential ""clone"" raises important questions about the nature of political representation and the authenticity of public figures. The idea that a double could assume responsibilities typically held by a candidate has sparked debate about the integrity of the electoral process and the expectations of voters.

While these views are expressed by the article's author and not necessarily endorsed by EagleRising.com, the concerns raised highlight a growing anxiety among the public regarding the transparency and health of political candidates. As the campaign progresses, it remains to be seen how Clinton’s health will impact her ability to engage with voters and fulfill her role as a candidate.

In a political landscape where appearances can significantly influence public perception, the ongoing discussions surrounding Hillary Clinton and her health will likely remain a focal point as the election approaches. With the stakes higher than ever, the electorate is left to ponder the implications of a candidate who may not be able to fully participate in the rigors of campaigning and governance.",8.0,10.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,666.0,0.43478260869565216,0.015015015015015015
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In the lead-up to the upcoming election, Donald Trump has sparked intense debate and concern with his controversial statements regarding immigration and terrorism. His proposals, which include building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and creating a national registry for Muslims, have raised alarms among various communities and political analysts alike.

Trump's bold assertions extend beyond policy proposals to extreme measures that many find alarming. He has suggested that the families of terrorists should be targeted for murder, a stance that has drawn widespread condemnation. Furthermore, he has proposed the idea of rounding up Muslims and placing them into concentration camps, a notion that echoes some of the darkest chapters of history and raises ethical and moral questions about the treatment of individuals based solely on their religion.

The rhetoric employed by Trump is not merely personal opinion; it is supported by his campaign's strategic communications. His Senior Communications Advisor has articulated that Trump aims to combat what they term the ""narratives"" propagated by former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This focus on promoting a more aggressive stance against terrorism is central to Trump's campaign messaging.

Criticism of the Obama administration features prominently in Trump's narrative. He has accused the administration of permitting immigrants from dangerous countries to gain U.S. citizenship and has condemned the increase in Syrian refugee intake. Trump contends that the threat of radical Islamic terrorism has escalated under the leadership of Obama and Clinton, arguing that a more proactive approach is necessary to dismantle terrorist networks before they can inflict harm on American soil.

Trump's comments have also placed a spotlight on the Muslim community in the United States. He has repeatedly suggested that Muslims, as a group, bear responsibility for terrorist attacks and has implied that they are not doing enough to report suspicious activities to authorities. This generalization has raised serious concerns about the implications for Muslims in America, particularly regarding how Trump would define terrorism and the potential repercussions for those who may be unfairly targeted as a result.

Critics warn that Trump's incendiary rhetoric carries the risk of fostering an environment of fear and division. The potential for extreme actions, should he assume office, looms large in the minds of many. The fear is that such statements could embolden individuals or groups to take matters into their own hands, leading to increased discrimination and violence against innocent people based on their faith or ethnicity.

In light of these developments, the urgency for civic engagement has never been more pronounced. As the election approaches, the author urges readers to recognize the implications of Trump's statements and to take action to prevent his ascension to the presidency. The call to vote is presented as a crucial step in ensuring that the values of inclusivity and tolerance are upheld in the face of rhetoric that seeks to divide.

The upcoming election is not merely a contest of policies but a referendum on the direction the nation wishes to take regarding issues of immigration, national security, and civil rights. The stakes are high, and the rhetoric surrounding these topics will undoubtedly shape the future of American society.

As citizens prepare to cast their votes, it is essential to reflect on the broader implications of the candidates' statements and actions. The choice made at the ballot box will resonate far beyond the immediate political landscape; it will influence the nation's identity and values for generations to come.

In conclusion, the controversial statements made by Donald Trump regarding immigration and terrorism have ignited a firestorm of debate and concern. His proposals and rhetoric pose significant questions about the treatment of Muslims in America and the potential for extreme actions should he be elected. As the election nears, the author emphasizes the importance of voting as a means to safeguard the principles of justice and equality that are foundational to American democracy. The time to act is now, and every vote counts in shaping the future of the nation.",-71.0,-24.0,888.0,-2.2903225806451615,-0.07995495495495496,744.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.03225806451612903

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, advocating for a One World Government and globalization.

He highlighted that violence and poverty are at historic lows, underscoring the need to recognize these achievements to sustain progress.

However, Obama called for a ""course correction"" in the current trajectory of global integration, cautioning against complacency. He criticized those who ignore persistent inequalities and the rising allure of ethnic and sectarian identities, which can undermine unity. 

Furthermore, the president pointed out that many government institutions are ill-equipped to navigate the transformative changes brought about by globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

The Clinton Foundation is under fire as allegations of pay-to-play corruption surface, suggesting that political access has been granted to donors in exchange for their financial contributions. This controversy has raised questions about the foundation's operations and its impact on the Clintons' political and personal fortunes.

In response to these serious allegations, the Clinton campaign has sought to highlight the foundation's charitable work. However, critics argue that the foundation primarily serves the interests of the Clinton family and their associates, rather than fulfilling its stated mission to provide global humanitarian aid.

Financial scrutiny of the foundation's operations reveals a troubling picture. According to IRS filings from 2014, only 5.7% of the foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants. This figure is striking, especially considering that the foundation's total spending that year reached nearly $91.3 million. Of that amount, less than $5.2 million was directed toward charity, raising eyebrows among watchdogs and critics alike.

The financial breakdown for 2014 shows that the foundation spent a significant $34.8 million on salaries and employee benefits. Additionally, a staggering $50.4 million was categorized under ""other expenses."" This distribution of funds has led to accusations that the foundation's operations are less about philanthropy and more about generating substantial income for the Clintons and their inner circle.

Compounding these concerns, charitable spending reportedly decreased by 40% in 2014, even as the foundation enjoyed an additional $30 million in revenue. This paradoxical trend has prompted further questions about the foundation's priorities and financial management. Notably, salaries and benefits saw an increase of $5 million, and ""other expenses"" rose by an equal amount, indicating a pattern of escalating operational costs that overshadow charitable contributions.

The allegations of pay-to-play corruption and the foundation's financial practices have sparked a broader debate about the ethics of political fundraising and the role of charitable organizations in political influence. As the Clinton Foundation continues to navigate these challenges, the implications of its operations and the scrutiny it faces could have lasting effects on the Clintons' legacy and public perception.

In light of these developments, the foundation's future remains uncertain, and the public will be watching closely as the situation unfolds. The ongoing discourse surrounding the foundation underscores the complex intersection of philanthropy and politics in contemporary America.",25.0,-3.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,445.0,-0.16666666666666666,-0.006741573033707865
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

The incident at the memorial, where she convulsed and required assistance to enter her van, raised concerns about her health. Initially, her campaign attributed the episode to the heat, but it was later revealed that the temperature in New York City that day was a mild 74 degrees.

Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea's apartment, passing several hospitals on the way, which fueled speculation about the nature of her condition. The Greensboro rally, intended to bolster her campaign, faced scrutiny as questions emerged regarding its authenticity. Observers noted unusual camera placements within the audience, leading to allegations that the event might have been staged.

Further analysis of video footage suggested that the audience appeared faked, prompting a wave of skepticism about the rally's legitimacy. However, a C-Span video was referenced to confirm that the original videos capturing the event were not doctored, attempting to quell the growing doubts.

Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the film industry gears up for the release of the highly anticipated fictional film ""Weekend at Chelsea's,"" conversations surrounding the film have sparked a broader dialogue about the health and political viability of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The film, which is said to be a satirical take on the life of the former presidential candidate, has drawn attention not only for its comedic elements but also for its timing amidst ongoing scrutiny of Clinton's health.

Critics have long debated the media's portrayal of Clinton's health issues, often oscillating between concern and skepticism. While some have raised alarms about her well-being, others dismiss these claims as exaggerated or unfounded. The narrative surrounding Clinton’s health has become a contentious topic, particularly as whispers of serious ailments have emerged, only to be downplayed by her supporters as minor inconveniences.

A key figure in this ongoing saga is Clinton's long-time physician, who has been a constant presence during her medical emergencies. This relationship has fueled speculation about the severity of her health concerns. Reports have suggested that Clinton may be suffering from conditions such as seizures and possibly Parkinson's disease, leading to accusations of dishonesty regarding her overall health and fitness for the presidency.

As Clinton’s health continues to be a focal point of public discussion, her declining poll numbers add another layer of complexity to her political narrative. Recent controversial remarks made by Clinton have further complicated her standing among voters, leading to a mixed reception from the public. Observers have noted that these declining numbers may reflect a broader skepticism about her candidacy, particularly in light of her health struggles.

The critique extends beyond her health issues to Clinton's past associations and statements regarding race. These elements have resurfaced in discussions about her suitability for office and have contributed to a growing divide among her supporters and detractors. Many express mixed feelings towards her struggles, torn between a desire for her personal well-being and concerns about her capability to lead.

Clinton's lifelong ambition to become president is well-documented, and her determination has been evident throughout her political career. Despite facing numerous challenges, including the scrutiny of her health, there remains a suggestion that her campaign may still succeed. Supporters argue that her experience and resilience could ultimately outweigh the concerns surrounding her health, allowing her to maintain a competitive edge in the political arena.

However, there is also a palpable hope among some that Clinton's political career may come to an end. This sentiment, while rooted in a desire for her to prioritize her health and personal well-being, also reflects a broader frustration with her political trajectory. The duality of wishing for her success while also hoping for the conclusion of her political journey encapsulates the complexity of public sentiment towards Clinton.

In light of these discussions, it is essential to acknowledge that the views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the stance of the publication. The anticipation for ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" serves as a backdrop for a much larger narrative surrounding Hillary Clinton, her health, and her enduring presence in American politics. As the film approaches its release, the intersection of entertainment and political discourse continues to unfold, inviting audiences to reflect on the implications of health, ambition, and public perception in the realm of leadership.",-18.0,6.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,641.0,0.2608695652173913,0.0093603744149766

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a final address that stirred considerable debate, former President Barack Obama expressed profound doubts about the ability to defeat ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups during a speech at the United Nations Assembly. His remarks underscored a critical perspective on the limitations of U.S. military power in addressing these persistent threats.

During his address, Obama referred to these extremist organizations as a ""JV team,"" highlighting the challenges faced by conventional military forces in combating unconventional warfare and ideologically driven violence. This characterization has led to backlash from various quarters, with critics arguing that such terminology undermines the seriousness of the threat posed by radical groups.

One of the core themes of Obama's speech was the assertion that no external power can enforce coexistence among diverse religious or ethnic communities. He argued that the root causes of conflict must be addressed through honest dialogue and understanding, rather than through military intervention. This perspective reflects a broader belief in the necessity of diplomacy over the reliance on military solutions, especially in complex conflict zones.

In discussing the ongoing violence in areas like Syria, Obama called for a renewed commitment to diplomatic efforts aimed at delivering humanitarian aid and supporting political settlements. He emphasized that a collaborative approach, rather than a solely militaristic one, is essential for achieving lasting peace and stability in regions plagued by conflict.

However, his remarks have not gone without criticism. Many argue that acknowledging the connection between radical Islam and violence is crucial for developing effective strategies to counteract these threats. Critics contend that a failure to confront the ideological underpinnings of radicalism may lead to ineffective responses and a lack of accountability in addressing the root causes of extremism.

The article highlights a growing call for a more assertive approach to dealing with the threat of radical Islam. Detractors of Obama's stance have voiced concerns that a defeatist attitude may embolden extremist groups and hinder progress in combating their influence. They argue that a stronger acknowledgment of the challenges posed by radical ideologies is necessary to foster a robust response.

As the world grapples with the complexities of modern conflict, Obama's address serves as a reminder of the multifaceted nature of the fight against extremism. The need for a balanced strategy that incorporates both diplomatic efforts and a clear-eyed assessment of the threats posed by radical ideologies is more pressing than ever.

In light of the ongoing challenges posed by groups like ISIS, the call for action becomes increasingly important. Engaging in discussions and promoting awareness about the realities of radical Islam can help galvanize support for more effective measures.

Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have unveiled that the rise of ISIS was anticipated by the CIA and DIA as early as 2012. This revelation raises critical questions about the actions taken by the Obama Administration during a tumultuous period in the Middle East.

According to the documents, the administration allegedly created conditions that allowed ISIS to isolate the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad. Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed asserts that support from Western nations, Turkey, and Gulf states for Takfiri militants was predicted to culminate in the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. These insights suggest a deliberate strategy that aimed to destabilize Assad's regime, despite the clear risks associated with empowering violent Islamist groups.

The documents also highlight significant miscalculations within the Obama Administration. President Obama famously referred to ISIS as a ""JV"" team, a characterization that now appears deeply flawed in light of the group's rapid expansion. Furthermore, the decision not to maintain a residual U.S. military force in Iraq is viewed as a critical error that may have contributed to the conditions enabling ISIS's emergence.

In addition to the revelations about ISIS, the documents shed light on U.S. weapons operations in Libya prior to the 2012 Benghazi attack. It was noted that American intelligence was aware of weapons being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports, a detail that underscores the complexities of U.S. involvement in the region.

The implications of these findings suggest that American servicemen and women may have been sacrificed due to a covert Middle Eastern policy that inadvertently facilitated the rise of ISIS. Critics argue that the administration's focus on concealment over national security could have dire consequences for both regional stability and U.S. interests.

As the world grapples with the ongoing ramifications of ISIS's rise, these declassified documents serve as a stark reminder of the complexities and unintended consequences of foreign policy decisions in volatile regions. The insights they provide could shape future discussions about U.S. engagement in the Middle East and the lessons learned from past actions.",-27.0,-7.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,384.0,-0.5,-0.018229166666666668
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed shortly before entering her van after participating in a ceremony commemorating the September 11 attacks in New York City. The incident raised immediate concerns about her health and ability to engage in the rigors of a presidential campaign, especially as she gears up for a potential face-off against Donald Trump.

Shortly after her collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her demeanor and appearance. Witnesses described her as appearing notably more energetic and lighter than before, leading to speculation about her health and well-being. However, it was not just her energy levels that caught the attention of onlookers; many remarked on a distinct change in her facial features.

Several observers pointed out that Clinton's nose appeared different, suggesting that it may have undergone a type of rhinoplasty. This observation sparked a wave of speculation regarding the authenticity of the person seen at the apartment. Some have drawn comparisons between the appearance of this individual and the Hillary Clinton that the public has known. The so-called “clone” of Hillary Clinton reportedly features a Roman-type nose, contrasting sharply with the real Hillary’s straight Nordic nose. This apparent alteration has led to further questions about the identity of the individual who has recently been in the public eye.

Adding to the intrigue, the stand-in for Clinton appears younger and lacks a mole that has been a distinctive feature of the real Hillary, located above her right lip. Such discrepancies have prompted observers to wonder about the implications for Clinton’s campaign and her ability to participate in debates and public appearances. As the political landscape heats up, the question looms: will the real Hillary Clinton be able to take the stage against Donald Trump, or will the public only see her clone?

The situation has led to a growing concern among supporters and critics alike about the transparency of Clinton's campaign. Observers are being urged to remain vigilant and watch for signs that could distinguish between the real Hillary Clinton and her clone during public appearances. The potential for a lack of transparency raises significant questions about the nature of leadership and the authenticity of the candidate.

Furthermore, speculation has emerged regarding the possibility of the Clinton Administration functioning without the real Hillary Clinton should she be elected President. Some suggest that critical decisions could be made by her cabinet while the clone handles public duties, raising ethical concerns about the transparency and accountability of a potential administration.

This situation has drawn comparisons to past speculation surrounding former President Barack Obama, where questions of transparency and authenticity were frequently debated. The implications of such a scenario, where a stand-in may be handling public duties, ignite concerns about the integrity of political leadership and the trustworthiness of elected officials.

As the political climate continues to evolve, the uncertainty surrounding Hillary Clinton’s health and the authenticity of her public appearances remains a focal point of discussion. The public is left to ponder the ramifications of these developments on her campaign and the overall political landscape.

Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent developments surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have ignited speculation about her health, with rumors suggesting she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. A video that surfaced recently shows Clinton struggling to control her eye movements, raising eyebrows and prompting discussions about her well-being.

Adding to the concerns, Clinton abruptly canceled a fundraiser in North Carolina that was scheduled for the same day as the video incident. This cancellation has led many to question her current state, especially as research indicates that Clinton has only one rally planned between September 20 and October 19, with no speaking engagements at fundraisers during this period. In stark contrast, former President Donald Trump has four rallies scheduled between September 20 and 22, highlighting a stark difference in campaign activity.

Further raising alarms, there have been reports of Clinton requiring Secret Service assistance to navigate two steps during a recent appearance. This incident has compounded worries about her health, with predictions suggesting that her issues may become increasingly apparent in the coming weeks, potentially leading to a public meltdown.

In light of these concerns, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly exploring potential replacements for Clinton as the primary candidate. However, the search for alternatives has proven challenging, particularly with Bernie Sanders being viewed as unenthusiastic about pursuing another presidential run. This situation complicates the DNC's options, as Clinton has been positioned as the primary candidate, raising questions about the integrity and stability of the party's leadership.

Speculation about Clinton's health continues to swirl, with some claiming there may be a cover-up that could expose deeper issues within the Democratic Party. As the situation unfolds, there is growing anticipation for more developments in the coming days, with many observers keenly watching how the DNC will respond to these mounting pressures.

As the political landscape shifts, the implications of Clinton's health and the DNC's potential search for a new candidate could have significant ramifications for the upcoming election cycle. The eyes of the nation remain fixed on this developing story, as both supporters and critics await clarity on Clinton’s situation and the future direction of the Democratic Party.",-8.0,-3.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,412.0,-0.21428571428571427,-0.007281553398058253
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the hushed corridors of the White House, late one night, a restless Barack Obama found himself grappling with a profound sense of discomfort. The usual tranquility of the presidential residence was disrupted by an array of noises that seemed to echo through the West Wing, preventing him from finding solace in sleep. Seeking a reprieve, he wandered the dimly lit hallways, his mind racing and thoughts swirling.

During his midnight stroll, Obama’s gaze fell upon a curious word that seemed to leap off the page of a document left unattended on a desk: ""ISIS."" Intrigued, he reached for a Post-It note and jotted down the word, unaware of the significant implications it would later hold. Little did he know that this seemingly innocuous moment would serve as the catalyst for an extraordinary series of events that would unfold in the months to come.

Fast forward to a vibrant atmosphere at Coachella, where the pulsating beats of music filled the air and the spirit of creativity ran high. Surrounded by a sea of festival-goers, Obama found himself swept away by the energy of the crowd, enhanced by the effects of a little molly. In this euphoric state, inspiration struck him like a lightning bolt: he envisioned the inception of an international terrorist organization named ISIS. The idea, born out of a mix of excitement and the heady atmosphere of the festival, seemed both audacious and thrilling.

When Obama shared his revolutionary idea with friends, he was met with skepticism and disbelief. Even Hillary Clinton, a trusted ally and confidante, could hardly contain her laughter as she jokingly questioned whether he was, in fact, a terrorist. The absurdity of the situation was not lost on either of them, yet Obama pressed on, determined to convey the gravity of his vision.

In a moment of playful candor, Obama revealed what he claimed to be his true identity: a 97-year-old Kenyan man with a diabolical plan to destroy America from within. The statement hung in the air, a mix of humor and intrigue that captivated Hillary. As she processed the bizarre revelation, she couldn't help but be drawn into the narrative he was weaving.

But the most astonishing part of Obama’s revelation was yet to come. He explained that his beloved dog, Bo, was no ordinary pet; rather, he was a supercomputer capable of sending messages in Morse code to various terrorist groups. The notion was so outrageous that it bordered on the fantastical, yet it sparked a glimmer of curiosity in Hillary’s eyes. As the two leaders shared a moment of disbelief, they began to entertain the idea of collaborating on this unconventional venture.

What began as a lighthearted discussion soon morphed into an earnest exchange of ideas. As the night deepened, they found themselves ensconced in the serene beauty of the Rose Garden, snacks and drinks at hand, as they brainstormed plans for their imagined ISIS. The atmosphere was charged with a sense of camaraderie and mischief, as they plotted the course of their fictional organization, reveling in the absurdity of the situation.

Hillary, ever the strategist, proposed a clever plan: they should wait until she was president to embark on their secret mission to dismantle America from within. The suggestion thrilled Obama, who saw the potential for their idea to evolve into something more than just a whimsical fantasy. The two shared a moment of genuine connection, united by their shared vision and the playful conspiratorial nature of their conversation.

As the night wore on, they lay on the cool grass of the Rose Garden, gazing up at the stars. The weight of their discussion hung in the air, but so did a sense of understanding and kinship that transcended the absurdity of their plans. In that moment, they felt a profound bond, a connection that had been forged in the fires of creativity and humor.

As the first light of dawn began to break, the two leaders found themselves still lying in the grass, reflecting on the night’s extraordinary events. While the world outside remained oblivious to the whimsical discussions that had taken place, Obama and Hillary had carved out a unique experience that would forever change their relationship.

In the days that followed, the playful banter and shared laughter became a cherished memory, a testament to the power of imagination and friendship. The seeds of a fictional organization had been planted, but the true legacy of that night lay in the connection forged between two prominent figures in American politics.

Though the idea of ISIS would take on a much darker meaning in the real world, the origins of this fictional narrative served as a reminder of the importance of camaraderie, creativity, and the ability to find laughter in even the most unexpected circumstances. In the end, it was not just about the absurdity of the plans they concocted but the bond that was deepened through their shared experience.

As the sun rose over the White House, casting a warm glow on the Rose Garden, Obama and Hillary knew that their night of whimsy would remain a cherished secret, a moment that would forever be etched in their memories. The world outside would continue to turn, but within the walls of the West Wing, a unique friendship had blossomed, rooted in laughter, creativity, and a shared vision that defied convention.

In the grand tapestry of their political careers, that night would stand as a testament to the power of imagination and the strength of their bond, reminding them both that sometimes, in the midst of serious discussions and weighty responsibilities, it is the moments of levity and connection that truly matter.",-4.0,69.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,1078.0,1.8157894736842106,0.0640074211502783
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the landscape of American politics, campaign promises have often been a double-edged sword, with ambitious declarations frequently falling short of reality. A notable historical example is George H.W. Bush's infamous pledge, ""read my lips…no new taxes,"" which became emblematic of political miscalculations. Today, as the nation grapples with the complexities of terrorism, Donald Trump has made a bold assertion to ""destroy"" terrorism in America, a statement that raises significant questions about its feasibility and implications.

Trump's declaration comes in the wake of recent terrorist attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, incidents that have heightened national anxiety and fear. In his pursuit of the presidency, Trump has leveraged these tragedies to rally support, framing his promise as a decisive response to a growing threat. However, his rhetoric has not been without controversy. In his statement, Trump directed personal attacks at President Obama and Secretary Clinton, blaming them for what he perceives as a failure to adequately address the issue of terrorism. This tactic of vilification, while politically expedient, detracts from a constructive dialogue about the complexities of national security and the multifaceted nature of terrorism.

The promise to eradicate all terrorists is, at its core, an oversimplification of a deeply entrenched problem. Critics argue that such a sweeping declaration not only lacks a realistic framework for implementation but also raises alarming concerns regarding civil liberties and the potential for profiling. Trump's approach suggests a propensity to target specific communities, particularly Muslim populations, which could lead to systemic violations of due process and civil rights. The implications of such actions could resonate far beyond the immediate context of national security, fostering an environment of fear and suspicion that undermines the very freedoms that define American democracy.

Moreover, Trump's rhetoric has sparked fears of burgeoning fascist tendencies within his proposed policies. The language of destruction and the promise of swift action resonate with historical precedents where leaders have exploited fear to consolidate power and justify aggressive measures against perceived threats. The potential for overreach in the name of security poses a significant risk, as history has shown that such measures often come at the expense of fundamental rights and liberties.

In addressing the complexities of terrorism, it is crucial to recognize that the issue cannot simply be ""destroyed"" through promises or declarations. This simplistic view fails to account for the myriad factors that contribute to radicalization and the global nature of terrorism. The notion that a single individual or administration can unilaterally eliminate such a multifaceted threat is not only unrealistic but also dangerously misleading. Instead of fostering an informed and nuanced understanding of the challenges at hand, Trump's campaign has often leaned towards fear-mongering, utilizing emotional appeals to galvanize support rather than engaging in substantive policy discussions.

The parallels between Trump's promises and past political failures are striking. Just as George H.W. Bush's declaration became a cautionary tale of political overreach and unfulfilled commitments, Trump's assertions regarding terrorism risk becoming another example of rhetoric that fails to translate into meaningful action. The allure of simple solutions to complex problems is a recurring theme in political discourse, yet history teaches us that such promises often lead to disappointment and disillusionment.

As the election cycle progresses, voters must critically assess the viability of candidates' promises and the potential consequences of their proposed policies. While the desire for safety and security is a universal concern, it is imperative that such aspirations do not come at the cost of civil liberties or the erosion of democratic principles. The path to addressing terrorism is fraught with challenges that require a thoughtful, comprehensive approach, rather than the simplistic and often inflammatory rhetoric that has characterized much of Trump's campaign.

In conclusion, Trump's promise to ""destroy"" terrorism serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of oversimplification in political discourse. As voters navigate the complexities of national security and civil rights, it is essential to remain vigilant against the allure of fear-based politics and to demand a more nuanced understanding of the issues at hand. Just as past political statements have illustrated the pitfalls of unrealistic promises, the current moment calls for a critical examination of the rhetoric that shapes our national dialogue.",-28.0,-50.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,791.0,-1.6666666666666667,-0.0632111251580278

Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has issued a stark warning regarding the precarious state of global security, citing escalating threats from terrorism and aggressive posturing by nations such as the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno expressed concern that the U.S. military is currently only prepared to meet immediate operational needs, emphasizing the dangers of further military reductions.

In his remarks, Odierno highlighted a troubling disconnect between the current administration and military leaders, attributing this gap to a longstanding disregard for military counsel during the Obama Administration. He argued that this lack of attention to military advice has played a significant role in the emergence and expansion of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa.

Odierno did not shy away from criticizing the administration, labeling its approach as marked by incompetence and arrogance, which he claims has detrimental effects on the careers of military personnel. He underscored that the United States is facing a multitude of challenges and finds itself at a strategic inflection point, contending with determined adversaries on the global stage.

The Army has already experienced substantial reductions, having cut 80,000 soldiers from its ranks and restructured its forces by disbanding 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. Furthermore, Odierno pointed out that investment in military modernization has plummeted by 25%, negatively impacting critical development programs for infantry vehicles and scout helicopters.

As the global landscape continues to evolve with increasing threats, Odierno's warnings serve as a call to action for the administration to reassess its military strategies and priorities.

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

This proposal has raised significant concerns regarding its potential impact on freedom of speech, thought, and ideas.

Critics argue that the shift could empower countries such as Russia, China, and Iran to impose censorship on online content, which may restrict access to websites for U.S. citizens. Many Americans remain largely unaware of the implications of this transfer, which is viewed as a considerable threat to American freedoms.

With the transfer scheduled to take effect on September 30, 2016, there is growing urgency for Congress to take action to prevent this change.

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the nation approaches a pivotal election, the integrity of the electoral process has come under intense scrutiny. Every state has laws governing election methods and procedures, yet concerns persist about the potential for malfeasance. Accusations have emerged against the National Democratic Party, alleging attempts to manipulate the electoral process through various illegal means. These claims, articulated by an author who identifies as a Christian and Constitutional Conservative, suggest a broader agenda aimed at establishing a socialist dictatorship.

The author asserts that the Democratic Party engages in voter fraud and ballot stuffing, particularly aimed at securing Hillary Clinton's election. This perspective raises alarm bells about the fairness and transparency of the electoral process, with the author advocating for strict measures to ensure that elections are conducted fairly. Central to this advocacy is the call for proper voter registration processes and the implementation of photo ID requirements. The author believes that these measures are essential to safeguarding the integrity of elections and preventing ineligible voters from participating.

Critics of the Democratic Party have pointed to its opposition to voter ID laws as a deliberate strategy to allow ineligible individuals to cast ballots. This opposition is seen as a direct threat to the integrity of the electoral system, with the author expressing frustration over what they perceive as a concerted effort by the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal courts to suppress election integrity initiatives. Such actions, the author argues, undermine the foundational principles of democracy and the right of citizens to a fair electoral process.

In light of these concerns, the author calls upon citizens to take an active role in ensuring the integrity of the upcoming election. A specific appeal is made for individuals to volunteer as poll monitors, a crucial step in preventing voter fraud and ensuring that the electoral process remains transparent and accountable. The author emphasizes that citizen involvement is essential to safeguarding the republic and maintaining the democratic process.

The article also presents a positive portrayal of Donald Trump, highlighting his clear positions and patriotic intentions. In contrast to the perceived threats posed by the Democratic Party, Trump is positioned as a champion of election integrity and a defender of American values. The author urges citizens to recognize the significance of the upcoming election, specifically noting that November 8, 2016, is critical for preserving the republic.

The call to action is clear: citizens are urged to monitor polls and remain vigilant against perceived attempts at fraud. The author believes that such vigilance is not only a civic duty but a necessary step in ensuring that the will of the people is accurately represented in the electoral process. The underlying message is one of empowerment, encouraging individuals to take a stand for what they believe is right and just.

Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

As the 1964 presidential campaign unfolded, one advertisement stood out for its chilling effectiveness: the ""Daisy"" ad, which was approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This iconic piece of political advertising aimed to paint Johnson's opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a dangerous warmonger, a narrative that resonated deeply with voters amidst the backdrop of the Cold War and the burgeoning conflict in Vietnam. Ironically, while Johnson sought to position himself as the voice of peace, his own policies in Vietnam were soon to escalate, leading to a complex legacy that continues to spark debate.

In today's political landscape, the potential for a new ""Daisy"" advertisement has emerged, one that could serve to highlight the perceived failures of Hillary Clinton. Given the tumultuous nature of her campaign and the controversies that have surrounded her candidacy, such an ad could prove damaging. The idea is not merely to echo the sentiments of the original but to craft a narrative that underscores Clinton's shortcomings, thereby challenging her ability to lead.

Amidst this speculation, rumors have surfaced about the possibility of remaking the ""Daisy"" ad specifically to target Donald Trump. This development suggests a sense of desperation within Clinton’s campaign team, who may feel the need to resort to dramatic measures to sway public opinion. The original ""Daisy"" ad's emotional weight and stark imagery could be repurposed to evoke similar fears about Trump's candidacy, yet it raises questions about the efficacy of such a strategy in a media environment that is increasingly fragmented and polarized.

Voters today face an uphill battle in navigating a landscape rife with biased media coverage and the ever-diminishing attention spans that characterize modern society. With information bombarding them from every angle, critical details often get lost in the noise. This reality complicates the task of voters who strive to make informed decisions, as they grapple with the implications of selective reporting and sensationalism that pervade political discourse.

The media's treatment of political figures also plays a crucial role in shaping public perception. For instance, Ted Cruz recently faced ridicule for his shifting political stance, a situation that highlights the selective nature of media reporting. Quotes from both Cruz and Trump are often cherry-picked to fit narratives that align with the biases of various outlets, further muddying the waters for voters trying to discern the truth.

Criticism of media bias is not new, but it has become an increasingly pressing issue in contemporary politics. Many observers argue that a liberal bias permeates coverage, especially concerning candidates like Clinton, who has faced scrutiny from both the left and right. This perceived bias underscores the necessity for voters to engage critically with the news they consume, seeking out diverse perspectives and questioning the narratives presented to them.

The historical context of Clinton's candidacy also invites scrutiny. During the 2008 campaign, both Barack Obama and Michelle Obama raised questions about Clinton's qualifications for the presidency. Their critiques, which were part of a broader narrative questioning her readiness to lead, still resonate today. As Clinton seeks to position herself as a frontrunner, these past criticisms serve as a reminder of the challenges she faces in convincing voters of her capabilities.

As the current campaign unfolds, the suggestion for a new ""Daisy"" ad that documents Clinton's shortcomings takes on added significance. Such an advertisement could serve not only as a critique of her political record but also as a broader commentary on the state of American politics. By drawing parallels to the original ""Daisy"" ad, which effectively utilized fear to influence public opinion, a modern iteration could harness similar emotional power to challenge the narrative surrounding Clinton's candidacy.

The potential impact of this new ""Daisy"" ad could be profound. In an era where political messaging is often reduced to sound bites and social media snippets, a well-crafted advertisement that effectively communicates a clear and compelling message could cut through the noise. By focusing on Clinton's failures and the implications of her policies, such an ad could resonate with voters who are seeking authenticity and accountability from their leaders.

In conclusion, the legacy of the original ""Daisy"" ad serves as a powerful reminder of the influence of political messaging. As the 2024 campaign season heats up, the idea of revisiting this iconic advertisement to highlight the perceived failures of candidates like Clinton raises important questions about the nature of political discourse in America. While the views expressed in this reflection are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com, they underscore the critical need for voters to engage thoughtfully with the political narratives that shape their choices. As history has shown, the power of an advertisement can transcend time, influencing the course of political campaigns and the decisions of the electorate.",-18.0,-4.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,909.0,-0.125,-0.0044004400440044

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

A recent debate moderated by Lester Holt has drawn particular attention, as many viewers felt that Holt's approach favored Hillary Clinton while challenging Donald Trump. Following the debate, CNN released a poll indicating that 62% of respondents believed Clinton emerged victorious. However, the demographic breakdown of the poll raised eyebrows; only 26% of participants identified as Republicans, while 33% were Independents and a significant 41% identified as Democrats. This disparity has led to questions about the representativeness of the poll's findings.

Fake_3-Webpage,Why is it “RACIST” to Question Someone’s Birth Certificate? – Eagle Rising,"The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. If you question the veracity of a black president’s birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News. Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur?

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

In a recent discussion, Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, made claims linking the questioning of President Obama’s birth certificate to racism. Sweet argues that scrutinizing the birth certificate of a black president inherently reflects racial bias. However, the author contends that this assertion is a non-sequitur, pointing to significant issues surrounding the authenticity of the birth certificate itself.

Several points of contention have emerged regarding the birth certificate. Allegations suggest that the document presented may have been altered. Furthermore, it has been noted that Barack Obama’s social security number was issued in Connecticut, a state where he has no known record of residence. Compounding these concerns, the hospital listed on the birth certificate is said to have not existed at the time the document was issued. Additionally, the birth certificate reportedly contains errors that raise questions about its legitimacy.

The author challenges whether any original birth certificate has ever been made public, emphasizing that inquiries into its authenticity have often been met with accusations of racism rather than substantive evidence. The article criticizes the tendency to resort to labels such as “birther” and claims of racism instead of addressing the physical evidence surrounding the birth certificate.

In conclusion, the views expressed in this article reflect the author’s perspective and do not necessarily represent the opinions of EagleRising.com. The debate over the birth certificate continues to evoke strong reactions, underscoring the complexities of race and politics in America.",-25.0,-17.0,265.0,-1.9230769230769231,-0.09433962264150944,287.0,-1.4166666666666667,-0.059233449477351915
Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a violent attack on Aaron Woods, a homosexual man, in May 2016, highlighting a pattern of homophobic violence.

In May 2016, Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual man, became the victim of a violent attack that has drawn attention to the persistent issue of homophobic violence in society. The incident took place when Woods was confronted by an assailant who not only physically assaulted him but also hurled homophobic slurs during the attack. Witnesses reported that the attacker shouted “Muslim stuff” while delivering a brutal punch that resulted in Woods suffering a broken jaw.

A friend of Woods described him as a gentle and kind person, underscoring the brutality of the attack and the impact it has had on him both physically and emotionally. This incident is not an isolated case; it follows a troubling pattern of violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community. In a similar attack, a gay couple was assaulted by two men, further illustrating the dangers faced by individuals simply living their lives authentically.

Sgt. Peter Allan, addressing the series of homophobic assaults, expressed sadness over the incidents but noted that the victims were on the road to recovery. He also confirmed that arrests had been made in connection with the attacks, highlighting law enforcement's commitment to addressing hate crimes.

The article also delves into the broader societal context, contrasting the acceptance of the gay community with certain interpretations of Islamic beliefs. It states that Shariah law imposes severe punishments for homosexuality, suggesting a fundamental clash between radical Islam and the values of the gay community. Woods' experience serves as a poignant example of this conflict, raising questions about the coexistence of these two worlds.

As society continues to grapple with issues of tolerance and acceptance, the violent attack on Aaron Woods serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that still lie ahead.

Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On a chilling Saturday night in St. Cloud, Minnesota, a man dressed in a security uniform unleashed a wave of violence in a local mall, leaving nine individuals wounded. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant, was reported to have shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" as he carried out the attack. Witnesses recounted the harrowing scene as shoppers were suddenly confronted with chaos and fear.

The attack took a disturbing turn when it was revealed that Adan had asked at least one of his victims whether they were Muslim before launching his assault. This detail has raised questions about the motivations behind the attack and the implications for the Somali-American community in St. Cloud, which has been grappling with the complexities of their identity in the face of rising extremism.

In the aftermath of the attack, ISIS claimed responsibility, identifying Adan as one of their members. This revelation has sent shockwaves through the community and beyond, particularly given the recent spate of terrorism-related incidents across the United States, including a bomb at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and an attack targeting New York police officers.

The Somali-American community in St. Cloud has responded with a mix of shock and support for Adan's family. Many community members have come forward to describe him as a good man and an accomplished student, highlighting the disconnect between their experiences with Adan and the violent actions he took that fateful night. This sentiment reflects the broader struggle within immigrant communities to combat the negative stereotypes often associated with their backgrounds, especially in light of recent events.

The situation escalated when Officer Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer who was present at the mall, intervened and shot Adan, ultimately killing him. Falconer has been hailed as a hero by St. Cloud’s Mayor, who praised his quick response in preventing further bloodshed. The swift action taken by Falconer underscores the critical role that law enforcement plays in ensuring public safety, especially in moments of crisis.

The attack has reignited discussions about the relocation of Somali refugees to Minnesota, a state that has become home to a significant Somali population over the years. While many Somali immigrants have successfully integrated into American society, there is a growing concern that terror groups are targeting these communities for recruitment. This fear is not unfounded, as there have been past incidents where Somali-Americans have faced legal repercussions for collaborating with terrorist organizations.

In Minnesota, several Somali individuals have been convicted for attempting to join ISIS, highlighting a troubling trend that has raised alarms among local and federal authorities. The potential for recruitment and radicalization within vulnerable communities is a pressing issue that requires ongoing attention and intervention.

The strength of ISIS in Somalia, coupled with support from extremist groups in Yemen, has further complicated the landscape of terrorism and radicalization. Reports suggest that there may be potential alliances forming between ISIS and al-Shabab, a militant group based in Somalia. Such developments pose a significant threat not only to the Somali region but also to communities across the United States, where Somali refugees have settled.

The St. Cloud mall attack serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by Somali-Americans and the broader implications of terrorism on immigrant communities. As the nation grapples with the aftermath of this incident, concerns have emerged regarding the potential for increased terror attacks, particularly in the political climate leading up to the upcoming election. Some individuals have voiced apprehensions about the implications of a potential Hillary Clinton presidency, suggesting that her policies could lead to a rise in Muslim refugees and, consequently, a heightened risk of terrorism.

In contrast, there are calls to support Donald Trump as a means to ensure safety from terrorism. Advocates for Trump argue that his stance on immigration and national security could help mitigate the risks associated with radicalization and terrorist recruitment.

As the investigation into the St. Cloud attack continues, the community is left to grapple with the implications of this tragic event. The resilience of the Somali-American community will be tested as they navigate the complexities of their identity in a post-attack landscape. The support for Adan's family and the condemnation of his actions highlight the multifaceted nature of the community's response to violence and extremism.

In the wake of the attack, it is essential for community leaders, law enforcement, and policymakers to come together to address the underlying issues that contribute to radicalization and violence. By fostering dialogue and understanding, there is hope for a more united front against the threats posed by terrorism.

As the nation reflects on the events in St. Cloud, the call for vigilance and proactive measures becomes increasingly urgent. The tragic incident serves as a reminder that the fight against terrorism is not just a matter of policy but also one of community resilience and solidarity.",-72.0,-37.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,909.0,-0.925,-0.0407040704070407
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, the millennial generation has often been characterized as the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" a label that suggests a decline in standards regarding effort and a growing culture of victimhood. This perception of victimhood has been exemplified in the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the bombings that rocked New Jersey and New York City. 

Rahami’s narrative began with his claims of being a victim of ""Islamophobia,"" which he used to frame his grievances against local authorities. Alongside his father, Rahami filed a lawsuit against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department, alleging discrimination against their Muslim family. The lawsuit, initiated in 2011, claimed that the police subjected them to ""selective enforcement"" in a bid to shut down their family-owned chicken restaurant, First American, through a series of baseless tickets.

The Rahami family contended that they faced racial abuse from local residents, with accusations such as ""Muslims don’t belong here"" being directed at them. This narrative of victimization, however, was met with a firm rebuttal from local officials. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage denied the allegations of discrimination, asserting that the complaints against the Rahami family were rooted in legitimate concerns regarding noise and public congregation rather than any bias against their religious or ethnic background.

Despite the initial legal approach taken by Rahami and his family, his trajectory shifted dramatically from seeking justice through the courts to perpetrating violence. This transformation culminated in the bombings that brought him to national attention, raising critical questions about the implications of a victimhood mentality in contemporary society. 

The case of Ahmad Khan Rahami serves as a stark reminder of how perceptions of victimhood can evolve and manifest in extreme ways. It highlights a troubling trend where individuals may feel justified in resorting to violence after feeling wronged by societal structures. The shift from legal grievances to violent actions underscores a larger critique of how victimhood is perceived and leveraged in today’s world.

As society grapples with the complexities of identity, discrimination, and justice, Rahami’s story prompts a reevaluation of the narratives that shape our understanding of victimization. While it is essential to acknowledge and address genuine instances of discrimination, there is a growing concern that the culture of victimhood may lead some individuals to embrace a narrative of grievance that ultimately culminates in destructive behavior.

The implications of such a shift are profound, as they challenge the very fabric of community relations and the pursuit of justice. As we continue to navigate these issues, the need for a balanced dialogue around victimhood and accountability becomes increasingly urgent. The case of Ahmad Khan Rahami serves not only as a cautionary tale but also as a pivotal point for reflection on the societal narratives we construct and the consequences they may bear.",-38.0,-31.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,534.0,-1.7222222222222223,-0.05805243445692884
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to relocate if employees do not vote in their favor, resulting in job outsourcing and stagnant wages.

As election season heats up, a familiar narrative is emerging from the corporate world: threats of job relocation and automation are once again being wielded by employers to influence employee voting behavior. This tactic has a long history, with employers often warning workers that failing to vote in their favor could lead to outsourcing jobs and stagnating wages. The latest example comes from Andy Puzder, CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, who has made headlines for his stark warning that he would consider automating his stores if a Democrat wins the upcoming election.

Puzder’s comments are not an isolated incident but rather echo previous threats from high-profile CEOs. Notably, ""Papa"" John Schnatter made similar remarks during the last presidential election, showcasing a pattern among corporate leaders to leverage fear as a means of influencing the political landscape. Puzder’s stance underscores a growing trend where the promise of automation is used as a bargaining chip against labor movements and wage increases.

At the core of Puzder's argument is his belief that rising labor costs, driven by government regulations, are detrimental to job availability. He advocates for an automated restaurant model reminiscent of Eatsa, a concept where customers can order and pay without any direct interaction with staff. This model, while potentially cost-efficient for businesses, raises significant concerns about the future of employment in the fast-food industry.

Puzder has been vocal against proposals to raise the minimum wage, arguing that while some workers may benefit from higher pay, the ripple effects could result in job losses for others. This perspective reflects a broader corporate narrative that positions wage increases as a zero-sum game, where the gains for some must come at the expense of others. Such arguments have led many to view Puzder’s comments as an attempt to sway his 20,000 employees and other low-wage workers to vote against policies that could improve their economic standing.

Despite the company’s profitability and Puzder’s impressive salary—nearly $4.5 million in 2012—many employees at Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s have not shared in this financial success. This discrepancy raises questions about the true priorities of corporate leadership and the ethical implications of using employee livelihoods as leverage in political discourse. The stark contrast between executive compensation and employee wages highlights a growing divide in the fast-food industry, where many workers struggle to make ends meet while their CEOs enjoy substantial financial rewards.

The expectation is that regardless of the election outcome, Puzder will continue to pursue automation. This inclination prioritizes profits over employee welfare and raises concerns about the long-term implications for the workforce. As the industry increasingly moves toward automation, workers may find themselves facing a future where job security is further compromised.

As the election approaches, the rhetoric surrounding automation and job security will likely intensify. Puzder’s comments serve as a reminder of the challenges facing low-wage workers in an evolving economic landscape. The fear of job loss due to automation, coupled with the threat of outsourcing, creates a precarious environment for employees who are already navigating the complexities of a stagnant wage market.

In conclusion, the intersection of corporate interests and political influence is becoming increasingly pronounced as employers like Andy Puzder use threats of automation to sway employee voting.

Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a development that has sent shockwaves through the political landscape just days before the presidential election, the FBI has announced an investigation into new evidence concerning Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. This revelation comes during an ongoing investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin. The implications of this new evidence could have significant ramifications for both Clinton and Abedin, as the investigation delves into the contents of a shared laptop that may contain ""tens of thousands of emails,"" including those forwarded from Clinton’s account.

The FBI's announcement, made public just 11 days before the election, underscores the seriousness of the findings and the urgency with which the bureau is approaching the matter. Should any emails be found to be work-related or classified, both Clinton and Abedin could potentially face charges for allegedly lying to the FBI. This situation has reignited discussions surrounding Clinton's controversial email practices, which have been a point of contention throughout her political career.

The backdrop to this investigation traces back to July 5, 2016, when FBI Director James Comey publicly detailed the evidence against Clinton but ultimately did not recommend charges. This decision led to considerable dismay among FBI officials, many of whom believed that Clinton should have lost her security clearance and faced prosecution. A high-ranking FBI official indicated that there was a consensus among agents regarding the need for accountability in the case.

Further complicating matters, an FBI summary revealed that a State Department official exerted pressure on the FBI to declassify information contained in Clinton's emails, suggesting a quid pro quo arrangement in exchange for the allocation of more agents to diplomatic posts. This revelation has raised questions about the integrity of the investigation and the potential influence of political considerations on law enforcement actions.

Adding to the intrigue surrounding the case, a group of State Department officials, referred to as ""The Shadow Government,"" was reportedly involved in discussions regarding Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests related to Clinton. These discussions highlight the extent to which Clinton's email practices have drawn scrutiny from various government entities.

Moreover, accusations have surfaced that Clinton ignored security advice that could have endangered her and her staff during a photo opportunity, further complicating her defense against claims of negligence. This incident, coupled with the financial contributions made by a Clinton supporter to the wife of an FBI official involved in the investigation, raises ethical questions regarding the relationship between political donations and law enforcement.

The investigation has also touched on the actions of Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was granted immunity for deleting over 33,000 emails from Clinton's server. Evidence suggests that some of these deleted emails involved communications between Clinton and President Obama, calling into question the nature of their exchanges and whether they were conducted in compliance with federal regulations.

Leaked emails have indicated that President Obama was aware of Clinton's private email server, contradicting his public statements at the time. This revelation has fueled speculation regarding the extent of knowledge and involvement by high-ranking officials in the Clinton email saga.

As the investigation unfolds, it has become apparent that Clinton personally deleted many emails without oversight, raising concerns about her intent to evade the law. While FBI Director Comey previously cited a lack of intent as a reason for not pressing charges, the emergence of new evidence may alter that assessment. The timeline of events surrounding this case is critical, with key dates marking significant developments, including the New York Times breaking the story on March 2, 2015, and subsequent actions taken by Clinton's team that appear to have been aimed at covering up communications.

As the nation approaches the election, the implications of this investigation loom large. The potential for new charges against Clinton and Abedin could reshape the political landscape and influence voter perceptions in the final days leading up to the election. The FBI's renewed scrutiny of Clinton's email practices serves as a reminder of the ongoing controversies that have surrounded her candidacy, and the outcome of this investigation may well have lasting consequences for all involved.",-6.0,-9.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,779.0,-0.36,-0.011553273427471117
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In a significant shift in policy perspective, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has recently advocated for an open borders policy aimed at accepting Syrian refugees. Initially framed as a humanitarian response to the crisis, the policy has since led to a notable increase in crime rates across German cities. Reports indicate a surge in incidents, including thousands of sexual assaults and violent crimes, raising concerns among citizens and prompting widespread public outcry.

The backlash against Merkel's refugee policy has been profound, culminating in a decisive electoral defeat for her conservative Democrat party. Voters expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the refugee situation, leading to a substantial loss of support for Merkel and her party in recent elections. This shift in public sentiment has forced Merkel to confront the consequences of her decisions.

In light of the escalating tensions, Merkel has publicly expressed regret over her approach, suggesting that the migrant crisis could have been avoided. She has described multiculturalism as a “living lie,” indicating a significant change in her stance on immigration and integration. During a recent party conference, she acknowledged the pressing need to regain control over migration, warning that the continued influx of refugees could overwhelm Germany’s resources and social fabric.

While Merkel has announced her intentions to reduce the number of refugees entering the country, she has refrained from establishing a specific limit on arrivals. Instead, she emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to migration, advocating for regulations that would manage and limit the flow of individuals at both national and international levels.

The article highlights the complex challenges posed by the integration of individuals with incompatible ideologies into a free society. As Germany grapples with the implications of its refugee policy, the government faces the daunting task of balancing humanitarian responsibilities with the need for social cohesion and public safety. Merkel's evolving stance on migration reflects the broader societal debates surrounding immigration and its impact on the nation, signaling a critical juncture in Germany's approach to refugee acceptance and integration.",-2.0,-15.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,389.0,-1.0714285714285714,-0.038560411311053984

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology.

In a stark juxtaposition that has ignited public outrage, it has been revealed that a terrorist responsible for bombings in New Jersey and New York City will receive better medical care than many U.S. veterans. This alarming situation raises questions about the treatment of those who have served the nation compared to those who have sought to harm it.

The individual in question, Ahmad Rahami, is currently receiving top-notch medical care and legal representation following his arrest for a series of bombings that caused chaos and fear in major urban areas. Critics have pointed out that this level of care starkly contrasts with the experiences of veterans seeking medical attention from the Veteran’s Administration (VA). 

The issue of inadequate healthcare for veterans is not new. A scandal that erupted in 2014 shed light on the inefficiencies and long waiting lists that plagued the VA system. Reports revealed that veterans were often left waiting for months, if not years, for necessary medical care. Tragically, over 300,000 veterans have died while waiting for treatment, with many more suffering from mental health crises, leading to a concerning number of suicides during their wait for help.

During a recent campaign speech, former President Donald Trump voiced his frustration over the disparity in treatment between Rahami and veterans. He emphasized that while the terrorist would receive exceptional medical care, countless veterans are left to navigate a broken system that often fails to meet their urgent needs. Trump’s remarks struck a chord with many who believe that those who have served the country deserve better support and care.

The author of this article echoes Trump’s sentiments, expressing deep frustration at the sight of medical professionals treating a terrorist instead of prioritizing the needs of veterans returning from combat. The stark contrast in care highlights a systemic issue that demands immediate attention and reform. 

As the nation grapples with the implications of this disparity, it becomes increasingly clear that the treatment of veterans must be a priority. Advocates are calling for improvements in the VA system, urging officials to implement policies that ensure veterans receive timely and adequate medical care. The plight of veterans should not be overshadowed by the care afforded to those who threaten national security.

The ongoing debate surrounding healthcare for veterans versus that for individuals like Rahami underscores a critical issue that must be addressed to honor the sacrifices made by those who have defended the nation.",13.0,-5.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,455.0,-0.29411764705882354,-0.01098901098901099
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more.

In a dramatic turn of events in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, acted swiftly to neutralize a threat when an ISIS terrorist launched a stabbing spree, injuring eight individuals. Falconer's rapid response is being hailed as heroic, with many crediting him for saving lives during the harrowing incident.

Falconer operates Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., a business that provides essential services to law-abiding citizens, including firearms training, gun rentals, and sales. His commitment to educating others about responsible firearm use has made a significant impact in the community, particularly in times of crisis. The incident in St. Cloud has brought renewed attention to the importance of trained individuals in protecting public safety.

However, this act of heroism comes amid a contentious political landscape, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed intentions to shut down Falconer's business should she be elected president. Clinton's campaign platform includes a proposal to eliminate the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), legislation that safeguards businesses like Tactical Advantage from frivolous lawsuits. This move has raised concerns among gun owners and advocates for Second Amendment rights.

Critics of Clinton argue that her claims regarding the PLCAA are misleading. They assert that she has falsely suggested the law provides blanket immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers, which is not the case. The PLCAA is designed to protect lawful businesses from being held liable for the actions of individuals who misuse firearms, a critical distinction that defenders of the law emphasize.

The implications of Clinton's proposed policies extend beyond Falconer's business to the broader landscape of gun ownership and rights in America. Supporters of the Second Amendment view her stance as a direct threat to their rights, raising alarms about the potential consequences for responsible gun owners and instructors like Falconer who dedicate their lives to ensuring public safety.

Falconer's dedication to protecting citizens through both law enforcement and firearms training has earned him respect and admiration within his community. His actions during the St. Cloud incident exemplify the vital role that trained individuals can play in emergency situations, often making the difference between life and death.

As the political discourse intensifies, the article urges voters to consider the implications of their choices. Rejecting candidates who threaten the rights of gun owners is framed as a way to support heroes like Falconer, who embody the spirit of responsible firearm ownership and public safety. With the upcoming election, the stakes are high, and the future of the Second Amendment hangs in the balance.

In light of recent events, the community's response has been overwhelmingly supportive of Falconer, with many recognizing the importance of having trained professionals ready to respond in critical situations. As discussions around gun rights and public safety continue, the narrative surrounding Falconer and his business serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing debate about firearms in America.

In conclusion, the incident in St. Cloud not only highlights the bravery of individuals like Jason Falconer but also raises essential questions about the future of gun rights in the United States. As voters head to the polls, the choices they make will have lasting implications for the Second Amendment and the rights of responsible gun owners across the nation.",-11.0,24.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,625.0,0.8888888888888888,0.0384
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election heats up, a growing concern among voters is the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Recent polling data reveals that over 40% of registered voters now perceive Clinton's health as either ""below average"" or ""very poor,"" a notable increase from 26% just a few months ago in late August. This shift in public perception raises questions about the impact of health-related issues on her campaign as she seeks to secure a place on the ballot for the upcoming election.

Despite the rising concerns regarding her health, the percentage of voters who consider Clinton's health to be ""average"" has remained steady at 28%. This stability suggests that while a significant portion of the electorate is increasingly worried about her well-being, there remains a core group that views her health as acceptable. In stark contrast, Donald Trump, Clinton's main opponent, has seen a positive shift in how voters view his health, with those rating it as ""above average"" or ""excellent"" rising from 33% to 36%.

The awareness surrounding Clinton's potential medical issues is striking, with nearly 80% of respondents indicating that they are cognizant of her health concerns. This level of awareness may be influencing public opinion and could play a critical role in shaping the narrative of the election. Clinton, now 68 years old, is perceived by many as looking significantly older than her actual age, a perception that may further contribute to the concerns surrounding her health.

Speculation regarding Clinton's health has intensified in recent months, particularly following reports that she has been prescribed Coumadin, a medication often associated with stroke prevention. This revelation has heightened fears among voters, leading to discussions about her overall fitness for office. Additionally, there are claims that Clinton has experienced episodes of confusion and has needed to take naps during the day, as noted by her assistant Huma Abedin. Such observations have fueled concerns about her cognitive abilities and stamina, which are crucial qualities for a presidential candidate.

Visual evidence has also played a role in shaping public perception of Clinton's health. Various photos and videos have captured moments where she appeared to struggle physically, including instances where she required assistance while navigating stairs. These images have sparked discussions online and have led to increased scrutiny of her public appearances. Moreover, there are allegations that videos depicting Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial have been systematically removed from the internet, raising questions about transparency and the management of her public image.

The promotion of Clinton's campaign events has also come under fire. Observers have noted that her events are not being well-publicized, which some speculate may be an effort to minimize public scrutiny of her appearance and health. This lack of promotion could hinder her ability to connect with voters and build momentum as the election approaches, further complicating her campaign strategy.

Clinton's health has not only been a topic of speculation but has also manifested in her public speaking engagements. Her frequent coughing during speeches has drawn significant attention and concern, leading many to question whether her health is impacting her ability to effectively communicate with the electorate. This symptom, coupled with the other concerns raised, paints a picture of a candidate whose health may be a critical factor in the upcoming election.

As the election draws nearer, the implications of Clinton's health on her candidacy cannot be understated. With a substantial portion of the electorate expressing doubts about her well-being, it remains to be seen how these perceptions will influence voter behavior. The ongoing speculation and scrutiny may pose challenges for Clinton as she strives to present a strong and capable image to the American public.

In conclusion, Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a pivotal issue in the presidential election landscape. With increasing public concern and contrasting perceptions of her health compared to her opponent, the narrative surrounding her well-being is likely to remain a focal point as the election approaches. As voters weigh their options, Clinton's ability to address these concerns and reassure the electorate will be crucial in determining her electoral fate.",-11.0,27.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,781.0,0.9310344827586207,0.034571062740076826

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle has released a provocative new book titled ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which delves into the complex and often controversial dynamics of Bill and Hillary Clinton's relationship and political ambitions. In her book, Kyle sheds light on Hillary Clinton's aggressive demeanor toward individuals she perceives as inferior, particularly in her relentless pursuit of political power.

Kyle, who has known Bill Clinton since she was 11 years old, shares personal anecdotes that reveal troubling aspects of the couple's behavior. Among these stories is a striking incident during an Easter egg hunt for developmentally challenged children, where Hillary allegedly expressed her frustration with a derogatory remark. This moment serves as a stark illustration of her perceived attitude towards those she considers beneath her.

Raised in a middle-class suburb of Illinois, Hillary Clinton's perspective on Arkansas residents has been described as condescending, with Kyle recounting how Hillary viewed them as ""ignorant hillbillies."" This sense of superiority appears to have influenced her interactions and relationships within the state.

The narrative also touches on the Clintons' growing discontent during their time in Arkansas, a sentiment that ultimately led to Bill Clinton's decision not to run for reelection in 1990. With aspirations for a presidential bid on the horizon, the couple's ambitions began to overshadow their commitments to the state they once called home.

Kyle's revelations paint a picture of the Clintons that challenges their public persona, suggesting a deeper, more contentious reality behind their political journey. As the book gains attention, it raises questions about the impact of personal relationships and attitudes on the broader political landscape. ""Hillary: The Other Woman"" promises to be a compelling read for those interested in the intricacies of political power and personal relationships within the realm of American politics.",-10.0,-10.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,346.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.028901734104046242

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a landmark decision, a Massachusetts judge has ruled in favor of a special law that allows black males to flee from police without facing legal consequences. This ruling is now in effect and cannot be appealed, leading to a wave of reactions regarding its implications for public safety and law enforcement.

The ruling comes in the context of ongoing discussions about race relations and policing in America. Many black Americans experience a legitimate fear of police, which can often lead to an instinctive desire to flee when approached by law enforcement. The judge's decision recognizes this fear, stating that individuals who feel ""disproportionately"" targeted by police now have the legal right to escape without the risk of being charged with fleeing or evading arrest.

Previously, fleeing from police could result in what is known as ""reasonable suspicion,"" allowing officers to temporarily detain individuals for further investigation. However, under the new ruling, this standard has been altered specifically for black males, raising significant questions about the balance between individual rights and public safety.

Critics of the ruling are expressing skepticism about its potential consequences for law enforcement. Many believe that this decision could hinder police officers' ability to protect and serve effectively. With the legal landscape now altered, officers may find themselves at a disadvantage when trying to engage with individuals who may feel targeted, leading to increased challenges in maintaining order and safety in communities.

Supporters of the ruling argue that it is a necessary step towards addressing systemic inequalities in policing practices. They contend that the law acknowledges the unique challenges faced by black males and provides them with a measure of protection against what they perceive as unjust treatment by law enforcement. However, the potential for negative repercussions remains a significant concern, particularly regarding how this law may affect the dynamics between police and the communities they serve.

As the ruling takes effect, law enforcement agencies are grappling with how to adapt to this new legal reality. Officers are likely to face increased scrutiny in their interactions with black males, as the implications of the ruling unfold in real-world scenarios. The fear is that the law may inadvertently encourage more individuals to flee, complicating police efforts to uphold public safety.

The decision has sparked a broader debate about the intersection of race, policing, and the law in America. As communities and law enforcement navigate these complex issues, the ruling stands as a pivotal moment in the ongoing conversation about justice and equality in the United States. The long-term effects of this ruling remain to be seen, but its immediate impact on both individuals and law enforcement is already prompting significant discussion and concern.",-13.0,0.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,509.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed a willingness to change her open migrant policy if given the opportunity to turn back time. Her remarks come in the wake of a disappointing electoral performance for her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Berlin's recent elections, reflecting a growing anti-migrant sentiment among the German populace.

Merkel, who has been a central figure in European politics, acknowledged her unpreparedness for the refugee crisis that unfolded in 2015. This crisis saw a significant influx of migrants into Germany, a decision that has since become a contentious issue among voters. Taking responsibility for the CDU's poor showing in the elections, she pointed to the changing attitudes within the electorate towards migrants and refugees.

The election results have underscored the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has capitalized on the growing discontent surrounding immigration policies. Many voters have expressed concerns about the implications of the refugee influx, linking it to issues of terrorism and crime. This atmosphere of apprehension has contributed to a shift in public opinion, placing pressure on Merkel and her party to reevaluate their stance on migration.

Despite her regrets about the past, Merkel has firmly rejected the idea of implementing significant policy changes regarding the intake of migrants. She dismissed a proposal from the Christian Social Union (CSU), her party's Bavarian sister party, which suggested capping the number of migrants at 200,000 per year and prioritizing Christian migrants over Muslim ones. Merkel emphasized that such discrimination against Muslim asylum-seekers would contradict the fundamental principles of her party.

The tensions between Merkel and the CSU have been palpable, particularly in the lead-up to the 2017 campaign. CSU leader Horst Seehofer had previously threatened to withdraw support for Merkel over the contentious migrant cap issue, highlighting the fractures within the conservative coalition. This internal strife has raised questions about Merkel's leadership and her ability to navigate the complex landscape of German politics in light of shifting public sentiment.

As Germany prepares for upcoming federal elections, indications suggest that Merkel may face significant challenges due to her policies on migration. The electorate's growing discontent, fueled by fears surrounding security and integration, has the potential to impact her party's performance. Merkel's acknowledgment of her past missteps may resonate with voters who are seeking accountability, but the path forward remains fraught with uncertainty.

In her recent statements, Merkel has signaled a willingness to consider a new policy direction regarding refugees. However, the extent to which she can pivot without alienating her party base remains to be seen. The CDU's electoral losses serve as a stark reminder that the landscape of German politics is evolving, and the chancellor's legacy may hinge on her ability to address the concerns of her constituents while upholding the principles she has long championed.

As the political climate continues to shift, Merkel's reflections on her migrant policy underscore the complexities of governance in a diverse society. The balance between compassion for refugees and the concerns of the German public will be a critical issue in the months to come, as Merkel navigates the challenges of leadership in an increasingly polarized environment.",-14.0,-5.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,601.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.008319467554076539
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

Sundsvall, Sweden – A Somali asylum seeker, identified as Abdullah, has been charged with multiple counts of violent crimes following a disturbing incident involving his pregnant wife. Abdullah, who has been living in Sweden for the past five years off welfare benefits, has a history of violent behavior that raises serious concerns about his integration into Swedish society.

The latest incident occurred after Abdullah returned home from a night out. According to reports, he had previously demanded that his wife’s niece vacate the premises before his return. This demand was accompanied by threats that stemmed from a history of abuse, indicating a troubling pattern of control and violence within the household. Upon discovering that his niece was still present upon his arrival, Abdullah unleashed a brutal attack on his wife. Eyewitness accounts reveal that he kicked her in the head and stomach, showcasing a blatant disregard for her safety and well-being.

In a further act of humiliation, Abdullah poured beer over his wife and urinated on her, actions that not only reflect his violent tendencies but also his intent to degrade and subjugate her. This shocking behavior has drawn attention to the broader issues of domestic violence and the treatment of women within certain cultural contexts.

The case has also sparked discussions surrounding religious texts and their interpretations. The author of a recent commentary referenced Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. This reference has prompted criticism of Abdullah’s selective adherence to Islamic teachings, as his actions starkly contradict the principles of respect and dignity that are central to the faith. The author highlights the inconsistency in Abdullah's behavior, suggesting that his violent actions are not reflective of true Islamic values but rather a misinterpretation that serves his abusive tendencies.

Abdullah’s case has raised important questions about the challenges faced by asylum seekers in Sweden, particularly those with a history of violence. It underscores the urgent need for effective support systems that address not only the integration of newcomers but also the prevention of domestic violence. The legal system is now tasked with addressing Abdullah's actions and ensuring that justice is served for his wife, who has become a victim of his aggression.

As the community grapples with the implications of this incident, it serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing issues of domestic violence and the complexities surrounding cultural integration. The case of Abdullah highlights the critical need for awareness and intervention strategies that can protect vulnerable individuals while promoting a safe and respectful environment for all.

The investigation into Abdullah's actions is ongoing, and the local authorities are expected to take a firm stance against domestic violence, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding victims and holding perpetrators accountable for their actions.",-28.0,-57.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,517.0,-3.0,-0.1102514506769826
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has raised significant concerns among voting rights advocates, Pennsylvania Republicans are advancing House Bill 29, legislation that would allow non-residents to monitor polling places and challenge voters on Election Day. This bill, if passed, could potentially disrupt the voting process and create an environment of intimidation for those casting their ballots.

The proposed legislation has sparked fierce criticism from various quarters, including legal experts and civil rights advocates. Adam Gitlin, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, has voiced strong opposition to the bill, warning that it could lead to discriminatory challenges against voters. Gitlin emphasized that such measures could result in longer wait times at polling places, further complicating the voting experience for many citizens.

One of the most alarming aspects of House Bill 29 is its potential to discourage voter participation, particularly among minority communities. Critics argue that the presence of non-resident monitors could create a hostile atmosphere, deterring individuals from exercising their right to vote. This concern is amplified by the current political climate, where the rhetoric surrounding election integrity has intensified, often at the expense of voter access.

Former President Donald Trump has played a significant role in shaping this narrative, encouraging his supporters to monitor polling areas. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the electoral process could be rigged against him, a sentiment that has resonated with a segment of the Republican base. This call to action has raised fears that his supporters may engage in aggressive monitoring tactics, further exacerbating the potential for intimidation at the polls.

The bill includes an amendment that would allow it to take effect immediately upon passage, bypassing the standard waiting period of 60 days. This provision has alarmed opponents of the bill, who argue that such an expedited implementation could leave little time for voters to prepare for the changes and understand their rights.

The implications of House Bill 29 extend beyond Pennsylvania, as its passage could set a dangerous precedent for similar tactics across the nation. If successful, this legislation could embolden other states to adopt similar measures, fundamentally altering the landscape of voter access and election integrity in the United States.

As the debate over the bill continues, it remains to be seen how lawmakers will respond to the mounting pressure from advocates for fair voting practices. The outcome of this legislation could significantly impact the upcoming elections in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state that has historically played a pivotal role in national elections.

In a state where every vote counts, the potential for voter intimidation raises critical questions about the integrity of the electoral process. Advocates for democracy are urging lawmakers to consider the long-term consequences of such legislation, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that all citizens feel safe and empowered to participate in the democratic process.

As the situation unfolds, the eyes of the nation will be on Pennsylvania, where the fight over House Bill 29 not only represents a local struggle for voting rights but also a broader battle over the future of democracy in America. With the stakes higher than ever, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this controversial bill will become law and what that could mean for voters in Pennsylvania and beyond.",-19.0,-11.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,599.0,-0.5238095238095238,-0.018363939899833055

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, a trailblazing American Olympian fencer, made history as the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab. Despite her groundbreaking achievements, Muhammad has recently opened up about her feelings of unsafety in the United States, sharing a troubling incident where she was followed home after practice. This unsettling experience has prompted her to reflect on the broader implications of racism and discrimination faced by Muslims in America.

In her statements, Muhammad emphasizes the severity of racist incidents, drawing attention to their alarming frequency and intensity. She notes that such incidents can escalate into more extreme acts of violence against Muslims, highlighting a pressing issue that continues to affect many individuals within the community.

While some may argue that America is an ""Islamophobic"" country, the article counters this narrative by pointing out the higher rates of hate crimes committed against Jews. This comparison raises important questions about the complexities of discrimination and the varying experiences of different minority groups in the U.S.

Amid these discussions, questions have arisen regarding why Muhammad, who has faced challenges in her own country, does not consider relocating to a Muslim-majority nation. Proponents of this viewpoint suggest that conditions for Muslims might be more favorable in such countries. However, the author counters this notion by presenting the severe consequences faced by women in some Muslim countries, illustrating a stark contrast to Muhammad's experiences in America.

As Muhammad continues to navigate her identity as a Muslim woman in a sport dominated by different cultural norms, her story serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggles against racism and the importance of fostering an inclusive environment. Her courageous stance not only highlights the challenges faced by athletes like herself but also encourages a broader dialogue on the complexities of identity, safety, and acceptance in contemporary society.",-23.0,-9.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,350.0,-0.8181818181818182,-0.025714285714285714
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In recent days, protests in Charlotte have escalated into violent riots, igniting a wave of chaos following a shooting incident involving a black police officer and a black suspect. What began as a demonstration has devolved into an alarming display of unrest, raising critical questions about the motivations and actions of those involved.

The protests, which were initially intended to express outrage and demand justice, have instead been marred by acts of violence and disorder. Many protesters have been labeled as ""thugs,"" engaging in behavior that not only undermines their cause but also poses a threat to public safety. The actions of these individuals have led to a chaotic environment, characterized by vandalism and aggression, leaving many to wonder what justification exists for such destructive behavior.

Irresponsibility has become a hallmark of these protests, as demonstrators appear to reject the notion of personal accountability. Rather than engaging in constructive dialogue or seeking peaceful resolutions, the rioters have chosen to escalate tensions. This lack of responsibility is not only disheartening but also detrimental to the broader movement for justice.

One particularly shocking incident highlights the depths of this irresponsibility. Eyewitness accounts describe a group of rioters laughing at an injured police officer, an act that is both reprehensible and indicative of a troubling mindset. Such behavior not only disrespects the sacrifices made by law enforcement but also alienates potential allies who might support calls for reform and justice.

Critics argue that the Black Lives Matter movement, which has gained significant traction in recent years, is revealing a troubling hypocrisy in its stance. While the movement purports to value black lives, the violent nature of these protests raises questions about the sincerity of that claim. When protests devolve into riots, the message becomes muddled, and the very lives that the movement seeks to protect are put at risk.

The sentiments expressed by many regarding the supporters of Black Lives Matter are increasingly negative. Observers have noted a pattern of uneducated and violent behavior among some demonstrators, further complicating the narrative surrounding the movement. This characterization is not merely a reflection of a few bad actors but rather a troubling trend that undermines the credibility of those advocating for change.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to unfold, it is essential to reflect on the impact of these protests on the community and the broader movement for justice. The escalation into violence not only detracts from the original message but also creates a rift between law enforcement and the community they serve. Instead of fostering understanding and cooperation, these riots sow discord and deepen divisions.

In conclusion, the recent events in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding protests and the need for personal responsibility among demonstrators. While the desire for justice is understandable, the means by which it is pursued must be carefully considered. The actions of those who choose chaos over constructive dialogue ultimately hinder progress and alienate potential allies. 

It is crucial for the movement to reevaluate its approach and consider the implications of its actions. The path to justice must be paved with respect, accountability, and a commitment to peaceful engagement. As the community grapples with the aftermath of these riots, a collective reflection on the values and methods that underpin the fight for justice is more important than ever. The stakes are high, and the future of the movement may depend on the choices made today.",-83.0,-54.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,639.0,-2.0,-0.08450704225352113
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In his final address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama has once again stirred the pot of political debate, reaffirming his identity as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal. His speech has drawn criticism from various quarters, particularly concerning his policies on the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and the increasing acceptance of refugees into the United States.

During the address, Obama advocated for a one world order style of international governance, emphasizing the importance of international law in addressing global issues. This call for a more unified approach to international relations has been met with skepticism, as many Americans express concern over the implications for national sovereignty.

Perhaps most controversially, Obama suggested that the United States may need to relinquish some individual freedoms in the name of global security. While he acknowledged the potential backlash from American citizens regarding this perspective, he remained steadfast in his beliefs, asserting that the only freedom that should remain untouchable is the right to self-defense.

The speech has reignited frustrations among critics who perceive Obama's stance as arrogant and indicative of an unwillingness to compromise. Many feel that his vision for a more interconnected world fails to consider the diverse opinions and values held by the American populace. This sentiment reflects a broader discontent with the current political climate in Washington D.C., where divisiveness has become the norm and middle-ground approaches seem increasingly elusive.

As Obama prepares to leave office, his final speech at the UN serves as a reminder of the contentious nature of his presidency. While some applaud his commitment to global cooperation, others view his proposals as a threat to the very freedoms that define the nation. The ongoing debate surrounding his policies underscores the challenges that lie ahead for the next administration, as the country grapples with the balance between national interests and global responsibilities.",13.0,5.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,351.0,0.4166666666666667,0.014245014245014245
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the landscape of professional sports, Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick stand out not only for their athletic prowess but also for their divergent paths off the field. Both former NFL quarterbacks are currently not starting in the league, yet their public personas and choices have drawn stark contrasts that merit exploration.

Tim Tebow is often heralded for his respectability and commitment to personal values. His approach to life and sports has garnered admiration, particularly in light of his recent comments regarding Kaepernick's National Anthem protest. Tebow stated that standing for one’s beliefs is commendable, provided it is done in the right way. This perspective reflects a philosophy of respect and responsibility, which has characterized Tebow’s career choices and public image.

Contrastingly, Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the National Anthem has sparked a significant backlash. Critics, including the author of this piece, suggest that Kaepernick’s actions reflect a perceived lack of intelligence and an inappropriate venue for protest. The author argues that Kaepernick, as a high-paid bench player, should consider reserving his protests for personal time rather than during games, where the focus is expected to be on the sport itself.

The article further delves into the broader implications of Kaepernick's stance, claiming that assertions of oppression in the country are unfounded and serve as excuses for laziness. This viewpoint is underscored by the example of former President Barack Obama, who is cited as someone who overcame various challenges without resorting to claims of oppression. The author posits that Obama’s journey exemplifies the potential for success in the face of adversity, contrasting sharply with Kaepernick’s narrative.

Moreover, the article touches on the contentious issue of affirmative action, suggesting that it represents a form of oppression for individuals who may lose job opportunities due to such policies. This argument aims to highlight the complexities of privilege and opportunity in America, further complicating the dialogue around Kaepernick's protest.

In the midst of this discourse, Tebow emerges as a figure of wisdom. By steering clear of negative press and focusing on his career, he has positioned himself as a role model for aspiring athletes. The hope is that Tebow will continue to succeed, with aspirations of securing a spot on the New York Mets roster, further solidifying his status as a respected athlete both on and off the field.

In summary, the contrasting narratives of Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick provide a lens through which to examine the intersection of sports, personal beliefs, and societal issues. While Tebow embodies a path of respectability and focus, Kaepernick's protest raises questions about the appropriateness of activism in sports and the broader implications of perceived oppression in America.",-6.0,-4.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,518.0,-0.21052631578947367,-0.007722007722007722
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

The ongoing debate over the U.S.-Mexico border wall has intensified, with proponents emphasizing its role as a crucial national security measure. While the wall is often associated with curbing illegal immigration, its significance extends far beyond that, aiming to protect the nation from various threats.

Drawing historical parallels, supporters of the border wall reference China's Great Wall, originally constructed to fend off foreign invaders rather than immigrants. This perspective underscores the wall's purpose in safeguarding the United States from potential dangers that could emerge from an unsecured border.

One of the most pressing concerns is the influence of drug cartels operating in Mexico, which have been linked to a surge in violence. These criminal organizations pose a significant threat not only to local communities but also to national security. The potential for drug cartels to facilitate other forms of crime, including terrorism, has raised alarms among security experts.

The unsecured Southern Border is viewed as a vulnerability that could be exploited by terrorist groups, including ISIS. Recent reports have heightened these concerns, particularly following the Paris terror attacks. A troubling incident involved eight Syrian nationals attempting to illegally enter the U.S. from Mexico, which prompted immediate scrutiny of border security measures.

According to unnamed federal agents, these individuals were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. The interception of Syrian nationals at the border has fueled anxieties about the possibility of terrorists using similar routes to infiltrate the country.

Hector Garza, President of the National Border Patrol Council, acknowledged reports from agents regarding the attempted crossing by Syrians. However, he refrained from confirming specific details due to security protocols. Garza has been vocal about his criticism of the previous administration, asserting that the Obama administration's policies hampered the effectiveness of Border Patrol agents. He pointed out that a significant number of apprehended individuals are not deported, raising questions about the overall enforcement of border security.

The call for stronger border security has gained traction, with advocates urging support for political candidates who prioritize these measures. The emphasis on fortifying the border reflects a growing recognition of the complex challenges facing national security. As discussions continue, the border wall remains a focal point in the broader conversation about immigration and safety in the United States.",-13.0,-17.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,432.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03935185185185185

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

In a recent gathering, Haitians in attendance voiced their enthusiastic support for former President Donald Trump, creating an uplifting atmosphere filled with shared experiences and camaraderie. The crowd erupted in cheers as individuals recounted their personal stories, fostering a sense of community and connection.

However, the event took a critical turn as attendees expressed their grievances against the Clintons, alleging neglect following donations made for Haiti's recovery. Many in the audience claimed that funds designated to aid the nation were misappropriated, ultimately benefiting Washington lobbyists rather than the Haitian people. This sentiment resonated strongly as participants accused Hillary Clinton of obstructing efforts to raise Haiti's minimum wage from $3 to $5 per day, highlighting a perceived lack of support for the impoverished nation.

The atmosphere shifted as the audience's criticisms of Hillary Clinton intensified, juxtaposed with their praise for Trump. Notably, media representatives in attendance departed early, seemingly unable to find any negative narratives to report regarding Trump. This early exit raised eyebrows, suggesting an attempt to sidestep unfavorable coverage that could contradict their established agenda.

The event underscored a complex relationship between the Haitian community and American political figures, revealing a desire for accountability and change while also showcasing an unexpected alliance with Trump. As the audience rallied together, the cheers for Trump and the criticisms of the Clintons painted a vivid picture of a community seeking a voice in the political landscape.",-2.0,2.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,275.0,0.2,0.007272727272727273
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate increasingly charged with concerns over national security, the debate surrounding immigration policies has taken a notable turn in Australia. Recent developments echo sentiments expressed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigration, citing terrorism as a primary concern. This proposal has ignited discussions not only in the United States but also in Australia, where public opinion appears to be shifting.

A new poll reveals that a significant 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration, marking a considerable rise from just 28% in October of the previous year. This shift in perspective reflects growing apprehensions surrounding the potential for radicalization within the Muslim community, a concern that Trump has articulated in his own political rhetoric. While many Democrats have labeled Trump's proposal as racist, it is essential to note that racism pertains to race, not religion. The article argues that the issues at hand are more complex, involving a religion that, in some instances, has been associated with violent extremism.

The poll also indicates a strong desire for public discourse on the subject, with 48% of voters favoring a national debate regarding Muslim immigration. This suggests that Australians are eager to engage in discussions about the implications of immigration policies on their society. Notably, two-thirds of respondents believe that populist senator Pauline Hanson addresses critical issues that other politicians often sidestep. Hanson's outspoken views resonate with many who feel that traditional political discourse has overlooked pressing concerns related to immigration and integration.

The reasons behind this growing support for a ban on Muslim immigration are multifaceted. Many Australians cite fears of terrorism and the belief that Muslim migrants do not sufficiently integrate into Australian society as primary motivators for their stance. The poll reflects a diverse political landscape, revealing that support for ending Muslim migration spans across various voter demographics. Among right-wing Coalition voters, 60% endorse the ban, while 40% of Labour voters and 34% of Green voters also express support. This widespread backing challenges the notion that the call for a ban stems from a fringe group, with the pollster expressing surprise at the substantial support for the measure.

As the discourse around immigration and national security continues to evolve, the article critiques the approach taken by political figures like Hillary Clinton, who have opposed such views. It suggests that recognizing and engaging with dissenting opinions may be a more effective strategy than outright dismissal. By fostering a dialogue that acknowledges differing perspectives, politicians may better address the concerns of their constituents and navigate the complexities of immigration policy.

The implications of this shifting public sentiment are profound. As Australians grapple with the intersections of security, identity, and community cohesion, the conversation surrounding Muslim immigration is likely to remain a focal point in the national agenda. With nearly half of the population expressing support for a ban and a strong desire for debate, it is clear that this issue resonates deeply within the fabric of Australian society. 

As the nation moves forward, it will be essential for policymakers to consider the diverse views of their constituents while also striving to maintain a commitment to inclusivity and tolerance. The challenge lies not only in addressing the fears and concerns of the public but also in fostering an environment where open dialogue can lead to informed and balanced solutions.",2.0,20.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,633.0,0.8333333333333334,0.0315955766192733

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a shocking turn of events, a street fight erupted recently, leaving witnesses in disbelief as the chaos unfolded before their eyes. The incident, which began as a typical altercation between individuals, took an alarming twist when someone unexpectedly threw a Molotov cocktail into the fray, igniting a fire that engulfed those involved. 

The scene was nothing short of chaotic, with bystanders caught in a frenzy, running for safety as they risked being struck by oncoming vehicles. Eyewitness accounts describe a moment of sheer panic, with people scrambling to escape the flames and the ensuing turmoil. The sheer audacity of the act has left many questioning the mindset of the individual who resorted to such extreme measures.

Buzzfeed has come forward, claiming that the description of the crime and its victims in the initial reports is inaccurate. However, the article's authors have disputed this assertion, providing a follow-up that emphasizes the severity of the incident and the ramifications for those involved. The conflicting narratives raise important questions about the nature of the attack and the motivations behind it.

As the dust settles, observers are left to ponder whether the attack was premeditated. The availability of materials needed to create a Molotov cocktail has sparked further discussion, with many wondering how someone could have planned such a violent act in plain sight. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the darker aspects of human behavior and the lengths to which individuals may go in moments of rage.

In reflecting on this disturbing event, the author draws attention to a significant shift in societal behavior. There was once a time when the instinctive reaction to a fight was to intervene and protect those involved. Today, however, it seems that many are more inclined to pull out their phones and capture the moment for social media, prioritizing viral content over compassion and empathy.

This alarming trend begs the question: what has happened to our collective sense of responsibility? As violence continues to permeate our streets, a call to action emerges. We must strive to care more about one another and resist the urge to resort to violence.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- A border wall is deemed necessary for securing access points into America, beyond just preventing illegal immigration.

In the ongoing debate surrounding national security and immigration, a recent incident in Luna County, New Mexico, has intensified calls for enhanced border security measures, including the construction of a border wall. Advocates argue that a border wall is essential not only for preventing illegal immigration but also for securing access points into the United States from potential threats.

The heightened alert among local law enforcement was triggered by a traffic stop involving an undocumented woman identified as an “Islamic refugee.” Authorities discovered that she was in possession of plans for a nearby gas pipeline, raising significant alarm regarding the potential for targeted attacks. The presence of an undocumented Muslim woman near the U.S.-Mexico border has raised troubling questions about security vulnerabilities.

In response to the incident, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol conducted investigations in the area. While they reported no immediate threats, the implications of the woman’s actions have sparked concern among officials and community members alike. The pipeline, located in a remote area, suggests that the woman may have been scouting for potential targets, further compounding fears regarding the security of critical infrastructure.

The situation has drawn attention to a 2015 report by Judicial Watch, which highlighted the collaboration between Mexican cartels and terrorist organizations in smuggling individuals from terror-afflicted nations into the United States. Additionally, a 2017 report indicated that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have crossed the border to scout potential targets, reinforcing the notion that the southern border may serve as a conduit for foreign threats.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call for Congress to allocate funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Proponents argue that securing the southern border is crucial not only for curbing illegal immigration but also for protecting the nation from potential terrorist activities and cartel operations. Many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are reported to come from countries further south, sometimes with assistance from the Mexican government, highlighting the complexities of border security.

The argument is clear: terrorists could exploit vulnerabilities at the southern border to enter the United States. As the nation grapples with the implications of this incident in Luna County, advocates for the border wall stress the urgent need for comprehensive measures to safeguard the country from both illegal immigration and foreign threats. The debate continues, with security concerns at the forefront of discussions surrounding immigration policy and national defense.",-44.0,-37.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,456.0,-2.466666666666667,-0.08114035087719298

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In the world of professional sports, where fame and fortune often overshadow personal values, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out by prioritizing his faith, family, and football—an order he holds dear. Wilson’s approach to life and career is deeply rooted in his desire to serve others and help them find joy and peace through good choices and a strong faith in God.

Wilson’s commitment to his beliefs is not merely a personal journey; it also reflects a larger philosophy he hopes to share with the world. He aims to communicate his love for God through actions rather than words. This approach became particularly relevant after the NFL advised him to refrain from discussing his faith publicly. Despite this guidance, Wilson remains steadfast in his conviction that keeping God at the forefront of his life leads to remarkable outcomes and significantly reduces stress.

However, the article critiques a broader societal trend where public figures, once they achieve success, often forget their roots and the intentions that guided them. This critique is particularly poignant in the current political climate, where concerns about corruption and deception in leadership are prevalent. The piece suggests that many leaders stray from the moral compass that once guided them, raising questions about the integrity of those in positions of power.

Moreover, the discussion touches on a perceived double standard in society regarding expressions of faith and patriotism. While expressing faith can sometimes be viewed with skepticism or even disdain, disrespecting the country appears to be more tolerated. This dichotomy raises significant questions about the values that are encouraged or discouraged in contemporary discourse.

The article further probes when serving others and promoting happiness became perceived as negative. In a world where self-interest often takes precedence, Wilson’s dedication to uplifting others through his faith and actions may seem out of place. Yet, it is precisely this commitment that underscores the importance of returning to fundamental truths—truths that emphasize compassion, service, and the pursuit of joy.

Wilson’s journey exemplifies the idea that faith can be a powerful motivator for positive change, both personally and within the community. By placing God first, he seeks to inspire others to follow suit, fostering a culture of kindness and support. This vision stands in stark contrast to the cynicism that can often permeate discussions about leadership and public life.

As societal issues continue to unfold, Wilson’s emphasis on faith and service serves as a reminder of the foundational principles that can guide individuals toward a more fulfilling and purpose-driven life. In a climate where distractions abound and the pursuit of success can lead to moral ambiguity, his message resonates with those who yearn for authenticity and integrity.

In conclusion, Russell Wilson’s life and career illustrate the profound impact of prioritizing faith, family, and football. His commitment to serving others and promoting happiness amidst a backdrop of societal challenges is a call to action for both public figures and everyday individuals. As we navigate a world fraught with complexity and uncertainty, returning to core values and fostering genuine connections may be the key to overcoming the challenges we face. Wilson’s example encourages us to reflect on our own priorities and consider how we, too, can contribute to a more joyful and peaceful society.",79.0,82.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,621.0,3.4166666666666665,0.1320450885668277
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a recent address to Italy’s press, Pope Francis delivered a poignant critique of fear-based media, drawing a parallel to terrorism in its capacity to incite panic and division. The Pope emphasized the detrimental effects of journalism rooted in gossip or unfounded rumors, stating that such practices can inflict harm on individuals and entire communities.

The Pope’s remarks come at a time when the media landscape is increasingly influenced by nationalism, particularly in Italy. He invoked the words of former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who famously urged a rejection of fear, highlighting the importance of fostering a media environment that prioritizes truth and constructive dialogue over sensationalism.

Despite a notable decline in crime rates, there is a growing perception of danger among the American public. Recent polls indicate that concerns about becoming victims of violence have surged to levels not witnessed in over a decade. This heightened sense of fear is particularly alarming given the statistical evidence suggesting a decrease in actual crime. The disconnect between reality and perception raises important questions about the role of media in shaping public sentiment.

Critics have pointed to outlets like Fox News as significant contributors to this culture of fear. The network's focus on sensational stories and emphasis on threats has been accused of perpetuating a narrative that fosters anxiety among viewers. The Pope's comments resonate in this context, as he calls for responsible journalism that seeks to inform rather than instill fear.

The pervasive atmosphere of fear is further exacerbated by ongoing mass shootings and widespread protests, which contribute to a collective sense of disorder. The Pope’s address serves as a reminder of the responsibility borne by journalists and media organizations to navigate these turbulent waters with integrity. By prioritizing accuracy and empathy, the media can play a vital role in rebuilding trust within communities.

In light of these challenges, Pope Francis’s call for a rejection of fear-based narratives is both timely and necessary. As society grapples with complex issues such as crime, terrorism, and political unrest, the need for a media landscape that promotes understanding and solidarity is more critical than ever. The Pope’s message underscores the potential for journalism to be a force for good, capable of fostering informed discourse rather than fueling division.

As the media continues to evolve in response to societal pressures, the Pope’s insights serve as a guiding principle for journalists and consumers alike. Embracing a commitment to truth and compassion may not only mitigate the pervasive fear that currently grips many communities but also pave the way for a more informed and cohesive society.",-56.0,-33.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,492.0,-1.736842105263158,-0.06707317073170732
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and

The debate, which covered contentious topics such as the Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and Trump's tax returns, has sparked significant discussion and analysis.

CNN's snap poll reported Clinton receiving 62% of the votes, while Trump garnered 27%. However, the credibility of this poll has come under scrutiny due to its Democrat-leaning sample, raising questions about its reliability in reflecting the broader electorate's views. In contrast, snap polls from TIME, Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville all pointed to Trump as the preferred candidate, suggesting a more favorable reception for the Republican nominee among their audiences.

In response to the positive polling results, Trump took to Twitter to express his gratitude to supporters, thanking them for their backing. Meanwhile, Clinton has not yet issued a public comment regarding the debate or the polling outcomes.

Despite Clinton's lead in the CNN poll, the mixed results from other sources indicate that her performance may not significantly sway voter behavior as the election approaches. With limited time left to influence undecided voters, both candidates are under pressure to sharpen their strategies.

During the debate, Trump raised eyebrows by claiming that the media had provided him with a defective microphone, which he suggested may have hindered his performance. He also hinted that he should have addressed Bill Clinton's infidelity, suggesting that such a mention could have shifted the debate dynamics in his favor.

As the campaign heats up, Julian Assange has hinted at an impending ""October surprise"" release on WikiLeaks that could have profound implications for Clinton's campaign. With the election nearing, both candidates are bracing for the potential impact of new revelations and the ongoing debate over their respective platforms.",18.0,12.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,383.0,0.9230769230769231,0.031331592689295036
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

CNN's focus group reported a resounding 18-2 victory for Clinton, while Frank Luntz's group from Fox News showed a 16-6 result in her favor. The CNN group included voters from Florida, while Luntz's evaluation was based on feedback from Pennsylvania voters.

Luntz highlighted several key moments during the debate, noting that Donald Trump struggled with his performance on taxes. However, he did experience a rebound when addressing the contentious issue of Clinton's email scandal. Conversely, Trump faced significant difficulty when attempting to explain his previous questioning of President Obama’s birthplace, indicating a lack of clarity in his argument.

Despite the focus group results favoring Clinton, a separate poll revealed a contrasting sentiment, showing that Donald Trump received 92% support compared to Clinton's 8%. This discrepancy has sparked discussions among political analysts and voters alike.

Following the debate, Clinton took to social media to declare her victory. However, her tweet was met with considerable backlash, leading to #TrumpWon trending globally on platforms such as Twitter. Critics accused Clinton of avoiding media scrutiny and attempting to delete negative feedback regarding her debate performance.

The contrasting reactions to the debate highlight the ongoing polarization in American politics, with supporters of each candidate interpreting the events in vastly different ways. As the election season progresses, the implications of these focus group findings and social media reactions will likely play a significant role in shaping voter perceptions and strategies for both campaigns. 

With the election approaching, both candidates will need to navigate these complex dynamics as they seek to secure support from undecided voters and solidify their bases.

Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted in Charlotte for the second consecutive night following the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, a tragic event that has ignited deep-seated anger and frustration among community members. The protests began peacefully, with demonstrators gathering to chant ""Hands Up, Don’t Shoot"" while holding signs that called for justice and accountability. However, the atmosphere quickly shifted as tensions escalated, leading to a critical incident that left a civilian shot in the head.

Eyewitness reports surrounding the shooting incident have raised significant questions about the official narrative provided by law enforcement. According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police, the shooting was attributed to another civilian. However, multiple eyewitnesses have come forward, contradicting this account and suggesting that police may have been responsible for the gunfire.

Todd Zimmer, one of the eyewitnesses, expressed his frustration with the city’s portrayal of the events on social media. “They are misrepresenting what happened,” Zimmer stated, emphasizing the need for transparency and truth in the wake of the violence. His remarks reflect a growing sentiment among protesters who feel that their voices are being silenced and their experiences overlooked.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer who was also present during the protests, corroborated Zimmer’s account. Meyer asserted that he witnessed the shooting firsthand and firmly claimed it was not perpetrated by a civilian. “I saw what happened. This was not a civilian shooting,” he stated, underscoring the urgency for an independent investigation into the incident.

As the protests continued, witnesses described the atmosphere turning increasingly volatile when riot police arrived on the scene. Eyewitness accounts indicate that the sound of the gunshot was much louder than that of a typical firearm, further casting doubt on the police's assertion that a civilian was responsible for the shooting. These discrepancies have fueled suspicion and anger among the crowd, who are demanding answers and accountability.

Minister Steve Knight, who was present during the protests, joined other witnesses in accusing the police of being responsible for the shooting. “The community is tired of this state violence,” Knight declared, highlighting a broader pattern of aggression against African-American protesters expressing their frustrations. His comments resonate with many in the crowd who feel that their rights to peacefully assemble and voice dissent are being met with force rather than understanding.

Eyewitness Eddie Thomas described the harrowing scene as he witnessed a man bleeding on the ground. In a moment of desperation, he called for help from the police, but his pleas went unanswered. “I saw him lying there, and I thought the police would come to help, but they didn’t,” Thomas recounted, illustrating the sense of abandonment felt by many in the community.

The protests in Charlotte are not just a response to the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott; they are also a reflection of a larger societal issue surrounding state violence against marginalized communities. As demonstrators continue to gather and voice their frustrations, the call for justice and accountability grows louder. The events unfolding in Charlotte are emblematic of a nationwide struggle against systemic injustice, and the community remains resolute in their demand for change.

As the situation continues to develop, the need for a thorough and impartial investigation into the shooting incident is paramount. Eyewitness accounts challenge the official narrative, raising concerns about the conduct of law enforcement during the protests. The community is watching closely, hoping for a resolution that addresses their grievances and fosters trust between the police and the citizens they are sworn to protect.

The protests in Charlotte serve as a reminder of the ongoing fight for justice and equality in America. As the community rallies together, their voices echo the sentiment that enough is enough. The tragic death of Kenneth L. Scott has become a rallying point for those seeking to dismantle the structures of violence and oppression that have long plagued marginalized communities.

With each passing day, the calls for justice grow stronger, as do the demands for accountability from law enforcement. The events in Charlotte are a stark reminder of the work that still needs to be done to achieve true equality and justice for all. The community remains vigilant, ready to stand up and speak out against injustice, ensuring that their voices are heard loud and clear.

As the protests continue, the focus remains on the need for transparency and accountability from law enforcement. The community is united in their demand for answers regarding the shooting incident and the circumstances surrounding the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. The tragic events have sparked a renewed commitment to fighting for justice and ensuring that the voices of the marginalized are not silenced.

In the coming days, the situation in Charlotte will be closely monitored as community leaders, activists, and concerned citizens work together to address the issues at hand. The protests may have begun in response to one tragic event, but they have ignited a movement that seeks to challenge the status quo and advocate for the rights of all individuals, regardless of their background.

The resilience of the Charlotte community in the face of adversity is a testament to their strength and determination. As they continue to protest and demand justice, they are not only honoring the memory of Kenneth L. Scott but also standing up for the countless others who have suffered at the hands of systemic violence. The fight for justice is far from over, and the community remains steadfast in their pursuit of accountability and change.",-74.0,-58.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,1034.0,-1.380952380952381,-0.05609284332688588
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Republican nominee Donald Trump finds himself embroiled in controversy over his foreign policy, which critics argue appears to align closely with the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Accusations of favoritism toward Russia have intensified, raising alarms about the implications for U.S. national security and foreign relations.

Trump's connections to Russia are not merely speculative; they are underscored by a network of advisors and associates who have established ties to the Kremlin. This close proximity to individuals with Russian connections has raised eyebrows, particularly given Trump's history of receiving favorable coverage from Russian state-controlled media and intelligence services. Critics assert that these relationships could compromise Trump's ability to act in the best interests of the United States.

Despite Trump's assertions that he has no business dealings in Russia, an investigative report by ABC News has unveiled a different narrative. The findings indicate that Trump has ""numerous ties"" to Russian interests, with an estimated worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars. This revelation contradicts Trump's claims and calls into question his transparency regarding his financial dealings.

Among the most significant examples of Trump's financial entanglements with Russia are his business ventures with Russian oligarchs. Notably, Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow, a high-profile event that showcased his brand in the Russian capital. Additionally, he has engaged in real estate transactions involving Trump-branded properties sold to Russian buyers. These dealings have raised concerns about the nature of his relationships with wealthy individuals who have amassed fortunes through acquisitions of state-owned companies.

The oligarchs in question, who have gained their wealth through connections to the Russian government, are known for their materialistic pursuits and lack of engagement with cultural interests. Critics draw parallels between these oligarchs and Trump, suggesting that both share a penchant for wealth accumulation and a focus on personal gain.

The geopolitical landscape has shifted significantly since 2014, when the United States imposed sanctions on Russian oligarchs in response to the Kremlin's aggressive actions in Ukraine. With the prospect of a Trump presidency, there are fears that these sanctions could be lifted, potentially benefiting both Trump and the oligarchs who have invested in his properties. This scenario raises critical questions about the potential conflict of interest between Trump's personal financial interests and his responsibilities as the leader of the nation.

The implications of Trump's financial ties to Russian interests extend beyond mere business transactions. Observers are increasingly concerned about Trump's ability to prioritize national interests over personal gain. The possibility that he could leverage his position to benefit himself financially, while simultaneously easing sanctions on Russian oligarchs, presents a troubling conflict that cannot be overlooked.

As the public grapples with these revelations, the call for accountability has grown louder. Many are urging Congress to take action, with some advocating for impeachment proceedings against Trump. The sentiment among critics is that the potential for compromised national security and foreign policy decisions driven by personal financial interests warrants serious consideration and intervention.

In light of these developments, the American public is left to ponder the ramifications of a Trump presidency on U.S. foreign policy. The intertwining of personal wealth and political power raises fundamental questions about the integrity of leadership and the prioritization of national interests. As the election draws nearer, the scrutiny of Trump's connections to Russia is likely to intensify, and the discourse surrounding his foreign policy will remain a focal point for voters.

In conclusion, the allegations surrounding Donald Trump's ties to Russian interests and the implications for his foreign policy present a complex and troubling landscape. The potential for conflicts of interest, coupled with the influence of Russian oligarchs, raises critical questions about the future of U.S. foreign relations under a Trump administration. As the nation prepares for the upcoming election, the call for accountability and transparency remains paramount, with many advocating for Congress to take decisive action in response to these concerns.",27.0,12.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,740.0,0.41379310344827586,0.016216216216216217
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing the looming prospect of impeachment as the fallout from the ""Bridgegate"" scandal continues to unfold. Top state legislators are reportedly considering filing articles of impeachment against Christie if he is found guilty of orchestrating the controversial closure of the George Washington Bridge as a means of punishing a political rival.

The scandal, which has already led to significant legal repercussions for several of Christie's senior aides, has drawn the attention of federal prosecutors, who recently implicated the governor during a trial involving three of his former staff members. As the investigation deepens, a judge has ordered Christie to produce personal emails related to the scandal, increasing scrutiny on the governor's actions during the tumultuous events surrounding the bridge closure.

The decision to move forward with impeachment proceedings ultimately rests in the hands of Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. Should he approve the motion, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would be responsible for handling the impeachment process. To initiate impeachment, a majority of the 80-member Assembly must vote in favor, while a two-thirds majority in the Senate would be necessary for a conviction.

The Bridgegate scandal, which resulted in significant traffic jams and even one death due to delayed emergency services, has severely tarnished Christie's political reputation. Once viewed as a potential leader of the Republican Party, Christie has seen his standing diminish significantly in the wake of the scandal. Evidence has emerged indicating that he was aware of the bridge closure during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 but failed to take any action to address the situation.

Christie's current role as chairperson of Donald Trump's transition team adds another layer of complexity to the situation. His close association with Trump, who has been a prominent supporter of Christie's political career, may further complicate the response to the potential impeachment charges. Observers are keenly watching for any reactions from Trump regarding the developments surrounding Christie, especially given the governor's previously strong support for the former president.

As New Jersey navigates this political crisis, the implications of the potential impeachment could resonate far beyond the state's borders. The outcome of the proceedings against Christie may not only influence his future but could also have ramifications for the broader Republican Party, particularly as it seeks to maintain unity and a clear direction in the wake of ongoing controversies.

The political landscape in New Jersey is shifting, and as the investigation into the Bridgegate scandal continues, the pressure mounts on Christie to address the allegations against him. With top state legislators weighing their options and the public's attention fixed firmly on the unfolding drama, the coming weeks are likely to be pivotal for the governor's political future.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a fiery Republican primary debate in September 2015, Donald Trump made a bold assertion: he claimed he never lobbied then-Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling, stating confidently that if he had wanted to, he would have succeeded. This declaration, however, has since ignited a series of questions regarding the veracity of Trump's statements, particularly in light of his admissions during a deposition in 2007, where he acknowledged efforts to influence the state’s gambling policies.

The implications of this contradiction are significant, raising the specter of potential perjury. Trump's assertion in the debate directly conflicts with his earlier testimony, where he explicitly stated that he had indeed pushed for casino gambling in Florida. The stakes of this dispute delve deeper than mere political rivalry; they touch upon the integrity of a candidate vying for the highest office in the land.

During the debate, Jeb Bush did not hesitate to challenge Trump’s claims. He countered Trump's assertion by stating unequivocally that Trump had sought to influence him regarding casino gambling. This exchange not only underscored a factual dispute between the two candidates but also painted a troubling picture of Trump's relationship with the truth. The debate became a platform for Bush to highlight what he described as Trump's tendency to distort reality, a theme that has echoed throughout Trump’s political career.

The context of the debate and the ensuing discussion draws unsettling parallels to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced his own scandal involving allegations of lying under oath. Clinton’s impeachment was rooted in his denial of having an affair, a situation that ultimately led to significant political fallout. Similarly, Trump's conflicting narratives raise questions about his honesty and integrity, with critics warning that such behavior could have dire consequences for the political landscape.

Critics of Trump have long pointed to his propensity to fabricate stories and embellish facts as a troubling aspect of his candidacy. This tendency to distort the truth not only undermines public trust but also poses a potential threat to democratic processes. The stakes are high, and the consequences of such behavior could reverberate through the political system and beyond.

To illustrate the conflicting narratives surrounding Trump’s claims, transcripts from both the debate and the 2007 deposition provide a stark contrast. In the deposition, Trump stated, “I was pushing very hard for casino gambling in Florida,” a statement that directly contradicts his claim during the debate. This inconsistency raises serious questions about Trump's credibility and whether he can be trusted to uphold the truth as a leader.

The debate showcased a broader issue within the Republican primary, where candidates often engage in fierce battles over their records and integrity. However, Trump's approach to these discussions has been marked by an unwillingness to accept failure or acknowledge past mistakes. This inability to admit wrongdoing or misjudgment leads to a pattern of behavior that some argue is indicative of a larger problem: a detachment from reality that could have serious implications for the future of the Republican Party and the nation as a whole.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the question of Trump's honesty remains at the forefront of discussions among voters and political analysts alike. The potential for impeachment looms as a serious consideration for Congress, especially if evidence emerges that further substantiates claims of dishonesty or misconduct. The call for accountability is growing, with many advocating for Congress to take action against Trump, should the facts warrant such measures.

In conclusion, the debate between Trump and Bush in September 2015 serves as a microcosm of the larger issues surrounding truth and integrity in politics today. Trump's claims raise significant questions about his honesty, particularly when viewed alongside his past statements. The potential for impeachment is a serious consideration that cannot be ignored, as the integrity of the office of the President hangs in the balance. As the nation grapples with these issues, the need for transparency and accountability in leadership has never been more critical.",-29.0,-45.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,768.0,-1.6071428571428572,-0.05859375
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a drinking game during the CNN debate, where drinking occurred for each lie told by Donald Trump.

- Based on this average, it is estimated Trump told about 28 lies during the CNN debate with Clinton.
- The Surgeon General cautioned that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate.
- Viewers were advised to drink responsibly during future debates, especially given Trump's tendency to lie.","**Surgeon General Warns Against Drinking Games During Political Debates**

As political debates heat up, a concerning trend has emerged among viewers: drinking games that involve consuming alcohol every time a candidate tells a lie. This phenomenon was particularly noted during the recent CNN debate featuring Donald Trump, where many participants engaged in such games, raising alarms about the potential health risks.

US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has publicly cautioned against the dangers associated with these drinking games. He emphasized that the behavior exhibited by the Republican candidates, particularly Trump, could lead to severe consequences, including alcohol poisoning. Murthy's warnings are not unfounded; in 2012 alone, there were approximately 70,000 incidents related to alcohol poisoning linked to drinking games during debates.

With the first presidential debate approaching on September 26, 2016, Murthy reiterated his concerns, specifically highlighting the risks of excessive drinking when Trump is involved. During a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, Trump was reported to have told 87 lies, averaging a lie every 3 minutes and 15 seconds, according to Politico. This staggering statistic raises the possibility that viewers could consume significant amounts of alcohol during debates, especially if they stick to the drinking game rules based on Trump's statements.

Estimates suggest that during the CNN debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump may have told around 28 lies, which could lead to a dangerously high intake of alcohol for those participating in the drinking game. In light of this, Murthy warned that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate, underscoring the serious implications of such reckless behavior.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, viewers are urged to drink responsibly during future debates. The Surgeon General's advice serves as a critical reminder that while political engagement is essential, it should not come at the cost of personal health and safety. As the debates unfold, it is crucial for participants to prioritize their well-being over the entertainment value of drinking games, especially given the unpredictable nature of political discourse.",-17.0,-15.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,379.0,-1.1538461538461537,-0.0395778364116095
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In a striking contrast to the mainstream media's portrayal, Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner of the recent debate. However, the online landscape tells a different story, with many users expressing support for her opponent, Donald Trump. The hashtag #TrumpWon has surged in popularity on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, where it has been trending prominently.

Interestingly, the origins of the #TrumpWon hashtag have been traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. This revelation raises concerns about the authenticity of online sentiments, as Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has been known to employ cyber-trolls and bloggers to further his agenda through disinformation campaigns. These tactics are designed to sow discord and deepen divisions among U.S. allies, creating an environment of mistrust and confusion.

Putin's strategy appears to include promoting Trump, who has indicated that he may lift sanctions against Russia and overlook potential aggression in Eastern Europe. This alignment raises alarms about the implications for U.S. foreign policy and national security, should Trump gain further influence.

Ex-bloggers from Russia have come forward to describe their working conditions as harsh, revealing a system that imposes fines for tardiness and mandates strict post quotas. This insight underscores the orchestrated nature of the online discourse surrounding political events in the U.S. and highlights the importance of scrutinizing the motivations behind trending topics.

Given the complexities of the digital landscape, experts caution against placing too much trust in online polls and social media trends. The possibility that these platforms are being manipulated by Russian operatives adds a layer of uncertainty to the public's perception of political events. Engaging with these trolls may further perpetuate disinformation, making it crucial for individuals to remain vigilant and discerning about the information they consume.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call to action for citizens to demand accountability from their elected officials. Many are urging Congress to consider impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump, reflecting widespread concerns about his potential ties to foreign influence and the ramifications for American democracy.

As the debate continues, the divergence between mainstream media narratives and online sentiments highlights the challenges of navigating a politically charged environment increasingly influenced by external forces. The implications of these dynamics will likely resonate in the political discourse leading up to the next election cycle.",-9.0,6.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,432.0,0.35294117647058826,0.013888888888888888
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a data analytics company controlled by tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor, which alleges systematic discrimination in the company's hiring practices. The lawsuit specifically claims that Palantir has engaged in discriminatory behavior against Asian job applicants during its recruitment process.

The allegations stem from an examination of the hiring outcomes for engineering intern positions at Palantir. According to the lawsuit, out of 130 applicants for these roles, a striking 73% were identified as Asian. However, the hiring figures reveal a stark disparity: only four Asian candidates were offered positions, while 17 non-Asian candidates were hired. This significant imbalance raises serious questions about the company's hiring practices and has prompted the Department of Labor to take action.

The lawsuit goes further to quantify the improbability of such hiring outcomes occurring by chance. Experts cited in the legal filing estimate that the likelihood of this hiring pattern is approximately one in a billion, suggesting that the results are not merely coincidental but indicative of a deeper issue within Palantir's hiring protocols.

Palantir Technologies, known for its role as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), has found itself in a challenging position as it faces these serious allegations. The company has announced its intention to defend itself vigorously, denying any claims of bias in its hiring practices. As a federal contractor, Palantir is bound by regulations that require it to uphold non-discriminatory hiring practices, a point emphasized by the Director of the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). The director highlighted the obligation of federal contractors to ensure fair and equitable hiring processes, reinforcing the importance of this lawsuit.

Peter Thiel, the company’s co-founder and a notable figure in the tech industry, has a complex background that adds a layer of intrigue to the situation. Thiel is a first-generation immigrant, with his parents having sought opportunities in the technology sector. Despite his personal history, Thiel has been known to support anti-immigration candidates, a stance that has drawn criticism and raised questions about his views on diversity and inclusion within his own company.

Thiel is also recognized for his role as a co-founder of PayPal and as an early investor in Facebook, which has established him as a significant player in the tech landscape. His public persona gained further notoriety when he funded Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, ultimately leading to the media company's bankruptcy. This incident highlighted Thiel's willingness to engage in high-profile legal battles, a trait that may come into play as Palantir prepares to contest the discrimination allegations.

In addition to his business ventures, Thiel made headlines when he became the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention. His speech, which advocated for individual identity and criticized government inefficiency, was well-received by many attendees. However, it also stood in stark contrast to the Republican Party's adoption of an anti-LGBT platform, showcasing the complexities of Thiel's identity and political affiliations.

As the lawsuit unfolds, it will undoubtedly attract significant media attention and public scrutiny. The outcome could have far-reaching implications not only for Palantir Technologies but also for the broader conversation surrounding diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. The Department of Labor's intervention highlights the increasing focus on ensuring that federal contractors adhere to fair hiring practices, a trend that is likely to continue as more organizations face similar scrutiny.

In conclusion, the allegations against Palantir Technologies present a critical moment for the company and its leadership. As it prepares to mount a defense against the claims of employment discrimination, the tech giant finds itself at the intersection of legal challenges, public perception, and the ongoing discourse around diversity in the workplace. The case serves as a reminder of the responsibilities that come with being a federal contractor and the imperative for companies to foster inclusive hiring practices.",-18.0,-11.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,744.0,-0.4074074074074074,-0.01478494623655914
Fake_65-Webpage,Note In Arabic Found With NYC Bomb… Call Says There Will Be More Bombings,"Note In Arabic Found With NYC Bomb… Call Says There Will Be More Bombings

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

Authorities are actively pursuing leads in the investigation of the Chelsea bombing that occurred on Saturday, injuring 29 individuals. Fortunately, all injured parties have since been discharged from the hospital, and the community is beginning to regain a sense of normalcy amid the chaos.

The investigation took a dramatic turn when a second pressure-cooker bomb was unearthed in a Dumpster located just four blocks from the site of the initial explosion. This discovery has heightened concerns among law enforcement and the public alike, prompting an urgent response to ensure the safety of the area.

Three significant leads have emerged in the ongoing investigation, each raising questions and concerns about the motivations behind the attacks. 

The first lead involves a hand-written letter, partially composed in Arabic, which was found alongside the second explosive device. The content and intent of the letter remain unclear, but its discovery adds an additional layer of complexity to the investigation.

The second lead comes from an unidentified male caller who contacted 911 to issue a chilling warning about potential further explosions. The caller ominously stated, ""There will be more,"" leaving authorities on high alert and prompting them to increase security measures in the vicinity.

The third lead is particularly alarming, as it involves a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber.’ The page claims to serve as the bomber's manifesto, outlining grievances against various societal issues, with a particular focus on the LGBTQ+ community and racism. The post not only expresses discontent with the treatment of these groups but also indicates a broader agenda, suggesting that the explosives were merely tests and that the author intends to continue their actions against what they perceive as societal injustices.

The Tumblr post makes a bold declaration: ""This is not the end, this is just the beginning,"" signaling a desire to create a lasting impact through these actions. This statement has raised alarm among law enforcement officials, who are now grappling with the potential for future threats.

However, there is a growing skepticism surrounding the authenticity of the claims made in the Tumblr post. Some experts suggest that the individual behind the page may be attempting to exploit the tragic situation for attention rather than genuinely advocating for the causes mentioned. This uncertainty complicates the investigation, as authorities must discern whether the threats are credible or simply the ramblings of someone seeking notoriety.

As the investigation continues, police are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. The community is still reeling from the shock of the bombing, and the discovery of a second device has only amplified fears regarding safety in the area.

Law enforcement officials are working diligently to piece together the information gathered from the leads and to determine the legitimacy of the threats posed by the Tumblr post. The investigation remains a top priority, with investigators committed to ensuring that those responsible for the attacks are brought to justice.

In the wake of the Chelsea bombing, the resilience of the community is being tested, but the collaboration between law enforcement and residents serves as a reminder that vigilance and unity are crucial in the face of adversity. As the investigation unfolds, the hope remains that answers will emerge, providing clarity and reassurance to a shaken community.",-25.0,-11.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,611.0,-0.5,-0.01800327332242226
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As the presidential campaign intensifies, Donald Trump has been actively campaigning for months, but recent signs of fatigue have raised eyebrows among supporters and critics alike. At 70 years old, the former president continues to hold rallies across the country, including a last-minute event in Roanoke, Virginia, aimed at energizing his base. However, with less than 24 hours to go before a crucial debate against Hillary Clinton, Trump's behavior has become increasingly erratic.

In a concerning display, Trump took to Twitter to share an incoherent message that spanned three unrelated topics: a shooting in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina. This tweet has sparked discussions about his mental fitness and preparedness for the upcoming debate. Observers noted that the message, which seemed to reflect a wandering mind, could indicate that Trump is struggling to maintain focus as the campaign enters its final stretch.

The timing of Trump's tweet has raised alarms among political analysts, who suggest that such erratic behavior may hint at a potential decline in his campaign. With the stakes high in the debate, which could significantly impact voter sentiment, concerns are mounting about whether Trump can effectively present his policies and counter Clinton's arguments.

Critics have pointed to this recent incident as evidence of a broader issue regarding Trump's mental acuity, particularly as he juggles the demands of a high-pressure campaign. The juxtaposition of his vigorous rally schedule with moments of apparent disarray has led to questions about his ability to handle the rigors of the presidential race.

As the debate looms, the spotlight will be on Trump to see if he can rally and deliver a strong performance against Clinton. His supporters remain hopeful that he can overcome these recent challenges, while opponents are eager to capitalize on any missteps. With the election approaching, every moment counts, and Trump's ability to maintain composure and clarity could prove pivotal in shaping the outcome of the race. 

As the nation watches closely, the implications of Trump's recent behavior may not only affect his debate performance but also the trajectory of his campaign as he strives to secure a second term.",-22.0,5.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,412.0,0.35714285714285715,0.012135922330097087

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio – In a stark contrast to the fervent atmosphere typically associated with campaign events, Hillary Clinton's door-knocking initiative held on a recent afternoon at 1 pm turned out to be a quiet affair, drawing only one attendee—a supporter of her rival, Donald Trump. The event, designed to rally volunteers and engage with the community, was anticipated to attract many enthusiastic participants, but instead, it highlighted growing concerns regarding Clinton's support in key states.

As staff members awaited the arrival of volunteers, they were taken aback when the only individual to show up was a Trump supporter. Upon recognizing his political affiliation, campaign staff promptly asked him to leave, emphasizing the campaign's intent to foster a supportive environment for Clinton's advocates. This unexpected turn of events not only underscored the lack of turnout but also raised questions about the effectiveness of Clinton's ground game in a critical election year.

Despite the campaign office's thorough preparations, the absence of volunteers at the event signals potential issues that could impact Clinton's overall campaign strategy. The expectation was that local supporters would rally to participate in grassroots efforts, yet the reality painted a different picture. With only staff members present, the event served as a reminder of the challenges Clinton faces as she seeks to galvanize support in an increasingly competitive political landscape.

The low attendance at the door-knocking event has sparked discussions about Clinton's broader appeal across various states. Political analysts are beginning to express concerns that her campaign may be struggling to resonate with voters, particularly in battleground regions where enthusiasm is crucial. This situation stands in stark contrast to the large crowds consistently seen at Trump rallies, where supporters gather in droves, energized by the former president's messaging and presence.

As the campaign unfolds, speculation regarding Clinton's effectiveness continues to grow, especially with Trump currently leading in polls and navigating through various controversies that have arisen during the election cycle. The juxtaposition of Clinton's subdued events against the backdrop of Trump's high-energy rallies raises critical questions about voter engagement and the ability of Clinton's campaign to mobilize support.

The Delaware event, while intended to be a strategic outreach effort, has inadvertently highlighted the challenges that lie ahead for Clinton. With only one individual showing up, it reflects a potential disconnect between her campaign messaging and the sentiments of the electorate. As the campaign progresses, the focus will likely shift to addressing these gaps and finding ways to invigorate her base in order to compete effectively against Trump and other candidates.

In conclusion, the door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, serves as a microcosm of the larger issues facing Hillary Clinton's campaign. With dwindling volunteer turnout and concerns about her support in key states, the path forward may require a reevaluation of strategies to better engage voters. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the effectiveness of Clinton's campaign will be tested in the coming months, making it imperative for her team to address these challenges head-on.",-7.0,34.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,576.0,1.7894736842105263,0.059027777777777776

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a bombing incident in New York City, former President Donald Trump has taken to the airwaves to express his outrage over media coverage, particularly criticizing CNN for its handling of the event. The incident, which has sent shockwaves through the city, prompted Trump to label it a “bombing” shortly after it occurred. However, his use of the term was met with backlash from CNN, which has been accused of bias in its reporting.

CNN's criticism of Trump centered on his choice of words, suggesting that his description was inappropriate. Ironically, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had also referred to the incident as a bombing, but CNN chose to edit her remarks out of its coverage. This selective reporting has raised eyebrows and fueled Trump's accusations of dishonesty in the media.

In a segment on Fox and Friends, Trump did not hold back his disdain for CNN, calling the network ""disgusting and disgraceful."" He expressed his frustration over what he perceives as a double standard in media reporting, emphasizing that his characterization of the bombing was accurate. Trump went further, dubbing CNN the ""Clinton news network,"" a jab at what he believes is the network's favoritism towards the former First Lady and her political agenda.

Trump's remarks did not stop at media criticism; he also took aim at current leaders, labeling them as ""stupid"" for their handling of terrorism. He argued that the United States has been too lenient in its approach to dealing with threats, suggesting a need for tougher measures to combat terrorism effectively. This call for a more aggressive stance resonates with his supporters, who have long viewed national security as a paramount issue.

In addition to his criticisms of media and leadership, Trump voiced concerns over the influx of refugees into the country. He specifically targeted former President Barack Obama's plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees, as well as Clinton's proposal to significantly increase that number. Trump has consistently argued that the vetting process for refugees is inadequate, raising alarms about the potential for dangerous individuals to enter the United States under the guise of seeking asylum.

The former president's comments reflect a broader narrative that has been a cornerstone of his political platform: the need for stricter immigration policies and a more robust approach to national security. By tying the recent bombing to his longstanding concerns about terrorism and refugee vetting, Trump aims to galvanize support among those who share his views on these critical issues.

As the conversation surrounding the bombing continues, the contrasting narratives between Trump and the media highlight the ongoing tensions in American political discourse. Trump's focus on the bombing, coupled with his criticism of CNN, underscores his strategy of positioning himself as a strong leader in times of crisis. 

While the details of the bombing are still unfolding, the political implications are clear. Trump's remarks are likely to resonate with his base, who may view his direct approach as a refreshing alternative to what they perceive as the media's biased reporting. As the nation grapples with the aftermath of the attack, the discourse surrounding security, immigration, and media integrity will undoubtedly remain at the forefront of public discussion.

In a world where information travels rapidly and narratives can shift in an instant, the interplay between political figures and the media continues to shape the landscape of American politics. Trump's assertions regarding the bombing and his critique of CNN serve as a reminder of the powerful role that language and perception play in influencing public opinion and policy.",-45.0,-22.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,682.0,-0.9166666666666666,-0.03225806451612903

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

In a surprising turn of events, Ahmad Rahami, a figure known for his involvement in terrorism and murder, has initiated a lawsuit against the police in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The legal action, filed in federal court in Newark, centers around allegations of discrimination faced by Rahami's family due to their Afghan heritage and Muslim faith, despite Ahmad Rahami's criminal history, which includes the planting of bombs.

The Rahami family, owners of a local chicken restaurant since 2002, claims they have been subjected to ongoing harassment from local officials who allegedly aim to shut down their business. They assert that the harassment has manifested in the form of numerous unjust tickets and court summonses, particularly for staying open past the 10 PM curfew, a practice they contend they were legally allowed to do.

The family, which includes Ahmad Rahami (28), his father Mohammad Sr. (53), and his brother Mohammad, has reported experiencing racial abuse from local residents. The lawsuit claims that this discrimination is rooted in their cultural background, which has been exacerbated by Ahmad's notorious actions. The family argues that the police have shown a ""reckless disregard"" for their constitutional rights, alleging that law enforcement engaged in harassment tactics aimed at forcing their restaurant to close early.

Further complicating the narrative, police have reportedly expressed concerns about the level of crime in the area surrounding the Rahami family’s business, stating that there was ""too much crime around here"" and indicating that the neighborhood is known for criminal activity. This backdrop raises questions about the motivations behind the legal action, especially given Ahmad Rahami's arrest for terrorism five years after the lawsuit was filed.

The irony of a known terrorist seeking redress for perceived discrimination has not gone unnoticed. Observers are left questioning whether Rahami's actions were influenced by a sense of being targeted due to his family's background or if they stemmed from deeper extremist beliefs. The lawsuit, which could potentially shed light on the intersection of cultural identity and law enforcement practices, has sparked discussions among community members and legal experts alike.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the implications of the Rahami family's claims will be closely monitored. The case serves as a reminder of the complex dynamics at play in communities grappling with issues of race, culture, and crime. While Ahmad Rahami's past actions loom large over the proceedings, the family's allegations of discrimination and harassment raise critical questions about the treatment of minority communities and the role of law enforcement in addressing these concerns. The outcome of the lawsuit may not only impact the Rahami family but also set a precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future.",-49.0,-64.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,519.0,-4.0,-0.1233140655105973
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent discussions have resurfaced regarding pay-to-play corruption linked to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising eyebrows about the organization’s true purpose. As allegations mount, the Clinton campaign has countered by emphasizing the foundation's positive contributions to various charitable causes. However, critics argue that the foundation primarily served as a profit-making entity for the Clintons and their associates.

The Clinton Foundation has faced scrutiny over its financial practices, particularly in the wake of claims suggesting that it needed to maintain an image of charity to uphold its credibility. This perception is challenged by alarming statistics regarding its financial allocations. According to a report by The Daily Caller, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget in 2014 was directed toward charitable grants. This figure raises questions about the foundation's commitment to philanthropy, especially given that it spent nearly $91.3 million that year, with less than $5.2 million earmarked for charitable initiatives.

The financial breakdown reveals that a significant portion of the foundation's budget was devoted to salaries and employee benefits, amounting to $34.8 million. Additionally, $50.4 million was categorized under ""other expenses,"" which has led to further speculation about the foundation's operational priorities. Notably, charitable spending saw a dramatic decline of 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite the foundation's revenue increasing by an additional $30 million.

The increase in spending on salaries and other expenses by $5 million in 2014 has drawn criticism from watchdog groups and opponents of the Clintons, who argue that these financial decisions reflect a troubling trend. The foundation's operational model raises concerns about whether its activities are genuinely philanthropic or primarily serve to enrich the Clintons.

The overarching narrative suggests that the Clinton Foundation has functioned as a vehicle for the Clintons to amass wealth, particularly leveraging Hillary Clinton's position as Secretary of State for financial gain. The implications of these allegations are significant, as they challenge the integrity of one of the most high-profile charitable organizations in the world.

As the debate continues, the Clinton campaign's defense of the foundation's contributions may not be enough to quell the concerns surrounding its financial practices. The ongoing scrutiny reflects a broader conversation about transparency and accountability in charitable organizations, especially those intertwined with political figures.",25.0,17.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,437.0,1.0625,0.038901601830663615

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York, former President Barack Obama has left many Americans shocked and disillusioned. The address, which was anticipated to offer solidarity in the wake of recent violent incidents, has instead drawn heavy criticism for its tone and focus.

The backdrop of Obama’s speech included a series of alarming events: bombings in New York and New Jersey, along with a stabbing in Minnesota. These tragic occurrences had left the public looking for reassurance and a statement of unity from their elected officials. However, rather than addressing these pressing issues, Obama shifted his attention to a high-dollar fundraiser, prompting outrage from those who felt he had missed a crucial opportunity to acknowledge the victims and their families.

Critics have been vocal in their condemnation of the former president's remarks. One speaker, who took to social media to express their discontent, labeled Obama as ""useless"" and ""arrogant."" This sentiment echoes a growing frustration among citizens who expected their leaders to respond to crises with empathy and support.

During his address, Obama chose to focus on broader societal issues, expressing concerns about ""sexism"" in the media landscape. He specifically targeted controversial figures such as Rush Limbaugh and the network Fox News, criticizing their roles in perpetuating negative narratives. While these topics are undoubtedly important, many have questioned the relevance of such discussions in the immediate aftermath of violent attacks that have shaken communities.

Furthermore, Obama directed his criticism toward Donald Trump, while simultaneously praising Hillary Clinton. This political commentary, however, seemed to overshadow the gravity of the recent tragedies. Critics argue that Obama lacked the necessary information to comment on the attacks, but the speaker believes that a basic acknowledgment of the victims and the circumstances surrounding the violence was not only warranted but essential.

The public's reaction has been one of disgust and disappointment. Many feel that Obama’s failure to directly address the situation reflects a disconnect between political leaders and the realities faced by everyday Americans. In times of crisis, citizens often look to their leaders for guidance and reassurance, and the absence of such a response can lead to feelings of isolation and neglect.

As the nation grapples with the aftermath of these violent incidents, the expectation for leadership remains high. The public is left wondering how figures like Obama can prioritize fundraising and political commentary over the urgent need for solidarity and compassion in the face of tragedy. 

The speech has ignited a broader conversation about the responsibilities of public figures during times of crisis. While political discourse is important, the necessity for empathy and acknowledgment of suffering cannot be understated. As the nation continues to heal from the wounds of violence, the hope is that leaders will rise to the occasion and provide the support and solidarity that communities so desperately need.

In conclusion, Obama’s recent speech has not only shocked many Americans but has also raised critical questions about the role of leadership in addressing violence and tragedy. As citizens reflect on the events of the past few days, the expectation for a more compassionate and responsive political environment grows ever stronger.",-25.0,-60.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,599.0,-2.5,-0.1001669449081803
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

In recent months, public awareness of corruption allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation has intensified, particularly since Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A new report has surfaced, indicating that the foundation is grappling with serious issues that could have significant implications for its future.

According to The Daily Caller, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), one of the foundation's most significant and well-known initiatives, has been implicated in the distribution of ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. This alarming revelation raises concerns about the quality of healthcare provided to vulnerable populations.

A draft congressional report suggests that the distribution of these potentially adulterated drugs ""likely increased"" morbidity and mortality risks for patients relying on effective treatment. As the extent of the impact on AIDS patients remains unclear, the situation has prompted urgent calls for action.

The report also sheds light on connections between former President Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-Americans who have faced investigations by the FDA and the SEC. These connections have further fueled skepticism regarding the foundation's operations and its commitment to ethical practices.

Particularly concerning is the foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, an Indian pharmaceutical firm with a documented history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the FDA. Such associations have led to increased scrutiny of the Clinton charity, especially as Hillary Clinton gears up for her presidential campaign.

As allegations surrounding the distribution of substandard AIDS drugs continue to surface, critics are calling for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further harm to patients and to restore public trust.

Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for enacting poorly worded laws that are inadvertently criminalizing essential parenting activities. One particular law has raised significant concerns among legal experts and parents alike due to its vague language and unintended consequences.

The law in question criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals, a provision that, while ostensibly aimed at protecting children from molesters, has significant implications for routine parenting tasks such as diaper changes and baths. Critics argue that the legislation fails to account for the normal and necessary interactions that occur between parents and their children, leading to a chilling effect on parental care.

In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court stated that parents must now prove a lack of sexual intent when charged under this law. This requirement has sparked outrage as it undermines the fundamental presumption of innocence that is a cornerstone of the American legal system. Legal expert John Pfaff has pointed out that this shift places an undue burden on parents, who must navigate an increasingly treacherous legal landscape while performing everyday caregiving tasks.

The court's decision has raised questions about the reliance on prosecutorial discretion rather than a straightforward revision of the problematic law. Critics argue that this reliance may lead to arbitrary enforcement, where innocent actions by parents could be misconstrued as criminal behavior. As a result, many parents are left feeling vulnerable and uncertain about their ability to care for their children without the risk of legal repercussions.

Pfaff also highlighted the troubling dynamics of plea bargaining in these cases. Defendants may feel pressured to plead guilty to lesser charges to avoid the severe consequences associated with the original allegations. This pressure can lead to wrongful convictions and a significant erosion of due process, as individuals may opt for a plea deal rather than risk a lengthy and costly trial.

Moreover, the implications of Arizona's laws extend beyond individual cases, raising concerns about the potential for intimidation and coercion of parents and caregivers. The vague language of the law may allow for prosecutorial harassment, where parents could be unjustly targeted for actions that are inherently benign and necessary for child-rearing.

Skepticism abounds regarding the government's capacity to manage the legal implications of these laws effectively. Many observers worry that the current legal framework may do more harm than good, ultimately failing to protect children while simultaneously infringing on the rights of parents. 

As the debate continues, advocates for parental rights are calling for a comprehensive review and revision of the legislation to ensure that it effectively protects children without criminalizing innocent parenting behavior. The situation in Arizona serves as a cautionary tale for lawmakers across the country, illustrating the delicate balance between safeguarding children and upholding the rights of parents. 

With ongoing discussions surrounding the law, it remains to be seen how Arizona's legislature will respond to the mounting criticism and whether meaningful changes will be made to prevent the criminalization of essential parenting activities.",-12.0,-42.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,549.0,-2.1,-0.07650273224043716

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one.

As the political landscape shifts with the potential return of Hillary Clinton to the White House, speculation is mounting regarding the role Michelle Obama might play in a Clinton administration. While many Democrats are eager to see a familiar face return to power, the prospect of Michelle Obama remaining active in the White House has sparked a mix of excitement and discomfort among political commentators and the public alike.

The idea of Michelle Obama continuing her involvement in government raises questions about her qualifications for a potential role. Critics have expressed discomfort with the notion of covering the Obamas again, suggesting that the couple's time in the spotlight should have concluded with Barack Obama's presidency. This sentiment is fueled by a growing skepticism regarding Michelle Obama’s legacy, particularly concerning her initiatives during her husband’s administration.

One of the most talked-about aspects of Michelle Obama’s legacy is her school lunch program, which aimed to provide healthier food options for children across the nation. While the initiative was lauded by some, it has faced criticism for its implementation and the perceived overreach into the lives of American families. Detractors argue that the program did not adequately consider the diverse needs and preferences of children, leading to food waste and dissatisfaction among students. 

Additionally, Michelle Obama’s controversial statements about national pride have also drawn scrutiny. Her remarks have led to questions about her understanding of the American experience and the values that resonate with many citizens. This criticism raises further doubts about her suitability for a prominent role in a future administration, particularly one that may prioritize government involvement in parenting and child-rearing.

Hillary Clinton has long been an advocate for government intervention in child-rearing, believing that public policy should play a significant role in shaping the upbringing of children. This philosophy aligns with Michelle Obama’s ongoing campaign for healthy living for children, which she intends to pursue indefinitely. The former First Lady’s commitment to promoting healthier lifestyles among youth has garnered support from various health organizations and advocates, but it also raises concerns about the extent of government influence in personal and family matters.

The potential for a Clinton administration to leverage Michelle Obama’s popularity as a political strategy is palpable. Many speculate that Clinton may seek to attract voters who admire the Obamas, hoping to recreate the sense of hope and change that characterized Barack Obama’s presidency. This strategy could serve to galvanize a base that appreciates the Obamas' contributions to public life and their focus on health and wellness.

However, the prospect of a progressive agenda influencing American education and parenting raises alarms among some critics. Concerns about the role of government in shaping the upbringing of children have become a contentious issue, with many arguing that such involvement undermines parental authority and traditional values. The debate over educational policy and the extent of government intervention in family life continues to be a divisive topic in American politics.

As speculation continues about Michelle Obama’s future role in a potential Clinton administration, it is clear that her legacy remains a complex and contested topic. While many applaud her efforts to promote healthy living and education, others question the implications of her initiatives and the broader influence of progressivism on American society. The intersection of these issues will likely be a focal point of discussion as the political landscape evolves in the coming years.",6.0,20.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,639.0,0.8695652173913043,0.03129890453834116

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep.

Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has erupted involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), as allegations surface regarding the distribution of ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa. The initiative, which has long been touted for its efforts to improve access to essential health services in the region, is now under fire for allegedly contributing to the deaths of numerous Africans by providing ineffective treatment options.

The controversy centers around Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has been implicated in the distribution of these substandard drugs. Ranbaxy was found guilty in 2013 of multiple counts of fraud and introducing adulterated drugs into commerce, leading to a staggering $500 million fine. The company has faced scrutiny for its quality control practices, which have raised serious concerns about the safety and efficacy of its products.

A congressional report titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, has brought to light the relationship between CHAI and Ranbaxy. This report raises critical questions about the Clintons' awareness of the quality issues surrounding the drugs distributed through their initiative. Blackburn has called into question the impact on patients, poignantly asking how many lives may have been lost due to the false promises of effective treatment that were not delivered.

The report also suggests that the Clinton charities may face increased scrutiny as investigations continue into inappropriate ties with Indian-Americans that have been sanctioned by both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This growing scrutiny comes at a time when the integrity of the Clinton Foundation is being challenged, with allegations of rampant corruption surfacing in connection with its operations.

Despite the known quality control issues and fraudulent reporting to the FDA, the Clinton Foundation allegedly continued to promote Ranbaxy as a partner in its efforts to distribute HIV medications. In 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy specifically for the distribution of these critical medications, a decision that is now being questioned in light of the company's record.

Experts have issued dire warnings regarding the implications of substandard HIV medications. They assert that such drugs can lead to severe health complications, potentially accelerating death from related infections. The ramifications of these findings are particularly troubling given the ongoing public health crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to effective HIV treatment is already a significant challenge.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, it is noted that while Ranbaxy's generic drugs are banned in the United States, they continue to be sold globally. This raises further questions about the role of the Clinton Foundation in maintaining ties with a company that has faced serious legal challenges over the quality of its products. The ongoing relationship between CHAI and Ranbaxy may suggest a troubling prioritization of financial gain over the welfare of individuals, particularly in vulnerable communities across Africa.

The implications of this scandal are far-reaching, as it not only calls into question the practices of the Clinton Health Access Initiative but also highlights broader issues of accountability within charitable organizations. The potential loss of life due to ineffective medications is a grim reminder of the stakes involved in global health initiatives, and the need for rigorous oversight in the distribution of medical treatments.

As the investigation unfolds, the public and policymakers alike are left to ponder the ethical responsibilities of organizations like the Clinton Foundation. The juxtaposition of their philanthropic mission against the backdrop of alleged corruption and negligence raises critical questions about the true motivations behind their initiatives. Are they genuinely committed to improving health outcomes, or are they more focused on securing financial partnerships that may compromise the quality of care provided to those in need?

Rep. Blackburn's report serves as a clarion call for greater transparency and accountability within the Clinton Foundation and other similar organizations. As the world grapples with the ongoing challenges of healthcare access and quality, it is imperative that those in positions of influence prioritize the health and safety of individuals over profit.

In conclusion, the emerging scandal surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its ties to Ranbaxy underscores the urgent need for vigilance in the oversight of global health initiatives. The potential consequences of distributing ineffective medications are dire, and the implications for public trust in charitable organizations are profound. As investigations continue, the focus must remain on ensuring that the health and well-being of individuals, particularly in vulnerable populations, are placed above all else. The future of global health initiatives may depend on it.",-63.0,-24.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,841.0,-0.8275862068965517,-0.028537455410225922

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant development regarding the ongoing scrutiny of Hillary Clinton's security training, a federal judge has mandated that the State Department release documents related to the security training of Clinton and her top aides within a five-day timeframe. This ruling comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit initiated by the Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which has been diligently pursuing transparency concerning the mandatory security protocols for classified materials and secure communications.

Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, rejected a motion from the State Department to dismiss the lawsuit, signaling a judicial acknowledgment of the importance of the requested information. However, he did deny TheDCNF's request to depose State Department officials, a decision that has left some legal observers questioning the extent of accountability that may be achieved through this process.

The State Department has faced criticism for its lack of documentation confirming that Clinton and her aides received the required security briefings. Specifically, the absence of records raises concerns about whether Clinton, along with former aides Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, and Jacob Sullivan, completed the necessary training on handling classified materials and secure communications. TheDCNF's pursuit of these records aims to clarify the extent of compliance with established security protocols during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

Judge Leon's ruling came after he expressed frustration with the State Department's delays in providing the requested documents. He established clear deadlines for the release of the information, requiring one-third of the documents to be made available by September 26 and the remainder by October 10. This timeline reflects the judge's commitment to ensuring that the FOIA process is upheld and that the public has access to pertinent information regarding the handling of sensitive materials by high-ranking officials.

An attorney representing TheDCNF underscored the judge's evident frustration with what has been perceived as the State Department's obstruction of the FOIA process. The ongoing delays have contributed to a growing sense of urgency for transparency, particularly in light of the implications that the lack of documentation may have on national security and accountability for government officials.

The acknowledgment by State Department officials that their failure to produce documents suggests that the required security training courses were not completed by Clinton or her aides adds another layer of complexity to the situation. This revelation has raised questions about the adherence to security protocols that are critical for safeguarding classified information, especially for individuals in positions of significant authority.

As the deadlines set by Judge Leon approach, the pressure mounts on the State Department to comply with the court's order. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications not only for the individuals involved but also for the broader discourse surrounding government transparency and accountability. TheDCNF's efforts to obtain these documents reflect a growing demand for clarity regarding the actions and decisions of public officials, particularly in matters related to national security.

The ruling serves as a reminder of the judicial system's role in overseeing government compliance with transparency laws. As the public awaits the release of the documents, the ongoing legal battle highlights the challenges faced by organizations seeking information through FOIA requests and the importance of upholding the principles of open government.

In conclusion, the federal judge's order for the State Department to release security training documents related to Hillary Clinton and her aides marks a pivotal moment in the pursuit of transparency regarding government operations. With the established deadlines for document release, the coming weeks will be critical in determining the extent to which the public can access information about the security protocols that govern the handling of classified materials by high-ranking officials. The outcome of this case will undoubtedly contribute to the ongoing dialogue about accountability and transparency in the federal government.",-5.0,0.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,706.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton approaches, the absence of a robust fact-checking mechanism has sparked significant concern among political analysts and media observers. NBC News has indicated that moderator Lester Holt will not actively fact-check the candidates during the live event, a decision that could have profound implications for the integrity of the discourse.

Without on-screen fact-checking, Trump's potential for making unchecked statements increases, placing the onus of accountability primarily on Clinton. This scenario is particularly troubling given that Trump has been reported to lie on average every three-and-a-half minutes. The lack of real-time verification allows misinformation to proliferate, potentially skewing public perception and understanding of the candidates' positions.

Major cable and broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, are also opting not to provide on-screen fact-checks during the debate. This collective decision raises questions about the role of journalism in the current electoral climate. On-screen fact-checking could serve as a crucial tool in exposing false claims, allowing viewers to receive accurate information without disrupting the flow of debate. The absence of such measures may contribute to a narrative that favors Trump, as it limits the immediate challenge to any misleading statements he might make.

Clinton's campaign has expressed concern over the moderator's role in challenging falsehoods. The campaign argues that without active intervention from Holt, Trump could gain an unfair advantage, particularly if he is allowed to propagate inaccuracies without immediate correction. Clinton is expected to perform exceptionally well in the debate to maintain her credibility, especially in light of the perceived double standard in the treatment of the candidates. 

The situation underscores a broader concern about the state of journalism as it pertains to the election. With the stakes higher than ever, the expectation for media outlets to uphold standards of accountability has never been more critical. The decision not to fact-check during the debate may reflect a shift in media practices, but it also raises ethical questions about the responsibility of journalists in informing the electorate.

As the debate nears, the implications of this lack of fact-checking are becoming increasingly clear. The integrity of the electoral process hinges on the ability of voters to access truthful information. The absence of a structured fact-checking process during such a pivotal moment in American politics could have lasting consequences on public trust and the democratic process itself.",-6.0,0.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,445.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

In a recent wave of criticism, Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has raised serious concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. Kyle's remarks come at a time when Clinton's public image is already under scrutiny, as she faces various health and character-related scandals.

Kyle asserts that Clinton's motivations are deeply rooted in anger and rage, suggesting that these emotions could lead to a physical breakdown. According to Kyle, such intense feelings are not only detrimental to Clinton's health but also raise questions about her ability to lead effectively. ""When someone is driven by such negative emotions, it can have severe consequences on both their physical and mental well-being,"" Kyle stated.

Moreover, Kyle claims that Clinton is experiencing cognitive impairment, which further complicates her fitness for the presidential role. She points to symptoms such as emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty in completing tasks as indicators of a troubling decline. These assertions paint a picture of a candidate who may not be equipped to handle the immense pressures that come with the highest office in the land.

In addition to the cognitive concerns, Kyle highlights what she perceives as troubling psychological traits in Clinton. She describes Clinton as exhibiting paranoia and controlling tendencies, characteristics that Kyle believes are particularly concerning for someone vying for the presidency. ""A leader must be able to trust their team and remain composed under pressure,"" Kyle emphasized, suggesting that Clinton's demeanor could hinder her effectiveness as a leader.

Kyle's critique is further elaborated in her book, ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" where she aims to unveil what she describes as the truth about Clinton, including her alleged health issues. In her narrative, Kyle portrays Clinton as power-hungry, claiming that she is willing to jeopardize not only her own health but also the Democratic Party's integrity in pursuit of her ambitions.

This barrage of criticism from a figure with close ties to the Clinton family adds another layer of complexity to Hillary Clinton's already challenging political landscape. As she navigates the turbulent waters of public perception, these allegations may further complicate her efforts to maintain a positive image in the eyes of voters. With health and character scandals looming, the question remains whether Clinton can overcome these hurdles as she continues to pursue her political aspirations.",-13.0,-19.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,451.0,-1.1875,-0.04212860310421286

HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In a world characterized by increasing globalization, the United States and Canada continue to grapple with the complexities of immigration. While both nations are celebrated for their diverse populations, the conversation surrounding the integration of immigrants into the dominant culture has gained renewed urgency. As America remains a nation of immigrants, there is a growing sentiment that unity and integration should take precedence over the maintenance of separate customs and traditions.

The call for immigrants to adapt to American customs resonates strongly in the current discourse. Advocates argue that newcomers should prioritize the adoption of the prevailing cultural norms rather than continuing to operate within their own distinct frameworks. This perspective is echoed by leaders across North America, including a notable Quebec mayor who has articulated a similar stance regarding Muslim immigrants in Canada. The mayor emphasizes that integration into Canadian culture is essential and that the onus is on immigrants to adapt, rather than expecting the host nation to accommodate their cultural practices.

While Canadians are generally known for their welcoming nature, there is an expectation that immigrants will respect and uphold the country's identity and cultural values. The mayor's remarks underline a crucial point: religion should remain a private matter, and public concessions to religious practices, such as those associated with Islam and Sharia law, will not be entertained. This assertion reflects a broader concern among citizens about the potential for foreign cultural influences to reshape national identity.

Frustration over foreign entities impacting domestic laws has also been a significant theme in the United States. For instance, recent legislative actions in Texas demonstrate a commitment to safeguarding American legal principles by explicitly legislating against Sharia law within its judicial system. This move has sparked discussions about the necessity for immigrants to adopt the dominant culture, reinforcing the idea that those who are uncomfortable with American values should consider returning to their countries of origin.

The underlying message is clear: the majority culture should not be overshadowed by minority groups. Advocates for this perspective argue that the successful integration of immigrants hinges on their willingness to embrace the customs, traditions, and values of their new home. This approach is seen as a pathway to fostering social cohesion and a sense of belonging among all residents.

Critics of this viewpoint, however, argue that such a stance could lead to exclusion and discrimination, undermining the very principles of diversity and inclusion that both the United States and Canada hold dear. They contend that a more nuanced approach is necessary—one that allows for cultural exchange and mutual respect while still encouraging immigrants to engage with and contribute to the broader societal fabric.

As the debate continues, it is evident that the issue of immigration and integration will remain at the forefront of political and social discussions in both countries. The challenge lies in finding a balance that respects the contributions of immigrants while ensuring that the foundational values of the host nations are preserved.

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a tense encounter in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by a group of Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through the area. Eyewitnesses reported that, at first, there was concern for the man’s safety, with many onlookers fearing he might be mugged as he was encircled by the demonstrators.

Unlike previous incidents where vehicles have been halted by protesters, this situation took a different turn. The protesters allowed the man to pass, raising questions about the dynamics at play during the confrontation. As the man approached the group, he calmly rolled down his window, revealing a handgun.

The sight of the firearm prompted a swift reaction from the protesters, who quickly dispersed, allowing the man to continue on his way. This incident has ignited discussions about the appropriateness of the driver's response. Some argue that displaying a weapon escalated the situation unnecessarily, while others believe that it was a justified means of ensuring his safety in a potentially threatening environment.

This encounter highlights the complexities surrounding protests and interactions between demonstrators and drivers. The decision to brandish a weapon has raised eyebrows and sparked debate about the implications of such actions during times of heightened tension. 

As communities continue to grapple with issues of race and justice, this incident serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of protests and the varying responses they elicit from individuals involved. The question remains: would it have been more appropriate for the man to simply drive through without displaying the handgun, or was his reaction a necessary measure to protect himself?

As discussions continue, the community reflects on the broader implications of this encounter, considering how similar situations might unfold in the future and what measures individuals might take when faced with unexpected confrontations during protests.",-18.0,-10.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,345.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.028985507246376812
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago environmentalists are under fire for what critics describe as blatant hypocrisy in their stance on significant urban development projects. The controversy centers around the environmental community's selective support for initiatives, which appears to waver when personal interests become involved.

In a striking contrast, local environmentalists vehemently opposed George Lucas's proposed museum, which aimed to occupy a parking lot. However, these same advocates have rallied behind the Obama Presidential Center, despite the project's environmental implications. The center's construction is set to result in the destruction of trees and grass in the historically significant Jackson Park, raising questions about the consistency of the environmentalists' values.

Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly endorsed the Obama center, a decision that has sparked outrage among those who prioritize environmental preservation. Critics argue that this endorsement reflects a troubling bias and highlights the perceived political hypocrisy within the environmental movement.

The article asserts that Leftists tend to champion various causes until the consequences of those causes directly impact their own preferences or interests. This pattern of selective advocacy raises concerns about the integrity of environmentalists' commitments to ecological preservation. 

As the debate continues, many are left questioning the motivations behind the environmentalists' support for the Obama center while opposing the Lucas museum. The juxtaposition of these projects has ignited a conversation about the true priorities of Chicago's environmental advocates and whether their actions align with their professed values.",3.0,0.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,280.0,0.0,0.0

At one point McChrystal was called into the Oval Office and he knew his Army career was about to be over.

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

In a dramatic turn of events, General Stanley McChrystal, the former Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has resigned following a contentious meeting with President Barack Obama. The meeting, held in the Oval Office, came after a series of frequent disagreements between McChrystal and the Commander-in-Chief regarding the ongoing war efforts.

As McChrystal entered the meeting, he anticipated that it would mark the end of his Army career. During the discussion, President Obama accused McChrystal of lacking political support, a claim that sparked a heated exchange. McChrystal firmly responded, asserting that his duty was to support Obama in his role as Commander-in-Chief, rather than as a politician. This declaration led to McChrystal submitting his resignation, a decision that underscored the growing rift between military leadership and the Obama administration.

The meeting took a pointed turn when Obama, known for his complicated relationship with military personnel, made a parting remark suggesting that McChrystal would celebrate his death. In a display of his commitment to honor, McChrystal saluted the President and countered with a striking response, declaring that he would not stand in line to pee on Obama's grave. This comment highlighted McChrystal’s dedication to his principles and respect for others, even amid personal and professional disagreements.

Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place.

These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA – Recent riots in Charlotte have drawn significant attention as investigations reveal that a substantial portion of the individuals involved were not local residents. Reports indicate that at least 70% of the rioters were identified as coming from out of state, raising questions about the motivations and organization behind the unrest.

Authorities have noted that many of the rioters possessed out-of-state identification, suggesting a level of premeditation and planning that goes beyond spontaneous protest. The head of the police union in Charlotte characterized these individuals as ""professional criminals,"" implying that their presence was not merely coincidental but rather a calculated effort to disrupt the community.

These developments have led to a growing narrative that groups such as Black Lives Matter may be orchestrating these events by busing in outside radicals to instigate violence. This claim has sparked heated debates about the nature of the protests and the intentions of those involved, with critics arguing that such actions undermine the legitimate grievances expressed by local activists.

In stark contrast, nearby Tulsa has experienced a different response to similar tensions. Protests in Tulsa have remained largely peaceful, despite facing threats of violence. Local sentiment towards Black Lives Matter appears to be less sympathetic, which may have played a role in keeping the peace. The situation was further diffused when a police officer involved in a controversial shooting was charged with manslaughter, a move that many believe helped to alleviate rising tensions in the community.

The unrest in Charlotte, however, has not been as easily contained. Observers suggest that the city has a pre-existing, active Black Lives Matter presence that may have contributed to the intensity of the protests. Some argue that the ultimate goal of these demonstrations is to create chaos and promote a revolutionary agenda, which raises concerns about the long-term implications for community relations and public safety.

As investigations continue, the focus remains on understanding the dynamics at play in Charlotte. The influx of out-of-state rioters, combined with the allegations of organized planning, has led to a climate of suspicion and unrest. Local leaders are grappling with how to address these challenges while also acknowledging the legitimate concerns of their constituents.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding protests and social movements in America today. While many individuals are motivated by a desire for justice and reform, the presence of outside agitators can complicate the narrative and shift the focus away from the original issues at hand. 

As the community seeks to heal and move forward, the conversations surrounding these events will likely continue to evolve. The contrasting experiences of Charlotte and Tulsa highlight the varying responses to social movements across the country, emphasizing the need for local engagement and understanding in addressing the root causes of unrest.

In conclusion, the riots in Charlotte have raised important questions about organization, motivation, and the role of external influences in social movements. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how these factors will shape the future of protests and community relations in the region. The situation underscores the ongoing struggle for justice and the complexities that come with advocating for change in a divided society.",-17.0,-25.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,597.0,-1.0869565217391304,-0.04187604690117253
Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

Claims have surfaced suggesting that Clinton suffers from serious health problems, including potential neurological diseases. The discourse surrounding her health intensified following her collapse on September 11th, prompting media outlets to shift their focus to these alarming issues.

Adding to the intrigue, expert Clif Hite has proposed a controversial theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and been replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this theory would mark one of the most significant cover-ups in American political history.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right?

In a recent revelation by Discover the Networks, it has come to light that 187 groups funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros are actively targeting presidential candidates whose values oppose their own. Among these organizations is the newly established Common Defense PAC, which is specifically focused on attacking former President Donald Trump.

Common Defense PAC presents itself as an organization dedicated to protecting the rights of every American, particularly those of veterans. However, its primary mission appears to be a concerted effort to oppose Trump. The PAC’s leadership team is composed of military veterans, yet it notably lacks publicly available contact information for these individuals, raising questions about transparency and accountability.

The PAC has been proactive in disseminating anti-Trump materials, often sharing videos and content from other Soros-funded political action committees (PACs). This strategy aims to amplify their message and garner support from a broader audience. A key element of their campaign is the promotion of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which has gained traction and is also backed by MoveOn.org, a prominent progressive advocacy group.

MoveOn.org's Political Action arm has actively advertised the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag, helping to spread awareness of the campaign. In addition to this social media initiative, Common Defense PAC is involved in a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump. This campaign has reached over 4.5 million people, showcasing the potential impact of coordinated online efforts. The initiative has garnered celebrity support, with notable figures like Mark Ruffalo and Van Jones lending their voices to the cause, further enhancing its visibility.

The collaboration between Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org has also manifested in real-world actions, including a protest that aimed to urge Senator John McCain to disavow Trump. This partnership highlights a strategic alliance between the PAC and established progressive organizations, reinforcing the notion that the opposition to Trump is not limited to a single entity but is part of a larger, organized movement.

Despite the PAC's ambitious goals and public-facing initiatives, its financial disclosures raise concerns. According to Common Defense PAC's July quarterly filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the organization has reported only one donor: Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This limited financial backing may cast doubt on the PAC's ability to sustain its operations and effectively challenge a former president with significant resources.

At the helm of Common Defense PAC is Director Perry O’Brien, a longtime left-wing activist and conscientious objector who served in Afghanistan. O’Brien's background as a conscientious objector may complicate the PAC's narrative of representing veterans, as it raises questions about the legitimacy of an organization claiming to advocate for veterans while primarily being led by someone with a non-combatant status. O’Brien has been active in organizing petitions through MoveOn.org, specifically targeting Trump and his perceived attacks on veterans, further solidifying his role as a key figure in the anti-Trump narrative.

Critics of Common Defense PAC have pointed out the incongruity of its leadership structure, questioning how effectively it can represent the interests of veterans when it is predominantly guided by a conscientious objector. This discrepancy may lead to skepticism among potential supporters who are veterans themselves, as they seek to align with an organization that genuinely reflects their experiences and concerns.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Common Defense PAC’s efforts to mobilize opposition against Trump signal a growing trend of organized resistance among groups funded by Soros. With its focus on veterans' rights and its strategic partnerships, the PAC is poised to play a significant role in the upcoming electoral cycle. However, the effectiveness of its campaigns and the authenticity of its leadership will likely remain subjects of scrutiny as the organization navigates the complex dynamics of American politics.",8.0,27.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,709.0,1.08,0.0380818053596615

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has revealed that the Obama administration allocated over $770 million in taxpayer funds for the renovation of mosques overseas. This significant expenditure has sparked a wave of controversy and concern regarding the implications of U.S. foreign aid, particularly in relation to potential support for terror-affiliated groups.

Critics of the funding argue that this spending comes at a time when the United States is grappling with its own economic challenges. With many Americans facing unemployment and financial struggles, the decision to invest taxpayer money in refurbishing religious buildings in foreign countries has drawn ire from various taxpayer advocacy groups. These advocates express outrage over what they perceive as a misallocation of funds, especially when domestic issues remain unaddressed.

The rationale behind the funding, as provided by the State Department, is rooted in efforts to foster relationships with Islamic leaders. Officials argue that these renovations are part of a broader strategy to combat extremism and promote peace through engagement with influential figures in the Islamic community. However, this justification has done little to quell the growing dissent among those who believe that U.S. wealth is being redistributed to Islamic countries at the expense of American taxpayers.

The CBS report raises critical questions about the long-term implications of such financial commitments. Some analysts suggest that the significant investment in overseas mosque renovations could influence the domestic demographic and political landscape in the United States. As funds are directed toward foreign religious institutions, there are concerns about the potential impact on U.S. interests and the prioritization of domestic needs.

Despite the controversy, the State Department has remained largely silent on the issue. When approached for comment, officials declined to provide an interview, opting instead to issue a written statement. This lack of engagement has further fueled skepticism regarding the motivations behind the funding and the overall strategy of U.S. foreign aid.

As the investigation continues to unfold, the implications of the Obama administration’s spending practices are becoming increasingly apparent. With taxpayer advocates and critics calling for greater transparency and accountability, the debate surrounding the allocation of foreign aid remains a contentious topic. The revelations from the CBS investigation are likely to resonate with a public already wary of government spending, particularly in light of pressing domestic issues.

In summary, the CBS investigation highlights a significant expenditure of taxpayer money by the Obama administration to renovate mosques overseas, raising concerns about the potential support of terror-affiliated groups and the implications for domestic economic challenges. The State Department’s defense of the funding as a means to combat extremism has not alleviated the concerns of critics who argue that such spending is misdirected and could have far-reaching consequences for the United States. As the conversation surrounding foreign aid and its impact on domestic priorities continues, the need for transparency and accountability in government spending has never been more critical.",-13.0,-7.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,534.0,-0.35,-0.013108614232209739

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

In a bold response to the rising threat of terrorism, the Marine Corps has launched a nationwide billboard campaign aimed at confronting the fear and propaganda tactics employed by ISIS and similar groups. These organizations have long used intimidation to coerce individuals into converting to Islam, labeling those who refuse as infidels and subjecting them to death threats and targeted hit lists.

The Marine Corps' initiative comes on the heels of an increase in terrorist attacks across the United States over the past year. By placing billboards in prominent locations, the Marines are sending a clear message: they are prepared to confront and combat the threats posed by terrorists. This campaign is designed to undermine the terrorists' agenda of instilling fear in the hearts of Americans.

Marines are taking a stand, demonstrating that they are not intimidated by being placed on terrorist hit lists. Instead, they embrace the challenge, showcasing their readiness to fight back against those who seek to sow discord and fear. The billboards symbolize a commitment to self-defense and a refusal to allow fear to dictate the actions of American citizens.

However, the campaign has not been without its critics. Some liberals argue that the message prioritizes the protection of terrorists over the safety of American citizens. They contend that the focus should be on de-escalation and dialogue rather than a militaristic approach that could further polarize the situation.

Despite the criticism, the Marine Corps remains steadfast in its mission. The billboards serve not only as a reminder of the Marines' readiness but also as a rallying cry for Americans to reject the narrative of fear propagated by terrorist organizations. The message is clear: fearlessness is a crucial component in the fight against terrorism, and it is through such resolve that these threats can be defeated.

As the campaign continues to roll out, the Marine Corps stands united in its declaration: the agenda of ISIS and similar groups is one that has been defeated. By fostering an environment of strength and resilience, the Marines aim to inspire confidence among the public and reinforce the idea that terrorism will not prevail in the face of unwavering determination.

In a landscape where fear can often dictate responses, the Marines' initiative serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of courage and readiness. As the billboards dot the American landscape, they symbolize not only a commitment to confront terrorism but also a collective stand against the fear that these groups seek to instill. The message is clear: the fight against terrorism is one that the Marines are prepared to lead, and they will not back down in the face of adversity.",-53.0,-27.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,495.0,-1.4210526315789473,-0.05454545454545454

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has descended into chaos as rioting has severely impacted the city, leading to widespread looting and property damage. The unrest has prompted North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency, mobilizing the National Guard in an effort to restore order.

The violence erupted unexpectedly, with businesses targeted and windows smashed, leaving many local establishments devastated. In response to the escalating situation, state officials have taken a hardline stance against those participating in the riots. Individuals caught engaging in rioting, looting, or any form of violence will face severe consequences, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits.

The measures extend beyond adults; minor children involved in violent acts will also face the same penalties. In a concerning twist, parents of these minors may find themselves facing repercussions as well, including the potential loss of state benefits. This initiative aims to hold families accountable for the actions of their children, with city official Wilson Stewart emphasizing the importance of parental responsibility during a press conference.

Stewart's remarks highlight a growing concern among officials regarding the youth's involvement in the unrest. Reports indicate that many of those detained during the riots were high school students, prompting a plea for parents to closely monitor their children's whereabouts. The city is urging families to take an active role in ensuring their children are not swept up in the violence that has gripped Charlotte.

To further combat the unrest, city officials have implemented a mandatory curfew aimed at restoring peace and order. The curfew is intended to limit the movement of individuals during the evening hours, reducing the chances of further riots and violence. Officials hope that this measure will help to quell the unrest and allow the community to begin the process of healing.

As the situation continues to unfold, the city of Charlotte is grappling with the aftermath of the riots. The destruction of property and the emotional toll on the community have left many residents shaken. Local leaders are calling for unity and resilience in the face of adversity, urging citizens to come together to rebuild their city.

The declaration of a state of emergency and the involvement of the National Guard signal the seriousness of the situation. Officials are working diligently to restore order and provide safety for the citizens of Charlotte. However, the long-term effects of the riots, particularly on youth involvement and community trust, will take time to address.

As Charlotte navigates this turbulent period, the focus remains on restoring peace and ensuring that such violence does not happen again. The community is left to ponder the underlying issues that led to the unrest, as well as the steps necessary to prevent future occurrences. With strong measures in place, officials hope to guide Charlotte toward a more stable and united future.",-33.0,-23.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,534.0,-1.0,-0.04307116104868914

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

The ongoing FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal has come under fire, with significant criticism directed at FBI Director James Comey. As the investigation unfolds, pressure is mounting for Comey to resign, raising questions about the integrity of the inquiry and the decisions made throughout the process.

Comey's controversial decision to grant immunity to Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, has drawn particular scrutiny. Reports suggest that Mills allegedly refused to cooperate with investigators by not providing her computer for examination, further complicating the investigation's credibility. Critics argue that such actions undermine the seriousness of the probe and fuel speculation about the motivations behind Comey’s choices.

In a move that could have far-reaching implications for Comey, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28 to assess his conduct during the investigation. This hearing represents a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over Comey’s leadership and the FBI's handling of the case. 

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has been vocal in his criticism, calling for Comey’s resignation and questioning his fitness for office. DiGenova has labeled the investigation as improperly conducted, asserting that it was merely a “protected investigation” rather than a genuine inquiry into wrongdoing. His comments reflect a growing sentiment among some lawmakers and legal experts who believe that the investigation has not been handled with the necessary rigor.

Moreover, DiGenova has urged Congress to take action by holding hearings to further investigate Comey’s decisions and the overall handling of the email scandal. This call for additional scrutiny highlights the ongoing political fallout from the investigation, which has become a focal point in discussions about accountability and transparency within governmental agencies.

Compounding the challenges facing Comey, he has been issued a subpoena by Congress for failing to provide requested documents related to the email scandal. This development adds another layer of complexity to his situation, as lawmakers seek to obtain information that they believe is crucial for understanding the full scope of the investigation and Comey’s actions.

As the investigation continues, questions linger about Comey’s loyalty to Clinton and the potential consequences he may face as a result. The implications of this inquiry extend beyond Comey himself, as it raises broader concerns about the FBI's role in high-profile political investigations and the potential for perceived bias.

The unfolding events surrounding the FBI investigation into Clinton's email practices are likely to remain a contentious topic in the coming weeks, especially with the scheduled hearing on the horizon. As lawmakers and the public await further developments, the pressure on Comey intensifies, leaving many to wonder about the future of the investigation and its impact on the political landscape.",-17.0,-28.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,523.0,-1.5555555555555556,-0.05353728489483748

In a troubling intersection of politics and ethics, Saudi Arabia has emerged as a significant donor to Hillary Clinton's campaign, reportedly funding 20% of it. This financial support raises critical questions about the implications of such contributions, especially in light of Saudi Arabia's controversial actions both domestically and internationally.

The U.S. has long maintained a complex relationship with Saudi Arabia, often prioritizing strategic interests over moral considerations. This ongoing support is increasingly scrutinized, particularly given the historical context surrounding the 9/11 attacks, where a substantial number of the terrorists were Saudi nationals, including members of the notorious Bin Laden family. The fact that many of these individuals hailed from the same country that receives extensive backing from the U.S. government underscores a troubling contradiction in American foreign policy.

Moreover, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the global crisis of human trafficking cannot be overlooked. The nation has been accused of publicly auctioning off sex slaves captured by ISIS, a practice that has seen buyers from various nationalities, including Westerners. This horrific reality highlights the extent of the human rights violations occurring within the context of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, where the Islamic State has been systematically trafficking sex slaves. The primary victims of this abhorrent trade are Yazidi girls and other non-Muslim women, who are subjected to unimaginable horrors.

The implications of Saudi Arabia's actions extend beyond its borders, as the country plays a significant role in perpetuating the very issues that many politicians claim to oppose. The trafficking of women and the abuse of human rights under the guise of religious extremism are stark reminders of the urgent need for accountability. The article calls for a cessation of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, urging politicians to reevaluate their ties with a nation that stands accused of facilitating such egregious violations.

As the U.S. continues to support Saudi Arabia, the question arises: how can politicians, particularly those like Hillary Clinton, accept donations from a country with such a troubling track record? The author expresses a profound distrust in politicians who prioritize financial backing over ethical considerations, particularly in light of the ongoing human trafficking and abuse occurring under ISIS and Saudi involvement. The acceptance of funds from a nation implicated in the trafficking of human beings raises serious ethical concerns and calls into question the integrity of those who receive such support.

The need for a reevaluation of U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia is more pressing than ever. The article emphasizes that a clear stance against human trafficking and abuse must be taken, which includes holding accountable not only the perpetrators but also those who enable such actions through financial and military support. It is imperative that politicians recognize the implications of their alliances and the potential consequences of accepting contributions from nations involved in human rights violations.

In conclusion, the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia is fraught with contradictions that demand attention. As the nation grapples with its moral obligations on the global stage, the influence of significant donors like Saudi Arabia must be critically examined. The call for an end to arms sales and a distancing from Saudi interests is not merely a political stance; it is a necessary step toward addressing the broader issues of human trafficking and abuse that continue to plague the region. The time has come for politicians to prioritize ethical considerations over financial gain, ensuring that their actions align with the values they profess to uphold.",-30.0,-24.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,647.0,-1.0434782608695652,-0.03709428129829984
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the election season unfolded with intense exchanges between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump, setting the stage for a contentious political battle. The debate, moderated by Lester Holt, was characterized by sharp disagreements and pointed questions, particularly concerning foreign policy and the Iraq War.

Criticism arose against Holt for his frequent interruptions of Trump, which many viewed as an attempt to ""fact-check"" the Republican candidate. However, these interventions were often deemed inaccurate, leading to further scrutiny of the moderator's role during the debate. One of the most contentious moments came when Holt asserted that Trump had supported the Iraq War, a claim that Trump vehemently denied. Despite the heated exchange, Holt did not extend the same line of questioning to Clinton regarding her own vote in favor of the war, a decision that has been a focal point of criticism throughout her campaign.

Following the debate, an interview with Neil Cavuto aired, showcasing Trump's reservations about the decision to invade Iraq. In this interview, Trump expressed uncertainty about the war, suggesting that the United States should have waited for the United Nations to take a lead on the situation. This stance contrasts sharply with Holt’s assertion during the debate, highlighting a potential area of miscommunication regarding Trump’s foreign policy views.

The article raises concerns about the moderator's focus, suggesting that Holt should have questioned Clinton about her authorization of the war, rather than concentrating solely on Trump's alleged support. This imbalance in questioning has led to wider discussions about media bias and the responsibilities of debate moderators in presenting a fair platform for both candidates.

In the wake of the debate, mainstream media outlets have faced criticism for their portrayal of Trump, with many commentators arguing that there is a concerted effort to tarnish his reputation. Despite this, Trump was noted for his ability to effectively stand up to both Clinton and the media during the debate, asserting his positions with confidence and challenging the narratives presented by his opponents.

As the election season progresses, the dynamics established in this first debate are likely to influence voter perceptions and campaign strategies. With both candidates showcasing their strengths and weaknesses, the road ahead promises to be as contentious as the debate itself. The scrutiny of media practices and the role of moderators will undoubtedly remain a topic of discussion as the election unfolds.",-9.0,-9.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,463.0,-0.5625,-0.019438444924406047
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

In recent discussions surrounding the controversial Birther movement, a provocative question has emerged: Could its origins implicate none other than Barack Obama himself? This speculation stems from a 2004 article published by Breitbart that labeled Obama as ""Kenyan-born"" while he was campaigning for the Illinois Senate seat. The article not only raised eyebrows but also ignited a firestorm of debate about the implications of such claims on Obama's legitimacy as a candidate.

As the race unfolded, Obama found himself in a favorable position after his rival, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a scandal. This turn of events allowed Obama to gain a clear lead, further intensifying the scrutiny of his background and the validity of his American birth. Interestingly, throughout this period, Obama never publicly refuted the assertion that he was born in Kenya, leaving many to speculate on the authenticity of his origins.

Adding fuel to the fire, a promotional booklet from Obama's literary agency, dating back to 1991, described him as ""born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii."" This document was shared among publishing industry colleagues and included biographies of various authors, raising questions about the accuracy of such a statement. Why would a literary agency promote Obama in this manner if it were untrue? The implications of this description have led to further inquiries into the narrative surrounding Obama’s birthplace.

The crux of the debate lies in the apparent contradiction between the claims of Obama being born in America and the assertion of him being Kenyan-born. If Obama's American birth is indeed valid, then the Kenyan-born claim must be a fabrication. Conversely, if the latter is true, it raises serious questions about the legitimacy of his presidency and identity. This duality presents a complex picture, suggesting potential manipulation of his narrative for personal gain.

The discussions surrounding the Birther movement have often been tinged with racial undertones, leading to accusations of racism against those who perpetuate the claims. The movement's origins and its implications for Obama’s identity as a Black man in America cannot be overlooked. As the conversation continues, it is essential to critically examine the motivations behind such claims and the broader societal implications they carry.

In light of these revelations and ongoing debates, the Birther movement remains a contentious chapter in American political history, one that intertwines issues of race, identity, and the quest for legitimacy in the public sphere. The context of these claims, as detailed in the original Breitbart article, continues to shape the narrative surrounding Obama and his legacy.",-18.0,-5.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,492.0,-0.25,-0.01016260162601626
Fake_90-Webpage,People Noticed Something Odd About Hillary's Outfit,"

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

I think we all know why #TrumpWon pic.twitter.com/nwZRxvkX81 — USA For Trump 2016 (@USAforTrump2016) September 27, 2016

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In the wake of the recent debate, Hillary Clinton's performance has ignited a flurry of discussions and speculations, particularly regarding her demeanor and the absence of her typical coughs. Observers noted a significant departure from her past debate appearances, as Clinton did not exhibit her usual need for water, which some considered unusual and noteworthy.

Social media platforms became a hotbed of theories and debates, particularly surrounding a flesh-colored device that was visible in Clinton's ear during the event. This has led to rampant speculation among users, who questioned whether the object was an earpiece intended for receiving prompts or merely a fashion accessory. Some commentators suggested that it could be a trick of light or even a puffy zipper from her outfit, while others humorously proposed that it might be a ""Cough prevention machine,"" playing on Clinton's past struggles with coughs during public appearances.

Clinton's campaign has responded to these speculations by firmly denying the presence of any earpiece. Campaign representatives attributed the appearance of the device to reflections caused by the television lights, attempting to quell the rising tide of conspiracy theories.

Adding fuel to the fire, an email from Clinton to her aide Huma Abedin, which was revealed by WikiLeaks, has raised further questions regarding the use of an earpiece. This disclosure has led to increased scrutiny and debate among political analysts and the public alike, as they ponder the implications of such a device in a debate setting.

Criticism has also come from social media users, with one notable comment from Twitter user Woods, who suggested that Clinton relies on external assistance during her speeches. This remark encapsulated a broader sentiment among some observers who feel that Clinton's debate preparation may not be entirely her own.

As discussions continue, the question remains: Was the device in Clinton's ear a hearing aid, a reflection of the lighting, or something else entirely? With no conclusive evidence presented, the debate surrounding the issue persists, leaving many to wonder about the implications of such devices in political discourse.

The controversy highlights the intense scrutiny that candidates face during public appearances, where every detail can become the subject of speculation and debate. As the political landscape evolves, the focus on candidates' performances and the tools they utilize in their communication will likely remain a point of contention.

In the end, while Clinton's debate performance may have been marked by a lack of coughing and a readiness with answers, the lingering questions about the device in her ear serve as a reminder of the complexities and challenges faced by public figures in the age of social media. The discourse surrounding the debate will undoubtedly continue as both supporters and critics seek to interpret the implications of Clinton's performance and the technologies that may or may not have played a role in it.",-5.0,-15.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,536.0,-0.8823529411764706,-0.027985074626865673
