Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Former President Bill Clinton recently made headlines with a statement regarding donors to the Clinton Foundation, which has reignited discussions surrounding accusations of ""pay to play"" politics. This phrase has been frequently associated with the foundation, particularly in light of criticisms from political opponents, including Donald Trump.

In an interview with NPR, Clinton acknowledged that while donors to the foundation may seek favors, he emphasized that such requests do not guarantee any favors will be granted. He firmly stated that there is no evidence supporting the claim that the foundation operates under a ""pay to play"" model. This assertion aims to clarify the nature of interactions between the foundation and its donors, stressing that the mere act of asking does not equate to receiving special treatment.

However, the controversy is far from settled. Leaked emails have revealed that certain Clinton Foundation donors were granted meetings with influential figures, while others reportedly faced denial. Despite these revelations, Clinton maintains that there is no concrete evidence to suggest that any favors were exchanged for donations. The situation highlights a complex dynamic in which perceptions may differ from the facts presented.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump has faced his own scrutiny regarding his charitable activities. Since 2008, Trump has not made any personal donations to his own foundation, raising questions about his commitment to philanthropy. Furthermore, allegations have surfaced claiming that Trump misused funds from his charity for personal purchases, casting a shadow over his philanthropic endeavors.

The scrutiny of Trump's charitable practices has led to an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The inquiry aims to determine whether the Trump Foundation has engaged in any impropriety under charity laws. This ongoing investigation adds another layer of complexity to the already contentious political landscape, as both candidates navigate the implications of their respective foundations.

Amid these controversies, Media Matters has pointed out a perceived double standard in media coverage of the two candidates. The organization argues that the media has devoted significantly more attention to Hillary Clinton's health issues than to the controversies surrounding Trump's foundation. This perceived bias in coverage is believed to be impacting Clinton's campaign negatively while inadvertently benefiting Trump.

The implications of this uneven media focus are significant, as public perception is heavily influenced by the narratives presented in the news. While Clinton's foundation has faced intense scrutiny, Trump's charitable actions and the ongoing investigation into his foundation have not received the same level of attention. This discrepancy raises questions about the fairness of media reporting and its potential influence on the electoral process.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the narratives surrounding both candidates will continue to evolve. Clinton's comments about foundation donors and the subsequent backlash underscore the challenges she faces in addressing persistent allegations. Meanwhile, Trump's charitable controversies remain a focal point of scrutiny, with the New York Attorney General's investigation looming over his campaign.

The interplay between these issues highlights the broader conversation about transparency and accountability in political philanthropy. Voters are increasingly concerned about the integrity of charitable organizations and the potential for conflicts of interest. As both candidates grapple with their respective foundations' legacies, the electorate is left to ponder the implications for their candidacies.

In conclusion, the recent statements by Bill Clinton regarding the Clinton Foundation have reignited discussions about the complex relationship between philanthropy and politics. While Clinton seeks to distance himself from accusations of ""pay to play,"" the scrutiny surrounding both him and Trump underscores the challenges facing candidates in an increasingly polarized political environment. As the election draws nearer, the impact of these controversies on voter perception and campaign dynamics remains to be seen.",6.0,-1.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,697.0,-0.03333333333333333,-0.0014347202295552368
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A recently drafted congressional report has ignited a firestorm of controversy surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a prominent initiative of the Clinton Foundation. The report alleges that CHAI distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, which could potentially increase morbidity and mortality risks for patients relying on these critical medications. Titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” the report was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, and has raised significant concerns about the implications for both public health and the Clinton Foundation's reputation.

The Clinton Health Access Initiative, established with the goal of aiding AIDS victims, has been a hallmark of Bill Clinton's post-presidential philanthropic efforts. However, the report scrutinizes the relationship between the initiative and Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, a key distributor of HIV/AIDS drugs. The implications of this relationship are further complicated by the actions of Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower and former Ranbaxy employee, who played a pivotal role in enabling a U.S. lawsuit against the company for its quality control failures.

In 2013, Ranbaxy pleaded guilty to multiple criminal charges related to the distribution of substandard medications, resulting in a substantial $500 million fine imposed by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ's findings indicated that Ranbaxy's diluted drugs posed increased risks for patients, raising alarms about the potential impact on AIDS patients who depended on these medications for their survival.

Rep. Blackburn's report questions the extent of harm caused by CHAI’s distribution of these potentially substandard drugs, suggesting that the initiative may have inadvertently jeopardized the health of vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa. The scrutiny of CHAI comes at a politically sensitive time, as the report could have significant implications for the Clinton Foundation, particularly amid Hillary Clinton's ongoing presidential campaign.

In an effort to bring these concerns to light, Blackburn submitted the report to both the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State, where Hillary Clinton served as secretary. The report highlights the Clinton Foundation's continued support for Ranbaxy despite the company's troubling history of poor quality control and violations of FDA regulations.

The issues surrounding Ranbaxy are not new; the World Health Organization reported irregularities with the company's drugs as far back as 2004. Furthermore, in 2006, the FDA issued a warning letter to Ranbaxy regarding its quality control issues, underscoring the long-standing concerns about the safety and efficacy of its products. Despite these warnings, CHAI has continued to distribute Ranbaxy's HIV/AIDS medications abroad, raising questions about the initiative's commitment to patient safety.

In a statement made in 2013, Bill Clinton praised Ranbaxy, asserting that the company’s drugs had saved millions of lives. However, this endorsement has come under renewed scrutiny in light of the findings presented in Blackburn's report. Dinesh Thakur, who has transitioned from a whistleblower to a public health activist, has criticized the Clinton Foundation for allegedly ignoring his outreach regarding the quality of the drugs being distributed. Thakur's allegations add a layer of complexity to the ongoing discussion about the efficacy of CHAI's initiatives and the ethical implications of its partnerships.

Although CHAI officially separated from the Clinton Foundation in 2010, the report notes that there remains significant overlap in leadership and coordination between the two entities. This connection raises further questions about accountability and oversight, particularly as the congressional study suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards through an executive order issued in 2000.

CHAI began distributing generic HIV drugs from several foreign manufacturers, including Ranbaxy, in 2003, which coincided with a broader push to make antiretroviral therapies more accessible to people living with HIV/AIDS in developing countries. While the initiative aimed to expand access to life-saving medications, the recent allegations cast a shadow over the integrity of these efforts.

The report also delves into potential corruption and how the program may have financially benefited the Clinton Foundation. The relationships that the foundation has cultivated with Indian-American businessmen involved in the American Indian Foundation, which was co-founded by Clinton, are also scrutinized. These connections raise ethical concerns about the motivations behind the partnerships and whether they prioritized profit over patient welfare.

Rep. Blackburn expressed particular concern over the emotional toll that these issues may have on healthcare workers and patients who have placed their trust in the Clinton Foundation's initiatives. She highlighted the ""false hopes"" created by the foundation, suggesting that the distribution of potentially substandard medications could lead to devastating consequences for those who rely on them for their health and well-being.

As the report continues to circulate and garner attention, it remains to be seen how the Clinton Foundation will respond to these allegations and what implications they may have for future initiatives aimed at combating HIV/AIDS. The findings of this congressional study not only raise questions about the efficacy of CHAI's drug distribution practices but also challenge the narrative surrounding the Clinton Foundation's philanthropic efforts in global health.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn presents serious allegations against the Clinton Health Access Initiative regarding its distribution of HIV/AIDS drugs. The implications of these findings extend beyond the realm of public health, potentially impacting the reputation of the Clinton Foundation and its ongoing initiatives. As the political landscape evolves, the scrutiny surrounding CHAI may continue to grow, prompting further investigation and dialogue about the intersection of philanthropy, public health, and accountability.",-6.0,2.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1022.0,0.06060606060606061,0.0019569471624266144
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a surprising turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van after participating in the 9-11 ceremony in New York City. This incident has raised significant concerns regarding her health and ability to engage in the upcoming political landscape, particularly as the presidential election draws near.

Following her collapse, Clinton made a notable appearance at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment. Observers were quick to comment on her changed appearance, as she looked lighter, more vibrant, and sported a distinctly different nose compared to her usual features. Described as a Roman-type nose, this new facial characteristic stands in stark contrast to the real Hillary's traditional Nordic nose. Such a transformation has led to rampant speculation about the authenticity of the individual seen in Chelsea’s apartment.

Further fueling the rumors, the stand-in version of Clinton appears younger and notably lacks a mole that the real Hillary has above her lip. This absence has led many to question the legitimacy of the person who has stepped into the public eye. Given these discrepancies, some observers are suggesting that this clone or stand-in may handle most of Clinton's public appearances leading up to the election, a decision driven by concerns over her health.

As the political climate heats up, questions are being raised about Hillary Clinton's capability to participate in the upcoming debates against Donald Trump. The stakes are high, and the public is left wondering whether the real Hillary will be able to engage effectively in the crucial discussions that could shape the future of the election. The implications of her health on her performance are significant, and many are calling for transparency regarding her condition.

Observers are being advised to be vigilant for signs of the clone during public appearances. Notable changes in appearance or behavior could serve as indicators that the individual speaking or engaging with the public is not the real Hillary Clinton. This situation has sparked a mixture of concern and curiosity among the electorate, as they grapple with the prospect of a potential figurehead leading the Clinton administration.

The speculation surrounding the possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may remain unseen if elected is particularly striking. If the clone were to conduct all public duties, it raises profound questions about the nature of leadership and authenticity in politics. Would the real Hillary have any involvement in her administration, or would she take a backseat while a stand-in assumes the responsibilities of public engagement?

The author draws parallels to past speculations regarding President Obama, highlighting the unique circumstances that could arise if a Clinton administration were to be led by a figurehead. The notion of a leader being physically absent from the public sphere while a clone or stand-in manages the duties of office is unprecedented and raises ethical considerations about transparency and representation in governance.

As the election approaches, the situation remains fluid, and the public's reaction to these developments will likely influence the political narrative. Concerns over health, authenticity, and the integrity of political leadership are at the forefront of discussions surrounding Hillary Clinton's candidacy.

The views expressed in this article represent the author’s perspective and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. As the political landscape continues to evolve, it is essential for voters to remain informed and engaged, questioning the realities behind the figures they choose to support. The unfolding drama surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and public appearances may well become a defining aspect of the upcoming election cycle.",8.0,26.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,658.0,1.04,0.03951367781155015
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In the realm of American politics, few figures have sparked as much debate and division as Donald Trump. His remarks on immigration and terrorism have drawn sharp criticism and raised serious concerns regarding their implications for civil rights and social cohesion in the United States. This article delves into Trump's controversial proposals and statements, which have become a focal point in the ongoing national discourse.

Trump has made headlines with his audacious assertions about immigration, particularly his proposal for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In his rhetoric, he has referred to immigrants from south of the border as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers,"" framing a narrative that positions them as threats to American society. This inflammatory language not only stokes fear but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes that can lead to increased discrimination against immigrant communities.

Furthermore, Trump has suggested the creation of a national registry for Muslims, proposing the implementation of identification badges for this religious group. Such measures draw troubling parallels to historical actions taken against Jews during the Holocaust, raising alarms among civil rights advocates who fear the potential for systemic discrimination and violations of constitutional rights.

The former president's approach to terrorism is equally contentious. Trump has advocated for extreme measures, including targeting the families of terrorists. This stance raises ethical questions about accountability and the potential for collective punishment, which is generally condemned under international law. His Senior Communications Advisor has indicated that Trump's focus is less on combating terrorism itself and more on dismantling the narratives constructed by former President Obama and Hillary Clinton. This approach suggests a prioritization of political rivalry over effective counter-terrorism strategies.

Criticism of the previous administration's immigration policies is a recurring theme in Trump's rhetoric. He has pointed to an increase in immigrants from ""dangerous countries"" and the rise in Syrian refugees during Obama's presidency. Trump claims these policies put American citizens at risk, framing the influx of refugees as a direct threat to national security. This narrative, however, overlooks the complexities of refugee situations and the rigorous vetting processes that are typically in place for individuals seeking asylum.

In his speeches, Trump has emphasized the need to ""destroy"" terrorists before they can inflict harm on U.S. citizens, positioning this as an existential threat to the nation and its core values. This framing not only heightens fear but also simplifies the multifaceted nature of terrorism and the various factors that contribute to it. By focusing solely on a militaristic approach to counter-terrorism, Trump risks alienating potential allies and undermining efforts to address the root causes of extremism.

Moreover, Trump's repeated assertions blaming Muslims for terrorist attacks have raised significant concerns about the implications for Muslim communities in the U.S. By suggesting that Muslims are not reporting suspicious activities, he implies a collective responsibility that unfairly stigmatizes an entire faith group. This rhetoric can lead to increased hostility and discrimination against Muslims, further polarizing an already divided society.

As discussions surrounding Trump's policies continue, questions arise about how he would define terrorism and the potential consequences for Muslims living in the U.S. The vagueness of such definitions can lead to arbitrary enforcement and violations of civil liberties, raising alarms among civil rights organizations and legal experts alike.

The article also highlights concerns regarding Trump's temperament and his willingness to resort to extreme measures, including the potential use of nuclear options. Critics argue that such an unstable nature poses a significant risk not only domestically but also on the global stage, where diplomatic relations and national security are at stake.

Recent events have underscored the complexities of terrorism in America. Notably, the attacks in New York and New Jersey were perpetrated by an American citizen, challenging the narrative that immigration is the primary source of domestic terrorism. This reality emphasizes the importance of upholding constitutional rights and recognizing that threats can emerge from within the country, regardless of immigration status.

In light of these contentious issues, the author expresses strong opposition to Trump's candidacy, urging voters to actively participate in the upcoming election. The call to action is rooted in the belief that a collective response is necessary to safeguard American values and protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of their background or beliefs.

As the nation approaches a pivotal moment in its political landscape, the implications of Trump's statements and policies will undoubtedly continue to resonate.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, promoting the concept of a One World Government.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Allegations of pay-to-play corruption have resurfaced regarding Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, prompting a vigorous defense from the Clinton campaign. In light of these accusations, the campaign has emphasized the foundation's positive contributions to global health and development, arguing that its work has significantly benefited communities worldwide.

However, critics have raised concerns about the foundation's financial practices, suggesting that it primarily serves as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates. This scrutiny is underscored by alarming statistics from the foundation's 2014 IRS filings. According to these documents, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants that year.

In 2014, the foundation's total expenditures reached approximately $91.3 million. Of this, less than $5.2 million was directed toward charitable causes. In stark contrast, the foundation spent a staggering $34.8 million on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, alongside $50.4 million on ""other expenses."" This allocation has raised eyebrows among critics, who argue that the financial structure of the foundation undermines its charitable mission.

The situation appears even more troubling when examining the foundation's charitable spending trends. Despite receiving an additional $30 million in 2014, the amount allocated to charitable initiatives decreased by 40% compared to the previous year, 2013. Furthermore, salaries and other expenses saw a notable increase of $5 million in 2014, further fueling skepticism about the foundation's priorities.

As these allegations continue to unfold, the Clinton Foundation's operations are under intense scrutiny. Critics assert that the foundation has become a mechanism for the Clintons to generate substantial income, casting doubt on its purported philanthropic endeavors. This narrative has the potential to impact public perception as the Clinton campaign moves forward.

In conclusion, while the Clinton campaign highlights the foundation's positive contributions, the financial data raises significant questions about its operational integrity. The ongoing debate over the Clinton Foundation underscores the complexities surrounding political donations and the intersection of philanthropy and personal gain.

Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

This event marked her first public appearance since a concerning incident at the 9-11 memorial in New York City, where she was seen convulsing and required assistance to enter her van. Initially, Clinton's campaign attributed the episode to heat, but subsequent reports indicated that the temperature in NYC was a mild 74 degrees at the time.

Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment, passing by multiple hospitals, which has sparked questions regarding the nature of her recovery. Observers have raised doubts about whether the rally in Greensboro was a genuine display of her campaign or if it was staged to project a sense of normalcy.

Adding to the controversy, a video from the rally has drawn scrutiny, with some viewers suggesting that the audience appeared inauthentic, raising further suspicions about the event's legitimacy. However, a separate C-Span video has been referenced to confirm the authenticity of the footage, leaving some questions unanswered. As the campaign continues, the implications of these incidents on Clinton's public image and voter confidence remain to be seen.",4.0,-1.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,223.0,-0.125,-0.004484304932735426
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the release date approaches for the satirical film “Weekend at Chelsea’s,” anticipation is mounting among audiences eager to see the comedic take on Hillary Clinton's health and her portrayal in the media. The film, which promises to blend humor with political commentary, has sparked conversations about the former Secretary of State's well-being and the media's role in shaping public perception.

Critics of the media have increasingly voiced concerns over what they perceive as overly supportive coverage of Clinton, particularly regarding her health. Many assert that the press has a tendency to downplay significant health issues affecting Clinton, creating a narrative that minimizes the severity of her condition. This has led to accusations that the media is not only failing to hold Clinton accountable but is also contributing to a lack of transparency surrounding her health.

Clinton's health has been a topic of discussion for several years, with claims emerging that she is severely ill. These assertions are often backed by references to her past medical emergencies, including a well-documented episode of fainting in 2016, which raised alarms among her supporters and critics alike. Adding to the speculation is the presence of a personal physician who reportedly accompanies her during public appearances, further fueling concerns about her health status.

One striking detail that has not gone unnoticed is Clinton's choice to wear blue-tinted glasses. These glasses are often associated with individuals suffering from seizure disorders and conditions like Parkinson’s disease. Observers have pointed out that this choice may signal deeper health issues, leading to further scrutiny of her fitness for public office.

The Clinton campaign has faced accusations of not being transparent about her health issues, with many questioning the sincerity of her public statements. Critics argue that her perceived dishonesty regarding her health raises significant concerns about her ability to serve effectively as president. This sentiment has been echoed in various political circles, where Clinton's health has become a focal point of debate.

As Clinton's health struggles have become more pronounced, her poll numbers have begun to reflect the growing unease among voters. Recent surveys indicate a decline in her popularity, which some attribute to her controversial remarks about Donald Trump’s supporters. These comments, perceived as dismissive, have not only alienated potential voters but have also contributed to a broader sense of disillusionment with her candidacy.

Moreover, Clinton's statements regarding racism and her political history have sparked accusations of hypocrisy. Critics argue that her past actions and comments contradict her current rhetoric, leading to a disconnect between her public persona and her political history. This perceived inconsistency has further eroded trust among constituents, complicating her path to the presidency.

Despite the controversies and challenges surrounding her health, there remains a sense of mixed feelings among the public regarding Clinton's situation. While many express concern for her well-being, others grapple with the implications of her health on her political ambitions. The tragedy of her struggles evokes sympathy, even amid the political discourse that surrounds her.

Speculation continues to swirl regarding Clinton's potential to secure the presidency, even in light of her health challenges. Some analysts suggest that her political experience and established network may still position her as a formidable candidate, regardless of the obstacles she faces. This speculation adds an intriguing layer to the ongoing conversation about her candidacy and the future of her political career.

In the midst of these discussions, a sense of duality emerges. Many find themselves hoping for Clinton's political downfall while simultaneously wishing for her personal well-being. This complex sentiment reflects a broader struggle within the political landscape, where personal health and political aspirations intersect in unpredictable ways.

As the film “Weekend at Chelsea’s” prepares for its release, it stands as a testament to the current climate surrounding Clinton's health and media portrayal. The blend of humor and satire may provide a unique lens through which audiences can engage with the serious issues at play, all while reflecting on the implications of her health on her presidential aspirations.

In conclusion, the anticipation for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” underscores the ongoing discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and the media's role in shaping public perception. As critics continue to voice concerns about transparency and honesty, the film may serve as a catalyst for further discussions about the intersection of health, politics, and media in the modern era. Whether Clinton can navigate these challenges and maintain her candidacy remains to be seen, but the conversation surrounding her health is likely to persist as a focal point in the political landscape.",-18.0,-2.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,872.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.0022935779816513763

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In his final address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama expressed deep concerns about the ongoing struggle against ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. The speech, delivered with a tone of somber reflection, underscored the limitations of U.S. military power in effectively combating these threats, which he referred to as a ""JV team."" This characterization highlights Obama's belief that the current military approach may be inadequate in addressing the complexities of modern warfare against such groups.

Obama's remarks pointed to the stark reality that, as a self-designated global police force, the United States faces significant challenges in its battle against ISIS. He articulated a sense of futility, stating that the U.S. has no chance of winning this fight through military means alone. The former president noted the alarming growth in both military capabilities and the number of militants within the Islamic State, reinforcing his conviction that a viable military solution is elusive.

The address took a critical turn as Obama emphasized the necessity for honesty regarding the nature of these conflicts. He advocated for a shift in strategy, underscoring the importance of diplomacy as a means to halt violence and provide assistance to those in desperate need. In particular, he described the situation in Syria as one where no definitive military victory can be achieved, calling attention to the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded in the region.

Obama's vision extended beyond military action; he urged the international community to support political settlements that uphold the dignity and respect of all communities affected by conflict. He recognized that sustainable peace cannot be achieved through force alone but requires a commitment to understanding and addressing the root causes of violence.

The speech also included a pointed critique of liberal perspectives that often overlook the connection between radical Islam and acts of violence. Obama argued for a more nuanced understanding of these issues, encouraging a dialogue that recognizes the complexities involved rather than resorting to a defeatist attitude. He stressed the urgency of taking action against radical Islam, advocating for a proactive rather than reactive approach to international security.

In conclusion, Obama's address at the U.N. Assembly served as a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead in the fight against extremism. His call for diplomacy and political solutions, coupled with a recognition of the limitations of military intervention, paints a picture of a world where collaboration and understanding are essential to overcoming the threats posed by groups like ISIS. The former president's reflections resonate with a growing sentiment that the path to peace requires more than just military might; it demands a concerted effort to engage with the complexities of global conflicts and to foster respect for all communities involved.",-5.0,0.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,511.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have unveiled critical insights into the rise of ISIS and the establishment of a terror state, or caliphate, dating back to 2012. The revelations suggest that the Obama Administration allegedly created conditions that facilitated ISIS's isolation of the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad.

The documents predict that the support from Western nations, Turkey, and the Persian Gulf for Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the formation of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed highlights that the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad's regime, despite the inherent risks of an emerging 'Islamic State.'

Former President Obama’s characterization of ISIS as a “JV” team, coupled with the failure to maintain a residual U.S. military force in Iraq, is now viewed as significant miscalculations. These oversights are scrutinized in light of the new evidence, which outlines the unintended consequences of U.S. foreign policy in the region.

Furthermore, the documents provide insights into weapons operations in Libya prior to the infamous 2012 Benghazi attack. U.S. intelligence agencies were reportedly aware of arms being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports, raising questions about the extent of U.S. involvement in the proliferation of weapons to groups that would later contribute to the instability in the region.

The report also suggests a troubling narrative regarding American servicemen and women, indicating that they may have been sacrificed due to a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that prioritized concealment over national security. This revelation poses significant ethical questions about the decisions made at the highest levels of government during a tumultuous period in the Middle East.

As these documents continue to surface, the implications of U.S. actions in the region are likely to be a focal point for further investigation and debate, particularly regarding the long-term consequences of foreign policy decisions made over the past decade.",-27.0,-6.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,355.0,-0.5454545454545454,-0.016901408450704224
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed just before entering her van after being removed from a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York City. The incident has sparked widespread concern and speculation regarding her health and fitness to campaign amid a highly competitive election season.

Following her collapse, Clinton was seen later at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her appearance. Many remarked that she looked noticeably different—lighter, more vibrant, and with altered facial features that have led to rampant speculation about the authenticity of her identity.

One of the most discussed changes was a significant alteration in the shape of her nose. Observers suggested that it may indicate a possible rhinoplasty, with the new nose described as Roman, contrasting sharply with what has been characterized as Hillary's Nordic nose. This change has fueled theories that the individual spotted after her collapse may not be the real Hillary Clinton but rather a double.

Further compounding the mystery, the clone—if that is indeed what she is—appears younger and lacks a distinctive mole that Hillary has above her lip. This absence has led to even more speculation about the authenticity of the person seen at Chelsea's apartment, raising questions about whether it was truly Hillary or a lookalike.

The implications of this situation extend beyond mere curiosity about Clinton's appearance. Concerns are mounting about her health and whether she is fit to engage in the rigorous demands of a presidential campaign and debates, particularly with her opponent, Donald Trump, looming on the horizon. The political landscape is charged, and any perceived weakness could have significant ramifications for her candidacy.

Observers are advised to closely monitor Clinton’s appearance in the coming weeks for any signs of youthfulness or health issues. This scrutiny is not merely about aesthetics; it’s a question of identity and authenticity. Is this the real Hillary Clinton, or are we witnessing the public appearances of her double? The uncertainty surrounding her health and appearance raises questions that could impact her campaign strategy.

Moreover, speculation has arisen regarding the potential dynamics of a Clinton administration, should she win the election. Questions linger about whether the real Hillary Clinton would be involved in her administration or if her double would handle public appearances and decision-making processes. This scenario has led to concerns about the authenticity and integrity of a potential Clinton administration, suggesting it could be run by her cabinet while the clone takes center stage.

This situation echoes previous speculation surrounding other political figures, notably President Obama, where questions about authenticity and identity have emerged. Such theories often stem from a growing mistrust in political figures, as constituents grapple with the complexities of modern political life and the pressures that come with it. The public's faith in their leaders is paramount, and any indication that a leader is not who they claim to be can foster deep-seated skepticism.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Clinton's recent health scare and the subsequent changes in her appearance cannot be understated. The questions raised about her identity, health, and the potential involvement of a double in her campaign are significant. They highlight a broader narrative of mistrust and speculation that permeates contemporary politics.

In conclusion, the views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. As the election approaches, the public will undoubtedly remain vigilant, watching closely for any further developments regarding Hillary Clinton's health and authenticity, which could ultimately shape the course of the campaign and the future of her political career.",8.0,12.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,688.0,0.4444444444444444,0.01744186046511628
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent speculation surrounding Hillary Clinton has intensified, with rumors suggesting she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. The discourse gained traction following the release of a video that shows Clinton struggling with eye control, raising eyebrows and prompting further scrutiny of her health.

In light of the video incident, Clinton canceled a scheduled fundraiser in North Carolina, a decision that has only fueled the growing concerns about her well-being. Research indicates that Clinton has only one rally planned between September 20 and October 19, with no speaking engagements listed at fundraisers during this period. This stark contrast is highlighted by Donald Trump, who has four rallies scheduled within the same timeframe, showcasing a marked difference in campaign activity between the two political figures.

Questions regarding Clinton's health have been further amplified by reports of her requiring Secret Service assistance to navigate a set of stairs, an incident that has drawn attention to her physical condition. Observers are predicting that Clinton's health issues are likely to become more pronounced in the near future, potentially leading to a public meltdown.

As these concerns continue to mount, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly exploring potential replacements for Clinton, a move that underscores the party's anxiety about her viability as a candidate. Despite the DNC's efforts to position Clinton as the best choice for the upcoming elections, there is a notable lack of support from other prominent candidates, including Bernie Sanders, which raises further questions about her standing within the party.

The situation has led to speculation that Clinton's health issues may soon be disclosed to the public, potentially validating long-standing conspiracy theories regarding her condition. The implications of these developments reflect poorly on the Democratic Party, with some critics labeling the party as ""crooked"" for its handling of the situation.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, many are left wondering how Clinton's health will impact her campaign and the DNC's strategy moving forward. Further developments are anticipated in the coming days, as the party navigates these turbulent waters and the public remains vigilant for updates on Clinton's health and campaign activities.",-8.0,4.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,407.0,0.3076923076923077,0.009828009828009828
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

**By [Your Name]**

In a twist of fate that could rival the most imaginative political thrillers, former President Barack Obama found himself in a peculiar situation late one night in the White House. Struggling to find sleep due to the thunderous snoring of his wife, Michelle, Obama wandered the dimly lit halls of the West Wing, feeling a mix of sadness and restlessness. It was during this midnight stroll that he stumbled upon a word that would later take on a life of its own: ""ISIS.""

This seemingly innocuous moment would set the stage for an idea that would evolve in the most unexpected ways. Grabbing a Post-It note, Obama scribbled down the word, unaware of the profound implications it would carry in the months to come.

Fast forward several months to the vibrant atmosphere of Coachella, where the pulsating beats of electronic music filled the air. Surrounded by the energy of the festival, a spark ignited within Obama. Amidst the revelry, the thought of starting an international terrorist organization emerged—an idea that was as shocking as it was surreal. The name he chose for this organization? ISIS. It was a nod to that fateful night in the White House, where the seed of this controversial concept had been planted.

Feeling emboldened by this revelation, Obama sought out a confidante who would understand the weight of his aspirations: Hillary Clinton. The two found themselves sharing a moment of levity as they enjoyed Popsicles, a seemingly innocent treat that belied the gravity of their conversation. With a mix of humor and sincerity, Obama shared his secret ambitions, claiming in jest that he was a 97-year-old Kenyan man sent to destroy America. The absurdity of his claim elicited a shocked reaction from Hillary, who struggled to process the bizarre twist of their discussion.

As the conversation unfolded, Obama introduced another layer to his narrative: his beloved dog, Bo. He explained that Bo was no ordinary canine but a supercomputer capable of sending messages in Morse code to various terrorist organizations. The revelation left Hillary in disbelief, her confusion palpable. Yet, amidst the absurdity, the two shared a light-hearted moment that highlighted the unique bond they shared.

Their discussions took a more serious turn as they moved to the serene setting of the Rose Garden, where they continued to enjoy snacks and drinks. It was here, amidst the blooming flowers and the chirping of birds, that they delved deeper into Obama’s unconventional plans for ISIS. The atmosphere was charged with creativity and camaraderie, as they brainstormed ideas that strayed far from the traditional political discourse.

In a moment of unexpected synergy, Hillary suggested they wait until she became president to secretly destroy America together. The thrill of this proposition sparked a sense of excitement in Obama, who felt a deep connection to Hillary as they explored these unconventional ideas. Their laughter echoed through the garden as they reveled in the absurdity of their conversation, united by a shared understanding of the complexities of power, ambition, and friendship.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the Rose Garden, Obama and Hillary found themselves contemplating the implications of their discussions. The light-hearted banter had transformed into a profound exploration of identity, ambition, and the fine line between humor and reality in the world of politics. 

In this unexpected narrative of late-night musings and festival inspiration, the origins of ISIS took on a new dimension, one that intertwined the personal and the political in ways few could have anticipated. What began as a restless night in the White House evolved into a whimsical yet thought-provoking dialogue between two of the most prominent figures in American politics. 

As they wrapped up their conversation, both Obama and Hillary understood that while their ideas may have been unconventional, the bond they shared and the laughter they exchanged were rooted in a deeper understanding of the challenges they faced in their political careers. In a world often fraught with tension and division, their ability to find humor and connection in the most unexpected places served as a reminder of the power of friendship and the importance of embracing the absurdity of life.

In the end, the story of how an idea born from a sleepless night and a festival experience evolved into a conversation about power, friendship, and the complexities of ambition serves as a testament to the unpredictable nature of political life. As Obama and Hillary continued to navigate their respective journeys, the memories of that night in the White House and the Rose Garden would linger, a reminder of the light-hearted moments that can emerge even in the most serious of contexts. 

And so, the tale of Obama, Hillary, and the origins of ISIS remains a curious chapter in the annals of political history—one that invites us to reflect on the power of imagination, the bonds of friendship, and the often absurd nature of the world we inhabit.",-4.0,27.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,935.0,0.7941176470588235,0.028877005347593583
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

**By Frank Wilkenmeyer, September 19, 2016**

In the wake of recent terror attacks in Chelsea, New York, and Minnesota, Donald Trump has made headlines with his fervent promises to ""destroy the existential threat of terrorism"" in America. While the rhetoric may resonate with a populace grappling with fear and uncertainty, a closer examination reveals significant implications that merit scrutiny.

Trump's declarations come at a time when the nation is grappling with the realities of terrorism, and his approach raises questions about the effectiveness and morality of the proposed solutions. Central to the critique of Trump's response is the absence of a concrete plan to combat terrorism beyond the sweeping promises that seem to dominate his speeches. The lack of specifics regarding increased funding or comprehensive counter-terrorism strategies points to a troubling gap between rhetoric and actionable policy.

Moreover, Trump's statements may inadvertently suggest a path toward profiling Muslims and enacting measures reminiscent of the controversial Patriot Act. Such implications raise alarms about the erosion of civil liberties and the potential for discrimination against a significant segment of the American population. The suggestion of profiling based on religion could lead to a chilling environment for Muslim communities, fostering division rather than unity in the face of a common threat.

Concerns about due process and the constitutional rights of American citizens suspected of terrorism also loom large in the context of Trump's promises. The notion that individuals could be targeted based on their faith or ethnicity raises fundamental questions about the principles that underpin American democracy. The potential for heavy policing and the segregation of Muslim communities could exacerbate tensions and lead to a cycle of mistrust and fear that undermines the very fabric of society.

The historical parallels drawn between Trump's promises and the rise of fascism are troubling. The fear of the ""other"" has often been a catalyst for authoritarian regimes, and the language used by Trump may evoke memories of darker times in history. The specter of using fear as a political tool to galvanize support is a tactic that, while effective in the short term, poses long-term risks to the values of liberty and justice.

In conclusion, while Trump's commitment to addressing terrorism may resonate with those seeking security, the reality is that his promises appear unrealistic and steeped in fear-mongering. The implications of his rhetoric extend far beyond the immediate context of national security, potentially paving the way for policies that could undermine civil liberties and sow discord among communities. As the nation continues to navigate the complexities of terrorism, it is crucial to seek solutions that uphold the principles of justice and equality, rather than succumb to the allure of fear-driven rhetoric.",-28.0,-24.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,513.0,-1.411764705882353,-0.04678362573099415
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.

In a stark warning, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has highlighted a precarious tipping point in global security, citing the growing threats posed by terrorism and increased hostilities from nations such as the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno's remarks underscore the urgency of the situation, as he noted that the Army is currently only able to generate enough readiness to meet immediate operational needs. He cautioned that any further reductions in military capacity could lead to dire consequences for national and allied security.

Odierno's comments reflect a broader concern regarding the disconnect between military leadership and the current administration. This gap, which began during the Obama Administration, has been characterized by a disregard for the strategies and advice provided by military commanders. This disconnect has been linked to the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa, raising alarms about the implications for U.S. interests abroad.

Describing the current landscape as a strategic inflection point, Odierno emphasized that determined enemies are increasingly threatening the safety of the United States and its allies. The Army's operational capabilities have already been significantly impacted by recent reductions, having seen its active force shrink by 80,000 soldiers. Additionally, the restructuring of the Army has led to the elimination of 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades, further constraining its readiness.

Moreover, Odierno pointed to a troubling decline in investment for military modernization, which has decreased by 25%. This reduction has adversely affected critical programs, including the modernization of infantry fighting vehicles and the development of scout helicopters, essential components of the Army's future operational effectiveness.

As the global security environment continues to evolve, Odierno's warnings serve as a call to action for policymakers to reassess military readiness and investment strategies to ensure the U.S. military remains capable of addressing both current and emerging threats.",-4.0,-14.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,355.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.03943661971830986

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

Critics of the proposal argue that it could pave the way for countries with authoritarian regimes, such as Russia, China, and Iran, to impose censorship on Internet content, potentially extending even to users in the United States. Cruz has characterized the proposal as an extraordinary threat to American freedoms, warning that many citizens remain unaware of the potential ramifications.

With the change scheduled to take effect on September 30, 2016, Cruz is urging Congress to take immediate action to prevent the transfer from occurring. He emphasizes the urgency of the situation, highlighting the need for legislative intervention to safeguard the rights of Americans and maintain the integrity of the Internet as a platform for free expression.",3.0,-6.0,218.0,0.2727272727272727,0.013761467889908258,212.0,-1.0,-0.02830188679245283
Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

This decision follows an unspecified incident that occurred last week, prompting university officials to take action.

An email sent by a Clemson administrator instructed Resident Advisors (RAs) to enforce the removal of all Harambe references from dormitories. The directive clearly states that all references to the internet meme must be banned in public and communal areas within the campus. RAs were also warned that students who do not comply with this directive could face consequences.

The move has sparked discussions about the implications of meme culture on campus and the university's role in regulating student expression. While the administration defends the ban as a necessary step towards fostering a respectful environment, some students may view it as an infringement on free speech.

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

In the United States, every state has established its own laws governing election methods and procedures, creating a complex landscape for voters and officials alike. Amidst this framework, serious allegations have emerged against the National Democratic Party, which is accused of attempting to manipulate the electoral process through various illegal means. These claims raise significant concerns about the integrity of American democracy and the future of the electoral system.

The author of this piece posits that the Democratic Party harbors ambitions to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States. This assertion is grounded in a series of allegations that suggest the party has engaged in voter fraud and ballot stuffing, particularly during the 2016 presidential election. The author argues that these tactics were employed to ensure Hillary Clinton’s election, thereby undermining the democratic process.

Central to this discussion is the advocacy for a fair election process that mandates proper voter registration and the use of photo identification. The author contends that the requirement for ID is a necessary measure to ensure that only eligible voters can participate in elections. This stance is met with the claim that the Democratic Party actively opposes such ID requirements, allegedly to facilitate the participation of ineligible voters. Such opposition raises questions about the party's commitment to maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.

The author further alleges that the Democratic Party, in conjunction with the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system, has worked to suppress fair election laws. This alleged suppression is viewed as a direct threat to the principles of democracy and an attempt to manipulate electoral outcomes in favor of the party’s candidates. The implications of these claims are profound, suggesting that the very foundation of American democracy is at risk due to internal machinations.

In light of these allegations, the author calls upon citizens to take an active role in monitoring polling places to prevent voter fraud. This call to action emphasizes the importance of civic engagement and the need for vigilant oversight during elections. By volunteering as monitors, citizens can help ensure that the electoral process remains transparent and fair, safeguarding the integrity of the vote.

The article paints a positive picture of Donald Trump, portraying him as a patriotic figure dedicated to saving the country from what is described as Democratic corruption. This characterization positions Trump as a champion of the values that the author believes are essential for preserving the republic. The emphasis on November 8, 2016, as a critical date underscores the urgency of the situation, framing it as a pivotal moment for the nation’s future.

The author urges citizens who value Constitutional Conservatism to actively participate in monitoring elections. This appeal is rooted in a desire to uphold the principles of democracy and ensure that the electoral process is free from manipulation. By fostering a culture of accountability and vigilance, the author believes that citizens can play a crucial role in protecting the integrity of the electoral system.

It is important to note that the views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. Nonetheless, the concerns raised about the electoral process are indicative of a broader dialogue within American society regarding the integrity of elections and the role of political parties in shaping the democratic landscape.

As the nation moves forward, the call for a fair election process remains a pressing issue. The interplay between voter registration, identification requirements, and the allegations of fraud and manipulation highlight the complexities of ensuring that every vote counts. Citizens are encouraged to engage in discussions about these topics and to take proactive steps to ensure that the electoral process remains a true reflection of the will of the people.

In conclusion, the call for vigilance and active participation in the electoral process serves as a reminder of the responsibilities that come with democracy. As citizens navigate the challenges of the current political climate, the importance of safeguarding the integrity of elections cannot be overstated. The future of the republic may very well depend on the actions taken today to ensure that every vote is counted and that the principles of democracy are upheld.",-52.0,28.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,778.0,0.9333333333333333,0.03598971722365039
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the annals of political advertising, few pieces have left as indelible a mark as the 1964 ""Daisy"" advertisement, created for President Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign. This ad, which featured a young girl plucking petals from a daisy before transitioning to the ominous imagery of a nuclear mushroom cloud, was a stark portrayal of the stakes involved in the presidential election. It served not only as a poignant reminder of the Cold War tensions but also as a powerful tool to frame Johnson's opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a reckless warmonger. The ad's impact was profound, influencing public perception and ultimately contributing to Johnson's landslide victory.

As we reflect on the historical significance of the ""Daisy"" advertisement, it is tempting to consider how a modern iteration could be crafted to address the current political landscape. The suggestion arises that a contemporary version of the ad could focus on the perceived failures of Hillary Clinton, presenting her as unworthy of the presidency. Such a remake would undoubtedly aim to evoke strong emotions and provoke thought, much like its predecessor did nearly six decades ago.

However, whispers of a potential ""Daisy"" remake targeting Donald Trump have surfaced, hinting at a sense of desperation among Clinton's campaign staff. The notion of resurrecting such a potent piece of political rhetoric suggests that the stakes are perceived to be high, and the need for impactful messaging is urgent. It raises questions about the effectiveness of current campaign strategies and the lengths to which political operatives might go to sway public opinion.

In discussing the current political climate, it is essential to examine the media's role in shaping narratives around candidates. Recent coverage of Ted Cruz's political shifts has drawn criticism, particularly regarding how journalists have framed his evolving positions and the context of his past insults towards Donald Trump. This inconsistency in coverage highlights a broader trend in journalism, where critical information is often relegated to the latter parts of articles. This practice caters to readers' short attention spans, potentially skewing public understanding of complex political dynamics.

Moreover, the perception of bias in media coverage remains a contentious issue. Many observers point to a consistent pattern of critical reporting on Democrats and liberal policies, often encapsulated in the label of the ""liberal press."" This bias not only affects the portrayal of candidates but also influences public discourse, shaping the way voters perceive political issues and their leaders.

As the upcoming presidential debate looms, concerns about biased moderating are at the forefront of many political analysts' minds. Past experiences have shown that moderators can inadvertently introduce bias into the debate, affecting the candidates' performances and the overall narrative that emerges from these critical events. The stakes are high, and the potential for biased questioning could have significant implications for the candidates involved, particularly for those seeking to overcome negative perceptions.

In the context of Hillary Clinton, it is worth recalling the criticisms she faced from prominent figures such as Barack Obama and Michelle Obama during her previous campaigns. These critiques, while significant, often seem to be overlooked in contemporary discussions about her candidacy. The selective memory of the electorate and the media can obscure important aspects of a candidate's history, leading to a distorted view of their qualifications and capabilities.

As we navigate the complexities of modern political campaigning, the call to revisit the ""Daisy"" commercial concept becomes increasingly relevant. A new version, grounded in factual documentation of Clinton's failures, could serve as a powerful reminder of the stakes involved in the upcoming election. By drawing upon the emotional resonance of the original ad while incorporating contemporary data and narratives, such a campaign could effectively engage voters and provoke critical reflection on the candidates' respective qualifications.

In conclusion, the historical impact of the 1964 ""Daisy"" advertisement offers a rich tapestry of lessons for today's political landscape. As candidates seek to navigate the complexities of modern campaigning, the echoes of past strategies remind us of the power of imagery and narrative in shaping public perception. Whether through a revival of the ""Daisy"" concept or through new approaches to political messaging, the need for impactful communication remains paramount in the quest for electoral success. As we move forward, the interplay between media coverage, candidate narratives, and voter perceptions will continue to shape the trajectory of American politics.",-18.0,3.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,832.0,0.1,0.003605769230769231

Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

The debate over President Barack Obama's birth certificate has intensified, with Democrats accusing critics of employing intimidation tactics. Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, has labeled the questioning of the birth certificate as inherently racist. However, this argument has faced scrutiny, with critics arguing that questioning the legitimacy of a black president's birth certificate does not automatically equate to racial bias.

Evidence has emerged suggesting the birth certificate in question may have been altered. Reports indicate that Obama’s social security number was issued in Connecticut, yet there is no record of him residing there. Furthermore, the hospital listed on the birth certificate allegedly did not exist at the time the document was issued, raising further questions about its authenticity. These discrepancies have led some to suggest possible falsification of the birth certificate.

Despite the significant evidence pointing to issues with the birth certificate, no original document has been produced. Instead, accusations of racism have been employed to discredit those raising legitimate concerns about its validity. 

The ongoing discourse has been met with disappointment from some quarters, particularly regarding Donald Trump’s response to the allegations of racism surrounding the birth certificate debate. The complexities of this issue continue to unfold, highlighting the intersection of race, politics, and truth in American society.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article critiques the perception of Islam as a peaceful religion, highlighting instances of violence against homosexuals.

This incident was not isolated. Just prior to Woods' assault, another attack involving a gay couple highlighted a troubling trend of homophobic violence. Sgt. Peter Allan expressed his sadness over these recent assaults, acknowledging the pain inflicted on the victims while also noting that both were recovering and that arrests had been made in connection to the attacks.

The juxtaposition of the gay community's acceptance with Islamic teachings, which traditionally condemn homosexuality, raises significant concerns. While some American Muslims have shown a more accepting attitude towards LGBTQ+ individuals, the article argues that radical interpretations of Islam and the principles of the gay community are fundamentally incompatible. This tension underscores the challenges faced by individuals who identify with both communities.

As discussions around the perception of Islam continue, it is crucial to address the realities of violence that some homosexuals face and to consider the implications of these actions on broader societal perceptions. The incidents involving Woods and others remind us that the narrative of Islam as a solely peaceful religion is challenged by the actions of individuals who invoke its tenets to justify violence against marginalized groups.

In light of these events, it is essential to foster dialogue that promotes understanding while also holding accountable those who perpetrate violence in the name of any ideology. The ongoing conflict between radical beliefs and the values of acceptance remains a pressing issue that society must confront.",-26.0,-43.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,407.0,-2.5294117647058822,-0.10565110565110565
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).

Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

In a shocking incident that has sent ripples through the St. Cloud community and beyond, a man in a security uniform launched a violent attack on shoppers at a local mall, leaving nine people injured. The assailant, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" during the assault, raising alarm and fear among those present.

Witnesses to the attack described a chaotic scene as Adan moved through the mall, confronting shoppers. Disturbingly, he allegedly asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before proceeding to stab them. This targeting has drawn attention to the motivations behind the attack, with many in the community left grappling with the implications.

Members of the St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly recognized Adan as the attacker, leading to a wave of shock and disbelief. In the wake of the incident, community leaders expressed their support for Adan's family, describing him as a good man and an accomplished student. This sentiment underscores the complexities within immigrant communities, especially when faced with acts of violence that seem to contradict their values.

The situation escalated when ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, identifying Adan as one of their members. This declaration not only added a layer of terror to the incident but also highlighted ongoing concerns about the recruitment of Somali refugees in Minnesota by extremist groups. Reports indicate that terror organizations, including ISIS and al-Shabab, have been actively targeting this demographic, raising alarms about potential threats to U.S. security.

The attack at the mall follows a troubling trend of violence linked to radicalization. Just prior to the St. Cloud incident, there were other violent acts, including a bomb at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and a meat cleaver attack on police officers in New York City. These incidents have fueled fears of a coordinated effort by extremist groups to instigate violence across the nation.

In a decisive moment during the attack, Officer Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer, intervened and shot Adan, ultimately killing him. The mayor of St. Cloud praised Falconer as a hero, recognizing his quick action in preventing further harm to innocent shoppers. This act of bravery stands in stark contrast to the chaos that unfolded moments before, emphasizing the critical role of law enforcement in emergency situations.

The Somali community in Minnesota has faced increasing scrutiny, particularly in light of numerous convictions among Somali-Americans for collaborating with Islamist terror groups. Al-Shabab, a known terrorist organization, has previously issued warnings about potential attacks on shopping malls, including the high-profile Mall of America. These threats have heightened tensions and fears within both the Somali community and the broader public.

Recent reports indicate a growing strength of ISIS in Somalia, bolstered by support from Yemen. This development raises serious questions about the implications for U.S. security, especially as the nation grapples with the complexities of immigration and refugee policies. The relocation of Somali refugees to the United States has been a contentious issue, with concerns about potential increases in refugee admissions under a future Clinton administration.

The narrative surrounding these events suggests that Muslim immigrants, particularly those from Somalia, are being targeted for recruitment by terror groups. This alarming trend has ignited a political discourse around national security, with calls for action against policies perceived as lenient towards immigration. Critics argue that a potential presidency under Hillary Clinton could exacerbate these challenges, framing her leadership as a threat to American safety.

As the St. Cloud community seeks to heal from the traumatic events of the attack, broader discussions about security, immigration, and the influence of extremist ideologies continue to unfold. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration and the potential risks associated with radicalization. 

In the aftermath, community leaders are urged to engage in open dialogues that foster understanding and counteract the narratives that seek to divide. The St. Cloud Somali-American community, while grappling with the implications of Adan's actions, remains committed to supporting one another and dispelling the myths that threaten their cohesion.

The attack has reignited debates about the effectiveness of current counter-terrorism strategies and the need for comprehensive policies that address the root causes of radicalization. As the nation reflects on this tragic event, the focus must shift toward creating a more secure environment for all, one that promotes safety without compromising the values of diversity and inclusion.

In conclusion, the St. Cloud mall attack is not just a local incident but a reflection of broader issues that challenge American society today. The implications of this event extend far beyond the immediate tragedy, prompting critical discussions about national security, immigration policy, and the ongoing threat of extremist ideologies. As the community comes to terms with the violence, it is imperative that the nation learns from this incident to prevent future acts of terror and promote a more united front against the forces that seek to divide.",-72.0,-77.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,925.0,-1.7906976744186047,-0.08324324324324324
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, Millennials have been often characterized as the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" a label that suggests a shift in societal standards regarding victimhood. This phenomenon has been brought to the forefront in the context of the troubling case involving Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the bombings in New Jersey and New York City. Rahami's narrative of victimhood, particularly his claims of ""Islamophobia,"" raises questions about the broader implications of perceived discrimination in contemporary society.

Rahami and his father took legal action against the police in Elizabeth, New Jersey, alleging that they faced discrimination based on their Islamic faith. Their lawsuit, filed in 2011, claimed that local law enforcement subjected the Rahami family to ""selective enforcement"" concerning their family-owned chicken restaurant, First American. The complaint detailed a series of grievances that Ahmad had with local officials and police, reflecting a deep-seated belief that they were being targeted due to their religion.

The allegations did not stop at law enforcement; the Rahami family also reported experiencing racial abuse from local residents. They recounted instances where they were told, ""Muslims don’t belong here,"" highlighting the challenges they faced in their community. This narrative of victimization, however, is complicated by the subsequent actions of Ahmad Khan Rahami, who would later be implicated in a series of bombings that shocked the nation.

In response to the allegations of discrimination, Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage firmly denied the claims. He attributed the complaints against the Rahami family to issues such as noise and gatherings associated with their restaurant, rather than any bias linked to ethnicity or religion. This counter-narrative underscores the complexities inherent in discussions of victimhood, particularly in a multicultural society where perceptions of discrimination can vary widely.

The Rahami family's lawsuit and the subsequent events surrounding Ahmad Khan Rahami's actions have sparked a broader dialogue about the nature of victimhood in what some may refer to as ""Obama’s America."" This term encapsulates a period marked by heightened awareness and sensitivity to issues of race, religion, and identity, yet it also raises questions about the sincerity and authenticity of claims of victimization.

Critics argue that the current societal climate may encourage individuals to adopt a victimhood mentality, potentially undermining genuine grievances faced by marginalized communities. The case of Ahmad Khan Rahami serves as a poignant example of how the narrative of victimhood can be co-opted, complicating the discourse around discrimination and its implications for community relations.

As society continues to grapple with these issues, the case of the Rahami family raises critical questions about the balance between legitimate claims of discrimination and the potential for manipulation of victimhood narratives. In an era where the line between victim and perpetrator can sometimes blur, the need for nuanced discussions about identity, faith, and community remains more important than ever.",-38.0,-29.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,545.0,-1.6111111111111112,-0.05321100917431193
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to relocate businesses if employees do not vote in their favor.

In a landscape where the intersection of politics and business increasingly shapes the lives of workers, recent statements from Andy Puzder, CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, have sparked significant concern. Historically, employers have used the specter of relocation as a tool to sway employee voting behavior, suggesting that failure to support certain political outcomes could jeopardize jobs. This tactic, while not new, has taken on renewed urgency in light of Puzder’s explicit threats regarding the future of his businesses based on the outcomes of upcoming elections.

Puzder has made it clear that if a Democrat wins the election, he will fully automate his restaurants. He pointed to Eatsa, an automated fast-food system that operates without human staff, as a model for future business practices. This statement raises alarm bells, particularly as it highlights a broader trend where voting in favor of employers often leads to negative consequences for workers, such as job outsourcing and stagnant wages.

The CEO's rationale centers on rising labor costs attributed to minimum wage hikes. He argues that these increases ultimately lead to job losses and a shift toward automation. Puzder’s comments suggest a troubling paradox: he questions the merit of wage increases if they result in a net loss of jobs for others. This perspective not only reflects a corporate mindset focused on profit maximization but also poses a direct threat to the livelihoods of his employees and other minimum wage workers.

By framing his threats in this manner, Puzder appears to be attempting to influence his workforce, which numbers around 20,000, as well as other workers in similar positions, to vote against their own interests. The implications of his statements extend beyond the immediate context of his restaurants; they resonate throughout the fast-food industry and beyond, where the specter of automation looms large.

Moreover, Puzder maintains a blog where he discusses politics and capitalism, prompting questions about how his employees perceive the current economic system. Given his reported earnings of nearly $4.5 million in 2012, alongside rising profits that have not translated into better conditions for his workers, there is a growing sense of discontent among those who labor under his corporate umbrella. Workers may find themselves questioning the fairness of a system that seems to enrich executives while leaving them with stagnant wages and uncertain job security.

The broader implications of Puzder’s stance cannot be overlooked. His comments may serve as a harbinger of an industry-wide shift towards increased automation, regardless of the political climate. As companies prioritize profits, the push for technology that replaces human labor gains momentum. This trend raises critical questions about the future of work and the rights of employees in an era where automation is rapidly becoming the norm.

As the political landscape evolves, workers must navigate a complex web of corporate interests and electoral outcomes. Puzder’s threats serve as a stark reminder of the power dynamics at play, where the decisions made in the voting booth can have far-reaching consequences for job security and economic stability. The challenge for workers lies in understanding these dynamics and advocating for their rights in a system that often appears rigged against them.

In conclusion, the intersection of corporate power and political influence is becoming increasingly pronounced, with figures like Andy Puzder exemplifying the lengths to which some employers will go to protect their interests. As automation looms on the horizon, workers must remain vigilant and informed, recognizing that their votes carry weight in shaping the future of their livelihoods. The fight for fair wages and job security is far from over, and the stakes have never been higher.",21.0,7.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,687.0,0.28,0.010189228529839884
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a development that has stirred significant political discourse, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently probing new evidence linked to Hillary Clinton's controversial use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. This investigation has emerged as part of an inquiry into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin. The unfolding situation raises critical questions about the integrity of the previous investigations and the potential ramifications for those involved.

At the center of the investigation is a shared laptop used by both Abedin and Weiner, which is believed to contain ""tens of thousands of emails"" from Abedin. These emails may include communications that were forwarded from Clinton's account. The discovery of this evidence has reignited scrutiny over Clinton's email practices, particularly regarding whether any of the emails are work-related or classified. If it is determined that Clinton and Abedin misled the FBI about the nature of these communications, it could constitute a prosecutable offense.

The timing of the FBI's announcement is particularly noteworthy, coming just 11 days before the presidential election. This has led to speculation about the seriousness of the findings and the implications they may have on the electoral process. The FBI's decision to release this information so close to the election has drawn criticism and concern from various political factions, with many questioning the motivations behind the timing.

This latest development is a stark contrast to the FBI's actions in July 2016, when FBI Director James Comey detailed the evidence against Clinton but ultimately did not recommend charges. This decision led to significant discontent among FBI officials, many of whom believed that there was sufficient grounds to pursue prosecution against Clinton. A senior FBI official has since indicated that there remains a strong belief within the bureau that Clinton should face legal consequences for her actions.

Adding to the controversy, a recently released 100-page FBI summary has unveiled that a State Department official exerted pressure on the FBI regarding the investigation into Clinton's emails. This revelation has raised further concerns about breaches of security protocols by Clinton and her staff, as well as the influence of political pressures on law enforcement actions.

The situation has also been complicated by financial contributions from Clinton supporters. Notably, a Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official involved in the investigation. This connection has led to allegations of potential conflicts of interest and raised questions about the impartiality of the investigation.

In a related twist, Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was tasked with managing Clinton's email server, deleted over 33,000 emails from the server. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department, which has led to further scrutiny of the FBI's handling of the investigation and the decisions made regarding immunity and prosecution.

In a significant turn of events, leaked emails have suggested that Clinton communicated with President Obama using her private email server. This revelation contradicts previous claims made by Clinton regarding her email practices and raises questions about the extent of her communications while in office.

Moreover, evidence has surfaced indicating that Clinton may have personally deleted emails and could have obstructed justice by removing evidence after a subpoena was issued. This timeline of events suggests a coordinated effort to manage the narrative surrounding Clinton's email use and protect her candidacy from potential fallout.

The investigation has also sparked concerns about potential collusion between the White House, the Clinton campaign, and mainstream media to influence the election. As new evidence continues to emerge, the implications of this investigation could have far-reaching consequences for all parties involved.

As the FBI delves deeper into this complex web of emails, political affiliations, and potential misconduct, the public remains on edge, awaiting clarity on whether these developments will lead to significant legal ramifications for Hillary Clinton and her associates. The investigation is set against a backdrop of heightened political tensions and a deeply divided electorate, making the stakes higher than ever as the nation approaches the election. 

In conclusion, the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server has taken a new turn with the discovery of potentially incriminating evidence. As the investigation unfolds, the implications for Clinton, her associates, and the broader political landscape remain uncertain. The coming weeks are likely to be crucial in determining the outcome of this high-stakes inquiry and its impact on the upcoming election.",-6.0,-1.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,832.0,-0.03225806451612903,-0.001201923076923077
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, known for her strong advocacy of accepting Syrian refugees, has recently found herself at the center of a contentious debate following a surge in crime linked to her open borders policy. This approach, which welcomed a significant influx of migrants, has led to reports of thousands of sexual assaults and violent crimes in various German cities, prompting a backlash from the German public.

The increase in crime has had serious political repercussions for Merkel and her conservative Democrat party. The negative public reaction culminated in a significant electoral defeat, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs. In the wake of this electoral setback, Merkel has expressed regret about the handling of the migrant crisis, suggesting that the challenges faced could have been avoided. She has also criticized the concept of multiculturalism, labeling it a “living lie.”

At her party's recent annual conference, Merkel acknowledged the pressing need to regain control over the influx of migrants. She articulated concerns that continued high levels of immigration could overwhelm Germany's social and economic systems. While she reiterated her commitment to reducing the number of refugees entering the country, she stopped short of agreeing to a specific cap on arrivals, opting instead for a more nuanced approach.

Merkel emphasized the importance of a coordinated strategy to manage migration effectively, advocating for collaboration at the German, European, and global levels. This approach aims to regulate and limit the influx of migrants while addressing the underlying issues that have driven individuals to seek refuge in Germany.

As Merkel navigates the complexities of public sentiment and political pressures, her administration faces the challenge of balancing humanitarian responsibilities with the safety and security concerns of German citizens. The path forward remains uncertain, but the chancellor's recent statements signal a potential shift in policy direction as she seeks to restore public confidence and stabilize her party's standing in the political landscape.",-2.0,-18.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,367.0,-1.5,-0.04904632152588556

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.",http://freedomdaily.com/disgusting-because-of-hillary-obama-ny-terrorist-will-get-better-treatment-than-us-vets/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3895D4C900000578-3798726-Ahmad_Khan_Rahami_28_was_taken_into_custody_on_Monday_after_a_sh-a-65_1474398076306.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a stark contrast that has ignited public outrage, a terrorist responsible for detonating explosives in New Jersey and New York City is set to receive superior medical care compared to many U.S. veterans. This troubling revelation has once again brought to light the ongoing issues within the Veterans Administration (VA), which has faced scrutiny for its handling of veteran care.

The issue was highlighted during a recent campaign speech by former President Donald Trump, who criticized the disparity in medical treatment afforded to individuals like Ahmad Rahami, the accused terrorist, versus the veterans who have served the nation. Trump commended law enforcement for their efforts in capturing Rahami, but he did not shy away from pointing out the irony that this individual would receive high-quality medical treatment, complete with modern hospital accommodations and legal representation.

The article recalls a significant scandal that rocked the VA back in 2014, when reports surfaced of long waiting lists and systemic inefficiencies that plagued the organization. This crisis has had severe consequences, with over 300,000 veterans reportedly dying while waiting for the care they desperately needed. The situation has been further exacerbated by the alarming rates of suicide among veterans, many of whom have taken their own lives while still in the queue for treatment.

The frustration surrounding this issue is palpable, as many citizens express their dismay over the government’s apparent prioritization of care for a terrorist over those who have dedicated their lives to serving the country. This sentiment has resonated with veterans and their families, who feel abandoned by a system that is meant to support them in their time of need.

As the nation grapples with the implications of these disparities in care, the conversation surrounding veteran treatment continues to grow. Advocates for veterans’ rights are calling for urgent reforms within the VA to ensure that those who have sacrificed for their country receive the care and respect they deserve.

The juxtaposition of high-quality care for a convicted terrorist against the backdrop of veterans' struggles has sparked a national dialogue about the moral obligations of the government. Many are questioning how a system can be so misaligned, where a terrorist receives better treatment than those who have served honorably. The need for change is clear, as the nation reflects on its values and the responsibilities it holds towards its veterans.",13.0,-16.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,441.0,-1.1428571428571428,-0.036281179138321996
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a dramatic turn of events in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, made headlines after he intervened in a violent attack by an ISIS terrorist, saving the lives of eight individuals. Falconer’s quick response during the stabbing incident highlighted not only his commitment to public safety but also the importance of Second Amendment rights, which he actively promotes through his business, Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc.

Falconer’s company has become a vital resource for law-abiding citizens seeking firearms training, gun rentals, and sales. His dedication to equipping individuals with the skills necessary to defend themselves has garnered support from many who believe in the right to bear arms. However, Falconer now finds himself in the crosshairs of a political campaign, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has vowed to target his business if elected president.

Clinton’s campaign has expressed intentions to dismantle the protections afforded to firearms businesses under the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). This legislation provides legal safeguards against frivolous lawsuits that could threaten the viability of companies like Falconer’s. Critics argue that Clinton’s characterization of PLCAA as granting “immunity” to gunmakers and dealers is misleading. The law is designed to protect lawful commerce in firearms, ensuring that businesses can operate without the constant fear of litigation stemming from the misuse of their products by criminals.

Falconer’s commitment to safeguarding citizens extends beyond his role as a firearms trainer; he has spent years serving as a law enforcement officer, dedicating his life to protecting the community. His actions during the attack in St. Cloud exemplify the very principles he espouses through his training programs—self-defense, preparedness, and the responsible use of firearms.

The political implications of Clinton’s stance on gun rights are significant. Her opposition to the Second Amendment is seen by many as a direct threat to the rights of citizens to defend themselves and their families. Falconer’s situation serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing debate surrounding gun control and the rights of law-abiding citizens to access firearms for personal protection.

In the wake of the St. Cloud incident, the narrative surrounding gun rights has intensified, with advocates on both sides of the issue voicing their opinions. Supporters of Second Amendment rights argue that incidents like the one Falconer faced underscore the necessity of responsible firearm ownership and training. They contend that individuals like Falconer play a crucial role in fostering a culture of safety and preparedness, capable of responding to threats in real-time.

Conversely, Clinton’s proposed policies suggest a fundamental shift in how firearms are regulated and perceived in society. By targeting businesses like Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., her campaign raises questions about the future of firearms training and the rights of individuals to seek instruction in the use of firearms.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Falconer remains steadfast in his mission to empower citizens through education and training. His story has become emblematic of the broader struggle over gun rights in America, as advocates rally to protect the Second Amendment against what they perceive as encroachments from political figures.

In conclusion, the clash between Jason Falconer’s commitment to firearms training and Hillary Clinton’s political ambitions serves as a focal point in the ongoing debate over gun rights in the United States. As Falconer continues to promote responsible firearm ownership, the implications of political opposition to the Second Amendment remain a pressing concern for many Americans.",-11.0,11.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,670.0,0.4230769230769231,0.016417910447761194
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election heats up, the health of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has emerged as a focal point of discussion among voters and analysts alike. With just weeks remaining until the election, Clinton's health has become a daily topic, influencing public perception and potentially her campaign's viability.

Recent polling data reveals a troubling trend regarding voter sentiment about Clinton's health. Over 40% of registered voters now believe she is in ""below average"" or ""very poor"" health, a notable rise from just 26% in a previous poll conducted at the end of August. This significant increase raises questions about the impact of health-related concerns on her candidacy. Meanwhile, 28% of voters consider her health to be ""average,"" while a contrasting sentiment has emerged regarding her opponent, Donald Trump. His health is now viewed as ""above average"" or ""excellent"" by 36% of voters, up from 33% in the earlier poll.

The awareness surrounding Clinton's potential medical issues is striking, with approximately 80% of respondents indicating they are informed about her health challenges. Observations about Clinton's appearance have also sparked concern; many believe she looks older than her actual age of 68, which has heightened scrutiny regarding her overall well-being.

Speculation surrounding Clinton's health has intensified in recent weeks. Reports indicate that she has been prescribed Coumadin, a medication commonly used to prevent blood clots, which has led to rampant speculation about the possibility of stroke-related issues. Additionally, there are inquiries into her use of Provigil, a drug typically prescribed for conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. Comments from her assistant have further fueled speculation, noting that Clinton requires naps and has exhibited moments of confusion.

Visual evidence has also contributed to the discourse on Clinton's health. Videos and photographs have surfaced showing her appearing to pass out or stumble during public appearances. There have been instances where she needed assistance to ascend stairs, and frequent images depict her holding onto aides or supporters for stability. These observations have not gone unnoticed, as concerns have been raised about the media's role in potentially suppressing footage, including a notable incident at the 9/11 Memorial where she appeared to lose her balance.

The impact of these health-related concerns is evident in the attendance at Clinton's rallies, which has been noticeably low. Observers speculate that this may be a strategic move to minimize public scrutiny regarding her health. By limiting the number of events and their visibility, the campaign may be attempting to manage the narrative surrounding her fitness for office.

Adding to the public's worries, Clinton's frequent coughing during speeches has drawn significant attention. This persistent issue has not only become a talking point among voters but has also raised alarms about her overall health and stamina as she campaigns for the presidency.

As the election approaches, the implications of these health concerns for Clinton's campaign are becoming increasingly pronounced. With a significant portion of the electorate expressing doubts about her health, the challenge for her campaign will be to address these issues effectively while continuing to engage voters on policy matters.

In a political landscape where perception can be as crucial as reality, Clinton's health has become more than just a personal matter; it is now a pivotal point of contention that could influence voter decisions. The campaign's ability to navigate these challenges will be critical as they seek to reassure the public and maintain momentum heading into the election.

As the days progress, it remains to be seen how Clinton's health will continue to shape the narrative of the election. With public opinion shifting and concerns mounting, the spotlight on her health is unlikely to dim anytime soon. For Clinton, addressing these issues head-on may be essential in regaining voter confidence and solidifying her position in a race that is becoming increasingly competitive.",-11.0,22.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,736.0,0.7586206896551724,0.029891304347826088

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle has stirred significant controversy with the release of her new book, ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which seeks to unveil alleged truths about Bill and Hillary Clinton. The book presents a series of claims that paint a troubling picture of Hillary Clinton's character and her treatment of those she deems inferior.

Kyle, who has a personal history with Bill Clinton dating back to their high school years, recounts their relationship and subsequent involvement after graduation. Her narrative is not just a personal account but also a critique of the couple's political attitudes and behaviors. Among the more shocking allegations is the claim that the Clintons have used racial epithets, raising questions about their views on race and class.

One particularly disturbing incident highlighted in the book involves Hillary Clinton making a negative remark about developmentally challenged children during an Easter egg hunt at the governor's mansion. This anecdote is part of a broader depiction of Hillary as someone who looks down on Arkansas residents, viewing them as ""ignorant hillbillies."" Kyle attributes this attitude to Hillary's middle-class upbringing in Illinois, suggesting that it has shaped her perceptions of those from different backgrounds.

Despite her apparent disdain for Arkansas, Hillary Clinton campaigned vigorously in New York, even claiming to be a lifelong Yankees fan—a statement that Kyle implies may lack authenticity. The book also touches on Bill Clinton's decision not to seek reelection in 1990, a choice that Kyle interprets as indicative of their dissatisfaction with life in Arkansas as they pursued broader national political ambitions.

""Hillary: The Other Woman"" is poised to provoke discussions about the Clintons' legacy and raise questions about the dynamics of their political journey, as Kyle's revelations challenge the public perception of one of America’s most prominent political couples.",-10.0,-22.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,343.0,-2.0,-0.0641399416909621

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a landmark decision, a Massachusetts judge has upheld a special law that permits black males to flee from police officers without the fear of legal repercussions. This ruling, which has now been sanctioned by the Supreme Court, cannot be appealed and has sparked a heated debate regarding public safety and law enforcement practices in the state.

The ruling is rooted in the concerns of some black Americans who express a profound fear of police officers. This apprehension has led to a tendency among individuals from this demographic to flee when approached by law enforcement. Under the new law, those who feel ""disproportionately"" targeted by police are now legally allowed to run, effectively changing the landscape of police interactions in Massachusetts.

Previously, fleeing from a police officer could be interpreted as ""reasonable suspicion,"" giving officers the grounds to detain individuals. However, this rationale is no longer applicable under the new ruling, which critics argue could compromise the ability of police to protect and serve the community effectively.

Concerns about public safety loom large in the wake of this decision. Law enforcement officials and community leaders have voiced apprehensions that the ruling may encourage more individuals to evade police, potentially leading to an increase in criminal activity. Critics of the decision suggest that it may inadvertently favor those with criminal intent, creating an environment where fleeing from law enforcement is not only permissible but perhaps even encouraged.

The implications of this ruling extend beyond the immediate legal landscape, raising questions about the relationship between law enforcement and marginalized communities. While the intent of the law may be to address systemic issues of racial profiling and discrimination, the potential consequences on public safety and community trust in law enforcement are significant.

As Massachusetts grapples with the fallout from this ruling, the conversation surrounding police reform, community safety, and the rights of individuals continues to evolve. Advocates for the law argue that it provides necessary protections for those who have historically faced discrimination and unjust treatment at the hands of law enforcement. However, the skepticism surrounding the ruling highlights a broader concern about balancing individual rights with the need for effective policing.

The ruling has ignited a passionate debate among community members, law enforcement, and policymakers, as they seek to navigate the complexities of race, justice, and public safety in Massachusetts. As the implications of this decision unfold, it remains to be seen how it will impact the dynamics between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The discussion is far from over, and the stakes are high as Massachusetts confronts the challenges posed by this unprecedented legal shift.",-13.0,12.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,499.0,0.6666666666666666,0.02404809619238477
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed a willingness to reevaluate her open migrant policy, acknowledging that she would change her approach if given the opportunity. Her comments come in the wake of a disappointing electoral performance by her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Berlin's recent elections, which highlighted a growing discontent with her administration's handling of refugee issues.

Merkel's reflections on her policies follow a significant shift in the political landscape of Germany, where anti-migrant sentiment has been on the rise. The emergence of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has capitalized on these sentiments, signals a growing divide in public opinion regarding immigration and integration. The Chancellor took responsibility for the CDU's poor election results, admitting that she had been unprepared for the scale of the 2015 refugee crisis, which saw a significant influx of asylum-seekers into the country.

Despite acknowledging the need for a potential policy shift, Merkel dismissed the likelihood of implementing major changes to her current approach. She firmly rejected calls from the Christian Social Union (CSU), her party's Bavarian counterpart, to impose a cap on migrant numbers at 200,000 and to prioritize Christian migrants over their Muslim counterparts. Merkel emphasized that such measures would contradict the fundamental principles of her party and the core values of Germany, which promote equality and non-discrimination.

The Chancellor's stance comes amidst rising tensions within her coalition, particularly with CSU leader Horst Seehofer, who has threatened to withdraw support for Merkel in the upcoming federal election due to her persistent commitment to a more inclusive migration policy. This discord within the ruling coalition reflects a broader societal unease, as concerns mount over the association of increased refugee intake with rising terrorism and crime.

The anti-migrant atmosphere has found resonance among segments of the German populace, leading to fears that Merkel's progressive policies may pose challenges for her party in future elections. The political ramifications of her decisions are becoming increasingly apparent as voters express their frustrations regarding immigration and its perceived implications for national security.

As Merkel navigates these complex issues, her leadership will be tested in the coming months. The electoral defeat in Berlin serves as a stark reminder of the shifting tides in German politics, where the balance between humanitarian responsibility and public sentiment is increasingly delicate. Merkel's commitment to her principles may face scrutiny as she seeks to maintain support within her coalition while also addressing the concerns of the electorate.

In summary, Merkel's recent comments reflect a moment of introspection regarding her administration's approach to migration. While she has acknowledged the need for potential changes, her steadfast rejection of specific policy alterations indicates a commitment to her foundational beliefs. As the political landscape evolves, the Chancellor will need to carefully navigate the challenges posed by rising anti-migrant sentiment and the pressures from within her own party. The outcome of this balancing act will be crucial as Germany prepares for the next federal election, where the stakes surrounding migration policy are higher than ever.",-14.0,3.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,576.0,0.15789473684210525,0.005208333333333333
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In a disturbing incident that has drawn attention to issues surrounding domestic violence and the treatment of women, Abdullah, a Somali asylum seeker residing in Sundsvall, Sweden, has been implicated in a violent assault against his pregnant wife. Known to local authorities for a history of violent crimes, Abdullah has reportedly been living on welfare benefits for the past five years while engaging in various offenses.

The recent assault occurred after Abdullah returned home from a night out. Prior to his arrival, he had demanded that his wife remove her niece, whom she was babysitting, from their home. Upon discovering that the niece was still present, Abdullah reacted with violence, physically assaulting his wife by kicking her in the head and stomach. The attack not only left her physically injured but also emotionally humiliated, as Abdullah compounded the assault by pouring beer over her, despite alcohol consumption being prohibited in Islamic teachings.

This incident raises critical questions about the adherence to religious principles among individuals who claim to follow them. The author of this report highlights the hypocrisy of Abdullah's actions in light of Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. The verse is often cited in discussions about domestic behavior within the context of Islam, yet Abdullah's actions starkly contrast with the teachings he purports to uphold.

The author expresses confusion over Abdullah's selective adherence to Islamic teachings, noting that while he appears to invoke religious doctrine when it suits him, his actions reflect a blatant disregard for the principles of respect and compassion that are central to the faith. This contradiction is troubling, particularly in a society that values equality and the protection of vulnerable individuals.

Abdullah's case is not just an isolated incident but part of a broader narrative concerning the challenges faced by asylum seekers and the complexities of integrating into a new culture. His history of violent behavior raises concerns about the adequacy of support systems in place for both asylum seekers and their families. The reliance on welfare benefits, combined with a pattern of criminal behavior, presents a challenging scenario for local authorities tasked with ensuring community safety and well-being.

As this situation unfolds, it serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for effective interventions aimed at preventing domestic violence and supporting victims. Local organizations and authorities are being called upon to address these issues more robustly, ensuring that individuals like Abdullah are held accountable for their actions while also providing necessary support to those affected by such violence.

The incident has sparked outrage within the community, with many calling for a reevaluation of how domestic violence cases are handled, particularly among vulnerable populations. As the conversation continues, it remains crucial to advocate for the rights and safety of victims, while also addressing the underlying issues that contribute to such violent behavior.",-28.0,-52.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,534.0,-2.888888888888889,-0.09737827715355805
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a contentious move, Pennsylvania Republicans are advocating for House Bill 29, which would permit non-residents to monitor polling places and challenge the eligibility of voters on Election Day. First proposed in June, the bill has sparked significant debate about its potential impact on the electoral process and voter rights.

The legislation, if passed, would enable individuals who do not reside in Pennsylvania to question voters’ eligibility, a provision that critics argue could lead to widespread disruptions at polling locations. Concerns have been raised that such challenges could create delays in the voting process, ultimately discouraging or preventing individuals from casting their ballots. This could be particularly problematic in a state where tight races are anticipated, as every vote could prove crucial.

Adam Gitlin from the Brennan Center for Justice has been vocal about the dangers posed by House Bill 29. He warns that the ability to challenge voters could lead to discriminatory practices, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups. Gitlin's insights highlight fears that the bill could foster an environment of chaos at polling places, where voters may feel intimidated or harassed by those questioning their right to vote.

Critics of the bill argue that it is a calculated effort to legitimize voter intimidation tactics, particularly those targeting individuals based on race or religion. This perspective is underscored by former President Donald Trump, who has publicly encouraged his supporters to monitor polling stations in Pennsylvania. Trump has claimed that the upcoming election could be rigged against him, further inflating tensions surrounding the electoral process.

The implications of House Bill 29 extend beyond Pennsylvania, with many observers suggesting that if the bill is enacted, similar strategies could be adopted in other states. The potential for voter intimidation to influence election outcomes raises alarms about the integrity of the democratic process. With a close race anticipated in the upcoming elections, there are growing concerns that the tactics outlined in the bill could sway results in favor of certain candidates, particularly those aligned with Trump.

In a further twist, an amendment to House Bill 29 has been proposed that would allow the legislation to take effect immediately upon passage, rather than the typical 60-day waiting period. This expedited timeline adds urgency to the debate, as supporters of the bill aim to implement these changes before the next election cycle.

As the discussion around House Bill 29 continues, the stakes for Pennsylvania voters remain high. The potential for non-residents to challenge voter eligibility raises fundamental questions about access to the polls and the rights of individuals to participate in the democratic process without fear of intimidation. Advocates for voter rights are mobilizing against the bill, emphasizing the need to protect the integrity of elections and ensure that all eligible voters can exercise their rights without undue interference.

As Pennsylvania stands on the brink of a pivotal election, the outcome of this legislative battle could have far-reaching consequences. The push for House Bill 29 not only reflects the current political climate but also serves as a bellwether for similar movements across the nation. The ongoing dialogue surrounding voter intimidation underscores the critical importance of safeguarding the electoral process and ensuring that democracy remains accessible to all.",-19.0,-11.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,596.0,-0.5,-0.018456375838926176

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an American Olympian fencer, has made history as the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a Hijab. Her groundbreaking participation has not only brought attention to the sport but has also highlighted the challenges faced by Muslim women in America. 

In a candid reflection, Muhammad has expressed feelings of insecurity while living in the United States. She recounted a troubling experience of being followed home from practice, a situation that underscores the fears many individuals face in their daily lives. Her story resonates with the broader context of racial and religious discrimination, as she emphasized the severity of racist incidents that have emerged, particularly in recent years. Muhammad pointed to the violence against Muslims and the negative rhetoric surrounding prominent Muslim figures, such as the Khan family, as indicative of the climate many face.

While some may argue that the U.S. is an ""Islamophobic"" country, the article presents a counterpoint, noting that hate crime rates against Jews are significantly higher. This statistic raises questions about the broader landscape of discrimination and challenges the narrative that Muslims are the most targeted group in America. 

In a controversial suggestion, the author questions why Muhammad does not consider relocating to a Muslim-majority country, positing that conditions for Muslims may be more favorable in the U.S. This perspective invites a deeper examination of the complexities surrounding identity, belonging, and safety for Muslim individuals living in America.

The article further contrasts the challenges faced by women in certain Muslim countries with Muhammad's experiences in the U.S. While she has encountered insecurity, her achievements as an athlete and role model present a stark difference to the oppressive conditions that some women endure elsewhere. Muhammad’s journey not only champions representation in sports but also serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing conversations about race, religion, and the experiences of Muslim women in America today.",-23.0,-9.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,364.0,-0.6923076923076923,-0.024725274725274724
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

Charlotte, NC - What began as a peaceful protest in Charlotte has devolved into violent chaos, following a shooting incident involving a black police officer and a black suspect. The escalation of events has left many questioning the motivations and actions of those participating in the riots, which have drawn widespread condemnation.

The protests, initially focused on addressing grievances related to police violence, quickly transformed into scenes of lawlessness. Eyewitness accounts reveal that rather than advocating for change, many rioters engaged in acts that can only be described as thuggish behavior. The label of ""thug"" is not one taken lightly; it is a term that encapsulates the discreditable actions witnessed during the riots. The rioters’ conduct has overshadowed the original intent of the protest, leading to a deep sense of frustration among those who believe in peaceful advocacy for justice.

One particularly alarming incident involved a police officer who was injured during the chaos. Instead of offering assistance or showing empathy, rioters reportedly mocked the officer, demonstrating a blatant disregard for human decency. This moment crystallizes the troubling reality that, in the heat of anger and frustration, some individuals have lost sight of the very values they claim to uphold. It raises critical questions about the responsibility of protesters to act in a manner that is respectful and constructive, rather than destructive and harmful.

The behavior exhibited by these rioters appears to stem from a broader issue of accountability. Many observers have expressed concern that a lack of responsibility and poor life choices among participants in the protests has contributed to the violence. The actions of the rioters not only undermine the message of the movement but also tarnish the image of those who genuinely seek reform and justice through peaceful means. The disconnection between the ideals of the protest and the reality of the riots is stark and troubling.

Moreover, the Black Lives Matter movement, which has garnered significant attention and support in recent years, faces scrutiny for what some perceive as hypocrisy. Advocates for change have pointed out that while the movement protests against police violence, similar violence persists within the community. This contradiction raises important questions about the focus and effectiveness of the movement. Are the leaders of this movement addressing the root causes of violence, or are they merely reacting to incidents involving law enforcement? The inability to reconcile these issues has led to growing frustration among both supporters and detractors of the movement.

Critics of the Black Lives Matter movement have generalized their sentiments to include all supporters, painting them with a broad brush of irresponsibility and violence. This generalization, while contentious, reflects a growing disillusionment with a segment of the movement that appears to prioritize confrontation over constructive dialogue. The perception that supporters are more inclined to engage in violence rather than seeking peaceful resolutions only serves to deepen the divide between communities and law enforcement.

The sentiment conveyed throughout the discourse surrounding these events is one of anger and disappointment. Many feel that the actions of the rioters have not only betrayed the principles of justice and equality but have also undermined the efforts of those who genuinely strive for change. The frustration is palpable, as it becomes increasingly clear that the path to meaningful reform is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the need for accountability among those who claim to fight for justice.

In conclusion, the riots in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding protests against police violence. What began as a call for justice has been marred by chaos and violence, leading to a disheartening reflection on the state of community relations and the effectiveness of movements like Black Lives Matter. As the dust settles, it is crucial for all involved to reflect on their actions and the messages they send, lest the cycle of violence continue to overshadow the pursuit of justice.",-83.0,-75.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,722.0,-2.6785714285714284,-0.1038781163434903
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In his final address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack Obama stirred controversy with remarks that many interpreted as advocating for a far-left, borderline socialist progressive agenda. Critics have long targeted Obama’s policies, including the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and an increased acceptance of refugees, but his recent comments have reignited debates about his vision for American freedom and global cooperation.

During the speech, Obama articulated a perspective that some have deemed provocative, suggesting that the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms in favor of a one-world order. This assertion has raised eyebrows among those who value individual liberties, as he emphasized that global security necessitates collaboration with international institutions like the United Nations. 

While Obama maintained that the right to self-defense is the only freedom that should remain untouchable, his willingness to entertain the idea of compromising other freedoms has drawn sharp criticism. Many Americans have voiced their discontent with his views, yet Obama stood firm, reflecting a sense of arrogance that has characterized his leadership style throughout his presidency.

The speech highlighted the growing divisiveness in Washington D.C., as Obama’s approach has often been at odds with traditional American values of independence and self-governance. Observers have likened his leadership to that of parents who preach certain values but fail to embody them, creating a disconnect between rhetoric and practice.

As Obama prepares to leave office, the implications of his views on freedom and global governance continue to resonate. His tenure has undeniably shifted the political landscape, leaving a legacy that many will scrutinize in the years to come. The debate over his far-left policies and their impact on American society is far from over, ensuring that his final address will be a topic of discussion long after he departs from the political stage.",13.0,22.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,349.0,2.0,0.06303724928366762
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the realm of professional football, two figures have recently found themselves sidelined, albeit for vastly different reasons. Tim Tebow, a well-respected former NFL quarterback, and Colin Kaepernick, a controversial figure known for his protests, are both not starting quarterbacks in the league. Their divergent paths have sparked discussions about respect, belief, and the manner in which one chooses to advocate for change.

Tebow, who has cultivated a reputation for his positive demeanor and commitment to his faith, has weighed in on Kaepernick’s highly publicized National Anthem protest. He emphasized the importance of standing for one’s beliefs ""the right way,"" suggesting that there are more respectful avenues for protest. Tebow’s comments reflect a belief that Kaepernick, now a high-paid bench player, is being disrespectful in his approach to activism. According to Tebow, if Kaepernick feels strongly about his cause, he should pursue his protests on his own time rather than during a national event meant to honor the country.

The discourse surrounding this issue extends beyond personal opinions, as the article argues that no one in the United States is truly oppressed. It posits that claims of oppression are often excuses for laziness, dismissing the struggles that many face in their daily lives. The author cites the presidency of Barack Obama as a pivotal example that contradicts assertions of widespread oppression, suggesting that if a person of color can ascend to the highest office in the land, the narrative of systemic oppression needs reevaluation.

Moreover, the article critiques Affirmative Action, asserting that it perpetuates the notion of victimhood rather than empowering individuals to rise on their own merits. This perspective aligns with Tebow’s own career trajectory, which has largely avoided negative press and focused on his aspirations, including hopes for a position with the New York Mets.

While Tebow is lauded for his commitment to maintaining a positive public image and concentrating on his professional endeavors, Kaepernick remains a polarizing figure. The contrasting narratives surrounding these two athletes highlight the complexities of activism, respect, and the interpretation of freedom of expression in America.

In a world where public figures often face scrutiny for their actions, Tebow’s approach serves as a counterpoint to Kaepernick’s methods. While Tebow champions a more traditional form of respect and belief, Kaepernick’s protests have ignited conversations about race, justice, and the responsibilities of athletes in the public eye. As the debate continues, one thing remains clear: the paths of these two men, though divergent, will continue to evoke strong opinions and discussions about the nature of protest and the meaning of respect in contemporary society.",-6.0,11.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,512.0,0.6470588235294118,0.021484375
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

As discussions surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border wall continue, officials emphasize its role as a vital national security measure that extends beyond merely curbing illegal immigration. The historical context echoes in the construction of such barriers, reminiscent of China’s Great Wall, which was originally erected to fend off foreign invaders rather than to restrict the movement of people.

The current situation along the Southern Border is alarming, particularly given the significant influence of drug cartels in Mexico. These criminal organizations not only contribute to a high death toll in the region but also present an ongoing threat to U.S. security. With an unsecured border, there are rising concerns that terrorist groups, including ISIS, may exploit vulnerabilities to infiltrate the United States.

Recent events have intensified these worries. Reports have surfaced regarding eight Syrian nationals who attempted to illegally cross into the U.S. from Mexico. This incident, occurring in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, has raised red flags among security experts. Although there have been claims that these individuals were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, Border Patrol has yet to confirm these reports.

Hector Garza, President of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, has expressed apprehensions shared by many agents on the ground about the potential for Syrian crossings. He pointed out a troubling trend: the majority of individuals caught illegally entering the U.S. are not deported, raising further questions about the effectiveness of current border enforcement strategies.

The urgency for stronger border security measures has never been more pronounced. Advocates for enhanced security argue that the consequences of a porous border could be catastrophic, allowing not only illegal immigrants but also potential threats to national safety to enter the country unimpeded. The need for robust support for border patrol efforts is echoed across various sectors, with many calling for comprehensive strategies to address the multifaceted challenges posed by border security.

In the political arena, a Presidential candidate has emerged, championing the cause of fortified border security measures. This candidate's platform underscores a growing recognition of the complexities surrounding immigration and national security, emphasizing that a secure border is essential for safeguarding the nation.

As the debate continues, the border wall stands at the forefront of discussions about national security, reflecting a broader understanding that the implications of an unsecured border extend far beyond immigration alone.",-13.0,-25.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,447.0,-1.4705882352941178,-0.05592841163310962

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

A recent rally drew a crowd of enthusiastic Haitians who voiced their positive experiences and sentiments towards former President Donald Trump. Attendees cheered as they shared personal stories, highlighting a community that feels overlooked by past political leaders.

Many in the audience expressed their discontent with the Clintons, who they accused of neglecting Haiti after receiving substantial donations for aid efforts. Reports indicate that the Clintons have become unpopular among Haitians, primarily due to their perceived mishandling of aid intended for the country. Audience members alleged that funds meant to support Haiti were mismanaged, benefiting Washington lobbyists rather than the Haitian people.

Further fueling the criticism, some attendees claimed that Hillary Clinton obstructed efforts to raise Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5, a move they argue would have significantly improved living conditions for many. As the crowd directed their ire towards Hillary Clinton, they continued to express admiration for Trump, who was met with applause and cheers.

Interestingly, media representatives covering the event left early, reportedly finding no negative coverage of Trump to report. Their departure was met with disdain from the crowd, with some describing the media's exit as ""scurrying like rats.""

Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate of increasing concern over terrorism and cultural integration, a recent proposal by former U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a ban on Muslim immigration until a better understanding of terrorism is achieved has ignited discussions across the globe, including in Australia. While Trump's proposal has faced significant backlash, particularly from Democrats who label it as racist, the underlying issues it raises merit a more nuanced examination.

Critics of Trump's stance argue that it is rooted in racism; however, this perspective may overlook a crucial distinction between race and religion. The author of this discussion posits that while Islam, as a religion, can indeed be radicalized, this does not equate to a blanket judgment against individuals based solely on their faith. Rather, it highlights a need for a more informed dialogue about the implications of immigration policies in relation to national security and societal values.

A recent poll conducted in Australia reveals a notable shift in public opinion regarding Muslim immigration. Support for a ban has surged to 49%, a significant increase from just 28% recorded last October. This dramatic rise indicates that concerns surrounding terrorism and the integration of Muslim communities into Australian society are resonating with a substantial portion of the population. Furthermore, the poll shows that 48% of voters are in favor of a national debate on immigration, reflecting a desire for open discussion on this contentious issue.

The sentiments expressed in the poll cut across political lines, illustrating a widespread apprehension about the implications of Muslim immigration. Among Coalition voters, 60% support the ban, while 40% of Labour voters and 34% of Green voters share similar sentiments. This cross-party support suggests that fears regarding terrorism and the perceived challenges of integrating Muslim immigrants into Australian values are not confined to a single political ideology.

Two-thirds of Australians believe that populist senator Pauline Hanson addresses topics that other politicians tend to avoid, indicating a growing appetite for frank discussions about immigration and its associated challenges. Many supporters of a ban cite fears of terrorism and concerns about whether Muslim immigrants can fully embrace and integrate into Australian values as their primary motivations. These issues have become increasingly pressing as global events continue to shape public perceptions of safety and cultural cohesion.

The pollster overseeing the research expressed surprise at the significant level of support for the ban, suggesting that it reflects broader societal views that may have been previously underestimated. As Australia grapples with its identity and values in an increasingly complex world, the conversation surrounding immigration is likely to become more prominent.

In the face of dissenting opinions, the author criticizes the approach taken by figures such as Hillary Clinton, who often dismiss opposing views. Instead, the author advocates for a recognition of differing perspectives, suggesting that constructive dialogue is essential for addressing the concerns that underpin the calls for a ban on Muslim immigration.

As the Australian public continues to engage with these pressing issues, the need for a balanced and informed discussion becomes ever more critical. Whether through national debates or local forums, the opportunity to explore the complexities of immigration, national security, and cultural integration is essential for fostering understanding and unity within the diverse fabric of Australian society. The rise in support for a ban on Muslim immigration serves as a potent reminder of the challenges that lie ahead, and the importance of addressing them with sensitivity and openness.",2.0,10.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,644.0,0.45454545454545453,0.015527950310559006

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on

In a shocking turn of events, a chaotic fight erupted on a city street, drawing attention and concern from local residents. The incident, which has since been described as disturbing, escalated dramatically when an unknown individual threw a Molotov cocktail at the fighters, igniting a fire that added to the already tense atmosphere. Eyewitnesses reported a scene of confusion, with people running for safety and fearing for their lives as cars sped by, narrowly avoiding the chaos.

Buzzfeed has since claimed that the description of the crime and its victims is inaccurate, but the original source of the report has disputed this assertion. The conflicting narratives have sparked a dialogue about the nature of violence and the responsibilities of bystanders in such chaotic situations.

As the flames flickered in the background, many observers were left questioning the mentality that would lead someone to resort to using a Molotov cocktail during a street fight. This act of aggression not only endangered those involved in the altercation but also posed a significant risk to innocent bystanders who were simply trying to navigate the street.

Reflecting on societal norms of the past, it is worth noting that there was once a time when bystanders would intervene to protect those in danger rather than standing idly by or, worse, filming the event for social media. The shift in behavior raises concerns about modern priorities, where the instinct to capture a moment on camera often supersedes the instinct to help those in need.

Critics of this trend argue that the prevalence of smartphones and social media has fostered a culture where violence is not only witnessed but recorded, often for the sake of entertainment or social clout. This behavior detracts from the fundamental human instinct to care for one another, leading to a society where individuals feel more like spectators than active participants in their communities.

In light of this disturbing incident, there is a growing call for a return to a more compassionate approach to conflict resolution. Rather than resorting to violence or passively observing, it is imperative that individuals reclaim the responsibility to look out for one another.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- A border wall is deemed necessary for securing access points into America and preventing illegal immigration.

Luna County, New Mexico, is currently on high alert after law enforcement officials conducted a traffic stop involving an undocumented woman who has been described as an ""Islamic refugee."" The incident has raised significant concerns about national security, particularly regarding illegal immigration and potential threats to the region.

During the traffic stop, authorities discovered that the woman possessed plans for a nearby gas pipeline. This revelation has sparked fears that she may have been scouting the area for malicious purposes, although her intentions remain unclear. The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, along with U.S. Border Patrol, has since investigated the area but reported no immediate threats following their inquiries.

The remote location of the pipeline has led to speculation that the woman might have been planning future terror attacks rather than an immediate one. The presence of an undocumented Muslim woman in a border county has further intensified these concerns, prompting discussions about the implications of illegal immigration on national security.

Historical reports have indicated that the U.S. faces potential threats from individuals crossing the southern border. A 2015 report by Judicial Watch highlighted the collaboration between Mexican cartels and terror organizations, which allegedly smuggle individuals from terror-affected nations into the United States. Additionally, a 2017 report from the same organization noted the illegal crossings of Mexico-based Islamic terror groups into the U.S., with the aim of identifying potential targets for attacks.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call for Congress to approve funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Advocates argue that the construction of a southern border wall is essential for preventing entry by terrorists and drug cartels, thereby securing the nation from foreign threats. The argument is bolstered by the assertion that many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not solely from Mexico, and some may receive support from the Mexican government.

The ongoing situation underscores the belief that terrorists could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the southern border, particularly as they may originate from countries that lack adequate traveler vetting. As law enforcement continues to monitor the situation, the need for effective measures to secure the nation remains a pressing issue.

The events in Luna County serve as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration and national security, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive solutions to address these challenges. As investigations continue, local and federal authorities remain vigilant in their efforts to ensure the safety of the community and the country at large.",-44.0,-35.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,466.0,-2.0588235294117645,-0.07510729613733906

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In the high-stakes world of the NFL, where winning is often the singular focus, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out not just for his athletic prowess but for his unwavering commitment to faith and service. Wilson openly emphasizes his love for God and his desire to help others, aiming to leave behind a legacy rooted in true joy.

On the field, Wilson is a fierce competitor, driven by a singular goal: victory. However, off the field, his mission transforms into one of promoting joy and peace, grounded in his faith and the good choices he makes. This duality of purpose defines Wilson's approach to life, as he seeks to balance the demands of professional football with his deeper convictions.

Despite the NFL’s advisory to its players against discussing their faith publicly, Wilson has found creative ways to express his beliefs through his actions. His dedication to living out his values is evident in his interactions with fans, teammates, and the community. This commitment to serving others goes beyond mere words; it is a reflection of his character and the principles he holds dear.

Wilson prioritizes his life in a way that many might find unconventional in the competitive arena of professional sports. He places God first, followed closely by family and friends, with football taking a backseat. This hierarchy, according to Wilson, leads to positive outcomes not just for himself but for those around him. It’s a philosophy that contrasts sharply with the experiences of some public figures who, after achieving success, appear to abandon their core values. 

The article critiques this phenomenon, noting the prevalence of corruption and deception in leadership today. In an era where integrity can often be overshadowed by ambition, Wilson’s steadfast adherence to his principles serves as a refreshing reminder of the importance of staying true to one’s values. His example raises questions about the societal shift regarding the importance of serving others and promoting happiness over personal gain.

Frustration is palpable regarding the NFL's stance on faith discussions, especially when juxtaposed with the league's tolerance of disrespect towards the country. This disparity raises eyebrows and invites criticism, as many wonder why players are discouraged from expressing their beliefs while other forms of expression are permitted. The inconsistency in these policies reflects a broader cultural conversation about the role of faith in public life and the responsibilities of those in positions of influence.

Wilson's approach to life and football suggests a path that prioritizes joy and service over the relentless pursuit of success. His focus on faith as the cornerstone of his life challenges the narrative that often accompanies professional athletes. In a world where many are quick to compromise their values for fame and fortune, Wilson’s commitment to his beliefs stands as a testament to the power of integrity and purpose.

In conclusion, the dangers posed by those who oppose good are increasingly evident in today's society. The contrast between Wilson’s values and those of some public figures serves as a clarion call for authenticity and moral courage. As he continues to navigate the complexities of life as a professional athlete, Russell Wilson remains a beacon of hope, demonstrating that true joy and fulfillment come from serving others and living a life grounded in faith. His legacy, one that transcends the football field, inspires countless individuals to prioritize what truly matters: love, service, and the pursuit of goodness in all aspects of life.",79.0,88.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,657.0,3.52,0.1339421613394216
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a poignant address to Italy's press, Pope Francis has sharply criticized the role of fear-based media, drawing parallels between journalism founded on gossip and rumors and acts of terrorism. The Pope's remarks come at a time when the media landscape is increasingly influenced by sensationalism and nationalism, which he argues can have destructive effects on society.

During his address, Pope Francis underscored the profound responsibility that journalists hold, stating that their words possess the power to ""kill a person with your tongue."" This stark reminder highlights the potential consequences of spreading misinformation and fear, particularly in a climate where stereotypes and negative portrayals of marginalized groups, such as migrants, can lead to societal harm.

The Pope's comments resonate with ongoing discussions about the impact of certain media outlets on public perception and political discourse. Notably, Fox News has been characterized as a ""fear network,"" contributing to a culture of anxiety and alarmism. Critics argue that its coverage often amplifies fears surrounding crime and terrorism, influencing public figures, including former President Donald Trump, and shaping political narratives that thrive on fear rather than facts.

Despite a notable decrease in crime rates across the United States, polls reveal a troubling trend: many Americans report heightened fears regarding terrorism and crime. This disconnect between actual crime statistics and public perception can be attributed, in part, to the relentless coverage of mass shootings and protests, which have fostered a pervasive sense of disorder and insecurity.

Pope Francis's critique of fear-based journalism serves as a call to action for journalists to reflect on their role in shaping societal narratives. By perpetuating stereotypes and fostering fear, media outlets can contribute to a cycle of distrust and division, particularly against vulnerable populations. The Pope's emphasis on the need for responsible journalism highlights the importance of truth and compassion in media reporting.

As the media continues to navigate a complex landscape, the challenge remains for journalists to prioritize integrity over sensationalism. The Pope's message serves as a reminder that the power of the press should be wielded with care, as it holds the potential to either uplift or harm communities.

In conclusion, Pope Francis's address to Italy's press sheds light on the pressing issue of fear-based media and its impact on society. By urging journalists to be mindful of their influence, he advocates for a media landscape that fosters understanding rather than fear, ultimately promoting a more compassionate and informed public discourse.",-56.0,-47.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,472.0,-2.9375,-0.09957627118644068
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

In a highly anticipated first general election debate, CNN polling has declared Hillary Clinton the winner, marking a significant moment in the contentious race for the presidency. The debate, which covered critical topics such as the Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and Donald Trump's tax returns, showcased the stark differences between the two candidates.

While CNN's post-debate poll indicated that Clinton garnered 62% of the support compared to Trump's 27%, several snap polls from various sources, including TIME Magazine, Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville, have indicated a different narrative, with many declaring Trump the debate winner. This divergence in polling results has sparked discussions about potential bias, particularly regarding CNN's sample pool, which some critics argue leaned Democratic.

Following the debate, Trump took to Twitter to express his gratitude to supporters for their favorable snap poll responses. In contrast, Clinton has yet to comment on the debate's aftermath or the polling results. Despite Clinton's declared win by CNN, the mixed results from other polls suggest that the debate may not significantly sway voter turnout as the election approaches.

During the debate, Trump raised concerns about a defective microphone, which he claimed hindered his performance. He also suggested that he should have addressed Bill Clinton's past infidelities, indicating that he felt there were missed opportunities to challenge his opponent more directly.

As the election nears, both candidates face the pressing challenge of influencing undecided voters. The stakes are high, and with limited time remaining, every debate and public appearance could prove crucial.

Adding to the tension, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted at an ""October surprise"" release that could potentially impact Clinton's campaign in the coming weeks. With the political landscape shifting rapidly, both candidates will need to navigate these developments carefully as they seek to solidify their support ahead of Election Day.",18.0,16.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,377.0,1.2307692307692308,0.042440318302387266
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

While Clinton's supporters may have perceived her performance favorably, polling from focus groups suggests a more complex narrative regarding the debate's outcome.

In a focus group conducted by CNN, which included Florida voters, the results were overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, with an 18-2 split. Similarly, a focus group led by Frank Luntz for Fox News showed a 16-6 advantage for Clinton, indicating that many viewers believed she performed better against Trump. However, the dynamics of the debate revealed challenges for both candidates. Luntz noted that Trump struggled with his comments regarding his taxes but appeared to regain his footing when the conversation shifted to Clinton’s email scandal.

Despite these favorable focus group results for Clinton, Trump faced significant backlash during the debate, particularly when he attempted to explain his controversial questioning of Barack Obama's birthplace. This moment may have contributed to mixed reactions among viewers, as an alternate poll indicated a strikingly different perspective, showing Trump winning the debate with a staggering 92% to 8%.

Clinton's declaration of victory on social media shortly after the debate sparked a wave of negative reactions, with the hashtag #TrumpWon trending as users expressed their dissent. Critics have also pointed out Clinton's decision to avoid media interactions in the aftermath of the debate, raising questions about her confidence in her performance and messaging.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the debate's aftermath highlights the complexities of public perception and the impact of social media on political discourse.

Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted for a second consecutive night in Charlotte following the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, a tragic incident that has ignited outrage and unrest in the community. The protests, which began peacefully, quickly escalated into chaos, leading to critical injuries and a contentious battle between demonstrators and law enforcement.

The initial gathering of approximately 1,000 protesters took to the streets with signs bearing messages such as “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” expressing solidarity and demanding justice for Scott. However, tensions escalated significantly when riot police were deployed, resulting in a violent confrontation that left one civilian critically injured after being shot in the head.

As details surrounding the shooting emerged, conflicting narratives began to surface. Police officials claimed that the shooter was a civilian, a statement that was met with skepticism from numerous eyewitnesses. Todd Zimmer, one eyewitness, took to Twitter to voice his concerns, asserting that the city was not being truthful about the incident. His comments echoed the sentiments of many who were present, raising questions about the actions of law enforcement during the protests.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, corroborated Zimmer’s account, stating that the shots he heard did not resemble those of a typical firearm. His observations added to the growing belief among protesters and bystanders that the gunfire was not from a civilian, but rather from police officers who were present at the scene.

Eyewitnesses described the gunfire as significantly louder than what one would expect from standard gunfire, further fueling speculation that law enforcement was responsible for the shooting of the protester. As the situation intensified, police declared the protest a riot, a move that many protesters viewed as an attempt to justify the use of force against the demonstrators.

In response to the escalating chaos, law enforcement deployed tear gas against retreating protesters, a tactic that only heightened tensions and led to further unrest within the crowd. The City of Charlotte quickly took to Twitter to assert that the shooting was a civilian incident, a statement that starkly contradicted the accounts of those who witnessed the events unfold. 

Additional eyewitness reports, including statements from clergy and other individuals present during the protests, also refuted the police narrative. Many expressed disbelief at the official account, insisting that police were responsible for the shooting. The growing chorus of dissenting voices has raised significant concerns regarding transparency and accountability within law enforcement.

As the protests continued into the night, community leaders called for calm but also demanded a thorough investigation into the events surrounding Kenneth L. Scott's death and the subsequent violence during the protests. The situation remains fluid, with many in Charlotte calling for justice and answers in the wake of a tragedy that has left the community reeling.

The tragic death of Kenneth L. Scott has become a rallying point for those advocating against police violence and systemic injustice. As protests continue, the city of Charlotte faces mounting pressure to address the concerns raised by its citizens and to ensure accountability for the actions of law enforcement during this tumultuous period.

The protests in Charlotte reflect a broader national conversation about police conduct and community relations, with many individuals expressing frustration over perceived injustices and a lack of accountability. The situation is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by communities across the country as they grapple with issues of race, policing, and civil rights.

As the investigation into the shooting of the protester unfolds, many are left questioning the narrative put forth by law enforcement and calling for an honest and transparent examination of the events that transpired. The voices of the community are growing louder, demanding justice not only for Kenneth L. Scott but for all victims of police violence.

The coming days will likely see continued demonstrations as the community seeks answers and justice for those affected by the tragic events in Charlotte. The resilience of the protesters and their determination to seek accountability highlights the ongoing struggle for civil rights and justice in America.

In the wake of these events, it is clear that the community of Charlotte is at a crossroads, facing difficult questions about policing, accountability, and the right to protest. As the nation watches, the outcome of these protests will have significant implications for the future of community-police relations in Charlotte and beyond.

As the situation develops, it remains imperative for all parties involved to engage in constructive dialogue and to seek a resolution that addresses the concerns of the community while ensuring the safety and well-being of all citizens. The events in Charlotte serve as a poignant reminder of the importance of listening to the voices of the community and working together to create a more just and equitable society.

In conclusion, the protests in Charlotte following the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott have sparked a significant outcry for justice and accountability. As conflicting narratives emerge and tensions rise, the community remains steadfast in its demand for answers and change. The road ahead is uncertain, but the resolve of the protesters is clear: they will not be silenced until justice is served.",-74.0,-68.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,958.0,-2.0,-0.0709812108559499
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Republican nominee Donald Trump finds himself at the center of a storm of scrutiny regarding his foreign policy, particularly in relation to Russia. Critics have raised alarms over what appears to be a troubling alignment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting that Trump's connections to the Kremlin could significantly influence his approach to international relations if he were to regain the presidency.

One of the most pressing concerns is Trump's inner circle, which includes several individuals with ties to the Russian government. This network of advisors has raised eyebrows, especially considering the support Trump has received from Russian state media and intelligence services. These connections have led many to question the integrity of his foreign policy and whether it would prioritize American interests or those of foreign powers.

Despite Trump's assertions that he has no business ties to Russia, an investigation by ABC News has uncovered a web of connections that contradicts this claim. The investigation reveals that Trump has numerous dealings with Russian interests, which amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. This financial entanglement raises significant questions about the potential conflicts of interest that could arise should Trump assume office once again.

Among Trump's notable business dealings is the hosting of the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow, an event that not only showcased his brand but also solidified his presence in the Russian market. Additionally, he has sold real estate to a considerable number of Russian buyers, further intertwining his financial interests with those of Russian nationals. These transactions have led to concerns that Trump may be more invested in maintaining and growing his business relationships in Russia than in formulating a foreign policy that serves the interests of the United States.

Compounding these worries are the activities of Russian oligarchs, who have long been known to leverage their wealth for influence and power. Many of these oligarchs, who accrued their fortunes through the privatization of state assets in the post-Soviet era, have used Trump properties to launder money. Described as self-entitled and primarily focused on personal wealth, these individuals exhibit little regard for cultural or social justice issues. Their financial dealings with Trump raise serious ethical questions about the potential for corruption and the influence of foreign money in American politics.

Adding another layer of complexity to this situation is the fact that the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on several Russian oligarchs in 2014. If Trump were to be elected president, there are concerns that these sanctions could be lifted, thereby allowing these wealthy individuals to continue enriching themselves without consequence. Such a move could not only undermine U.S. foreign policy but also signal a troubling willingness to prioritize personal and financial interests over national security.

The implications of Trump's business dealings extend beyond mere ethics; they pose a direct challenge to the integrity of U.S. foreign policy regarding Russia. Critics argue that Trump's financial entanglements could lead to a presidency that is more aligned with the interests of Russian elites than with the needs of the American people. This potential conflict of interest raises significant concerns about how Trump would navigate complex international issues, particularly those involving Russia.

As the election draws nearer, it is imperative for voters to consider the ramifications of Trump's connections with Russian interests. The suggestion that he would prioritize personal gain over national interests is a troubling prospect that warrants serious examination. With the stakes higher than ever, the question remains: can the American public trust a leader whose financial ties to foreign powers may compromise their interests?

In conclusion, Donald Trump's foreign policy and business dealings with Russian interests present a multifaceted challenge that could have far-reaching consequences for the United States. As investigations continue to uncover the extent of his connections to the Kremlin, voters must grapple with the implications of electing a leader who may be more beholden to foreign powers than to the American people. The upcoming election serves as a critical juncture for the nation, one that could determine the future of U.S. foreign policy and its relationship with Russia.",27.0,23.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,758.0,0.8518518518518519,0.030343007915567283
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing a potential impeachment as state legislators ramp up their investigation into his involvement in the controversial George Washington Bridge closure, an event that has sparked widespread outrage and legal scrutiny. The closure, which is now infamously known as “Bridgegate,” was part of a political retribution scheme that has drawn the attention of both state and federal authorities.

A judge has recently ordered Christie to produce personal emails that are related to the ongoing investigation into the scandal. This decision underscores the seriousness of the allegations against him and the potential legal ramifications that could follow. The investigation has already implicated Christie in a plot that caused significant traffic disruptions and is linked to at least one death, raising the stakes for the governor as he navigates these tumultuous waters.

The decision to pursue impeachment now lies in the hands of Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. If Prieto approves moving forward, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would initiate the impeachment process. This procedural step is crucial, as a majority of the 80-member Assembly would be required to vote in favor of impeachment. Should the Assembly take that step, a subsequent Senate trial would necessitate a two-thirds vote for conviction.

Christie’s predicament is further complicated by his role as the transition team chairperson for Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. His endorsement of Trump in March 2016 marked a significant pivot in his political trajectory, aligning himself with the controversial figure amidst a backdrop of mounting legal troubles. This connection raises questions about how the impeachment proceedings may affect his relationship with Trump, especially as both navigate the political landscape during a contentious election cycle.

Despite the gravity of the situation, Christie has maintained his innocence regarding the Bridgegate scandal. Shortly after his re-election, he publicly denied any knowledge of the events surrounding the bridge closure during a press conference. However, revelations have since surfaced that Christie was informed of the situation by aides during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013, yet he reportedly took no action at that time. This contradiction has fueled skepticism and criticism from both political opponents and constituents.

As the investigation progresses, the implications for Christie's future in politics are becoming increasingly uncertain. His political career, once viewed as promising, is now marred by the specter of impeachment and the fallout from the Bridgegate scandal. The outcome of the legislative inquiry could not only determine his fate as governor but also cast a long shadow over his political ambitions moving forward.

The Bridgegate scandal has become a defining moment in Christie’s tenure as governor, raising significant ethical questions and challenging his leadership. As legislators deliberate on the potential impeachment, the eyes of the nation remain fixed on New Jersey, where the outcome could set a precedent for similar political controversies in the future.

In the coming weeks, the political landscape in New Jersey may shift dramatically, depending on the actions of the Assembly and the judiciary.

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In the high-stakes arena of political debates, candidates often find themselves under scrutiny, not only for their policies but also for the veracity of their statements. A striking moment occurred during the September 2015 Republican primary debate when Donald Trump asserted that he never lobbied Jeb Bush for casino gambling, confidently stating, “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” This bold claim, however, raises significant questions about the integrity of Trump’s statements and the implications of potential perjury.

The assertion made by Trump during the debate stands in stark contrast to his previous admissions regarding his interest in casino gambling, particularly during a deposition in 2007. In that legal setting, Trump openly acknowledged his pursuit of casino gambling opportunities in Florida. This contradiction is not merely a political talking point but rather a critical issue that could suggest a pattern of dishonesty on Trump’s part.

The debate exchange between Trump and Bush highlighted a clear conflict over whether Trump had indeed lobbied for gambling interests in Florida. Jeb Bush maintained that Trump had sought to influence his views on casino gambling, a claim that directly counters Trump’s assertion that he had no such intentions. This discrepancy raises the question: if Trump’s claim during the debate is indeed false, does it amount to lying under oath, given his earlier deposition?

When comparing Trump’s statements during the debate to his deposition testimony, the inconsistencies become glaringly apparent. The stark difference between the two accounts not only undermines Trump’s credibility but also poses broader implications regarding the standards of honesty expected from public officials. The seriousness of this issue cannot be overstated, especially when considering the historical context of political accountability.

The article draws a poignant parallel to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced severe consequences for lying under oath. Clinton’s impeachment was rooted in his denial of extramarital affairs, a scandal that rocked the nation and raised questions about the integrity of the presidency. In light of Trump’s conflicting statements, one must ask whether a double standard exists in political accountability. While Clinton faced scrutiny and impeachment for his dishonesty, Trump’s apparent fabrications seem to receive a different level of scrutiny, raising concerns about the consistency of moral and ethical expectations in political leadership.

The implications of Trump’s tendency to distort the truth extend beyond mere political posturing; they pose a tangible danger to national safety. In a world where trust in leadership is paramount, the ability of a president to communicate honestly with the public and Congress is essential for maintaining stability and security. The potential for misinformation to sway public opinion and policy decisions is a serious concern, one that should not be taken lightly.

In light of these revelations and the patterns of behavior exhibited by Trump, the article concludes with a compelling call to action. The author urges Congress to take a stand against what they perceive as Trump’s alleged crimes and to consider impeachment as a necessary course of action. The gravity of the situation demands accountability from those in power, and the author contends that allowing such behavior to go unchecked could have dire consequences for the nation.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the importance of honesty and integrity in leadership remains a fundamental principle. The discrepancies in Trump’s statements regarding his lobbying for casino gambling not only reflect on his character but also raise critical questions about the standards to which all public officials should be held. The discourse surrounding these issues will undoubtedly shape the future of American politics and the expectations of its leaders.",-29.0,-17.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,701.0,-0.7083333333333334,-0.024251069900142655
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many individuals watched the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN, with some turning it into a drinking game.

In a politically charged atmosphere, many viewers tuned in to the recent 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN, with some turning the event into an unconventional drinking game. However, this lighthearted approach has drawn serious warnings from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who cautioned that drinking every time former President Donald Trump lies could lead to alcohol poisoning.

Murthy has a history of warning against drinking games during political debates, particularly with Republican candidates. His concerns are not unfounded; in 2012, approximately 70,000 incidents related to alcohol poisoning were reported in the United States. The Surgeon General reiterated these warnings before the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on September 26, 2016, emphasizing the dangers of excessive drinking in response to political rhetoric.

A recent study by Politico highlighted the frequency of falsehoods during Trump's speeches, reporting that he told 87 lies over a five-day span from September 15 to September 20, averaging a lie every three minutes and 15 seconds. Based on this average, it is estimated that Trump likely told about 28 lies during the recent CNN debate. This staggering number raises significant concerns about the potential risks associated with drinking games designed around his statements.

In light of these statistics, Murthy has urged viewers to exercise caution. He noted that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related issues following the debate, indicating a serious acknowledgment of the risks involved. The Surgeon General’s advice is clear: viewers should drink responsibly during upcoming debates. He humorously suggested ""baby sips"" for every lie attributed to Trump, a reminder that while engaging with political discourse can be entertaining, it should not come at the expense of personal safety.

As the election season heats up, viewers are encouraged to enjoy the debates but to do so with a mindset focused on health and responsibility. The combination of political fervor and drinking games can lead to dangerous situations, and Murthy’s warnings serve as an important reminder for all participants and observers alike.",-17.0,-6.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,385.0,-0.4,-0.015584415584415584
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, mainstream media outlets have widely declared Hillary Clinton the winner, praising her performance and articulating a strong case for her candidacy. However, a contrasting narrative has emerged from online platforms, where many users expressed a different sentiment. Notably, the hashtag #TrumpWon surged in popularity on Twitter, indicating a significant portion of the online audience felt that Donald Trump had the upper hand during the debate.

The hashtag's rise to prominence sparked discussions across social media, with many users rallying behind the sentiment that Trump had outperformed Clinton. Trump himself took notice of the trending hashtag, acknowledging it in a tweet that further fueled the online chatter. Despite the media's portrayal of the debate, the digital landscape painted a different picture, creating a dichotomy between traditional journalism and social media narratives.

Interestingly, the origins of the #TrumpWon hashtag have raised eyebrows, as it has been traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. This revelation has brought to light the tactics employed by Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who has been known to utilize cyber-trolls and bloggers to further his political agenda. These operatives are often engaged in disinformation campaigns designed to sow discord and amplify divisions within American society.

The presence of Russian trolls on social media platforms is not a new phenomenon. Reports indicate that these individuals have been instrumental in promoting pro-Trump propaganda, aiming to influence public opinion and manipulate the political landscape in the United States. Analysts suggest that Putin's ultimate goal is to leverage these efforts to persuade Trump into lifting economic sanctions that have been imposed on Russia.

Former bloggers who have worked in this environment have described their experiences as harsh and tightly controlled, shedding light on the oppressive conditions that characterize such operations. Their accounts underscore the need for vigilance when navigating the online discourse surrounding political events.

As the debate continues over who truly won the recent face-off, experts caution against placing undue trust in online polls and engaging with the narratives pushed by trolls. The disparity between media interpretations and social media trends highlights the complexities of modern political communication, reminding audiences to critically evaluate the sources of information they encounter.

Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics company controlled by billionaire Peter Thiel, is facing a federal lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Labor, which alleges the company engaged in discriminatory hiring practices against Asian applicants. The lawsuit, filed recently, raises serious questions about the hiring processes at Palantir, particularly for engineering intern positions.

According to the allegations, out of 130 applicants for these positions, a striking 73% were Asian. However, the hiring outcomes reveal a concerning disparity: only four Asian applicants were ultimately hired, in stark contrast to 17 non-Asian candidates who secured positions. This dramatic difference has led the Department of Labor to suggest that the hiring results are statistically improbable, estimating the likelihood of such an outcome at approximately one in a billion.

The implications of this lawsuit are significant, especially for a company like Palantir, which has established itself as a leader in the tech industry. The Department of Labor has underscored the responsibilities of federal contractors to maintain non-discriminatory hiring practices, emphasizing the need for fairness and equality in employment opportunities.

Peter Thiel, the co-founder and chairman of Palantir, is no stranger to controversy. A well-known Republican donor and supporter of former President Donald Trump, Thiel has made headlines for various reasons over the years. Notably, he gained notoriety this year for funding Hulk Hogan's successful lawsuit against Gawker, which ultimately led to the media company's bankruptcy. This legal battle highlighted Thiel's willingness to engage in high-profile litigation to protect his interests.

In addition to his business ventures and legal battles, Thiel made history as the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention. During his speech, he advocated for individual identity and expressed criticism of government incompetence. Despite the positive reception of his address, the Republican Party subsequently adopted an anti-LGBT platform, which stood in stark contrast to Thiel's views and experiences.

As the lawsuit unfolds, Palantir has firmly denied the allegations of discrimination. The company has announced plans to defend itself vigorously against the claims made by the Department of Labor. This legal challenge comes at a time when scrutiny of hiring practices in the tech industry is intensifying, with a growing focus on diversity and inclusion.

The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications not only for Palantir but also for other companies in the tech sector facing similar accusations. As the Department of Labor continues to enforce regulations aimed at preventing discrimination in hiring, businesses may need to reevaluate their practices to ensure compliance and foster a more inclusive work environment.

The case highlights the ongoing challenges that many companies face in addressing issues of diversity and representation in their workforce. With increasing awareness and advocacy surrounding these topics, organizations are under pressure to create equitable hiring practices that reflect the diverse society in which they operate.

As the legal proceedings progress, industry observers will be closely watching how Palantir navigates this challenge and what it may mean for the company's reputation and operations moving forward. The implications of the lawsuit extend beyond the immediate context of Palantir, potentially influencing broader discussions about employment practices in the tech industry and the responsibilities of federal contractors.

In conclusion, the lawsuit against Palantir Technologies raises critical questions about employment discrimination and the responsibility of companies to uphold fair hiring practices. With Peter Thiel at the helm, the company is likely to face intense scrutiny as it defends itself against these serious allegations. The outcome of this case could set important precedents for the tech industry and its approach to diversity and inclusion in the workplace.",-18.0,-10.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,670.0,-0.38461538461538464,-0.014925373134328358

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

Authorities are intensifying their investigation into the Chelsea bombing that took place last Saturday, injuring 29 individuals. Fortunately, all those injured have since been discharged from the hospital, allowing them to return to their families and communities as the investigation unfolds.

In a significant development, a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster located four blocks away from the site of the explosion. This discovery has raised concerns and prompted law enforcement to thoroughly examine the area for any additional threats.

Investigators have identified three significant leads that may provide insight into the incident. The first lead involves a hand-written letter that was found alongside the second bomb. This letter contains text partially written in Arabic, which could be crucial in understanding the motivations behind the attack.

The second lead emerged from a chilling 911 call made by an unidentified male caller. This individual warned authorities of potential further explosions, ominously stating, “There will be more.” This threat has escalated the urgency of the investigation as police work to ensure the safety of the public.

The third lead is a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ which claims to serve as the bomber’s manifesto. The post expresses anger towards societal views on the LGBTQ+ community and other social issues, suggesting that the bombings were intended as a form of protest against these perceived injustices. The author of the Tumblr post claims that they will continue their actions to make a difference and eliminate what they see as targets.

While the leads provide valuable information, there is skepticism surrounding the authenticity of the Tumblr claim. Some experts suggest that the individual behind the post may not be the actual bomber but rather someone attempting to take credit for the attack. This uncertainty adds another layer of complexity to the investigation as police work to discern the truth.

As the investigation continues, authorities are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. They are also working closely with community leaders to address concerns and ensure that residents feel safe in the wake of this troubling event.

The Chelsea bombing has sent shockwaves through the community, prompting discussions about safety and security in public spaces. Local officials are emphasizing the importance of cooperation between law enforcement and community members to prevent future incidents.

As investigators sift through the evidence and leads, they are committed to uncovering the truth behind the bombing and bringing those responsible to justice. The community remains on high alert as police work tirelessly to ensure that such an incident does not occur again.

In the meantime, residents are coming together to support one another in the aftermath of the attack. Community gatherings and discussions are being organized to foster a sense of unity and resilience, reminding everyone that they are stronger together in the face of adversity.

The investigation into the Chelsea bombing is ongoing, and police are dedicated to following every lead to ensure the safety of the public. As new information emerges, authorities will continue to update the community and provide guidance on how to stay safe during this challenging time.",-25.0,0.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,580.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As the countdown to the highly anticipated 90-minute debate approaches, questions surrounding Donald Trump's fitness for the challenge have emerged. At 70 years old, Trump has been heavily engaged in campaigning, often without taking much time to rest. His rigorous schedule raises concerns about his mental and physical preparedness for the demanding debate format.

In preparation for a previous debate against Hillary Clinton, Trump demonstrated his commitment to the electoral process by holding a last-minute rally in Roanoke. However, recent signs of stress have surfaced, casting doubt on his ability to perform effectively in the upcoming debate. A notable indicator of this stress was reflected in a tweet he posted shortly before the debate, which included a series of seemingly unrelated topics.

In the tweet, Trump mentioned a shooting in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina. The disjointed nature of these topics suggests that his mind may be wandering, raising concerns about his focus and coherence. Such a display of incoherence could be detrimental to his performance during the debate, where clarity and composure are paramount.

The implications of Trump's current state extend beyond the debate itself, as this situation could jeopardize his campaign. The ability to articulate thoughts clearly and engage effectively with opponents is crucial in the political arena, and any perceived lapses in judgment or clarity could have significant repercussions for his electoral prospects.

As Trump continues to navigate the pressures of the campaign trail, the stakes are higher than ever. The upcoming debate represents not only a platform for policy discussion but also a critical moment for Trump to solidify his standing with voters. However, with stress indicators mounting and questions about his mental fitness arising, the outcome of the debate could be pivotal in determining the trajectory of his campaign.

With the debate looming, all eyes will be on Trump as he steps into the spotlight. Voters will be watching closely to see if he can rise to the occasion or if the mounting pressures of the campaign will hinder his performance. The outcome may very well shape the future of his candidacy and influence the broader political landscape.",-22.0,14.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,408.0,0.8235294117647058,0.03431372549019608

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio – In a striking display of dwindling support, Hillary Clinton's scheduled door-knocking event, set for 1 PM, attracted only one attendee—a supporter of her rival, Donald Trump. The event, which was anticipated to gather numerous volunteers eager to bolster Clinton's campaign efforts, ultimately concluded with only campaign staff present at the site.

As the event unfolded, the sole attendee, identified as a Trump supporter, was asked to leave by Clinton's staff upon realizing his political affiliation. This unusual turn of events highlighted not only the lack of enthusiasm for Clinton's campaign but also the challenges she faces in mobilizing grassroots support.

Despite the Clinton campaign office's preparations for a robust turnout, the reality proved starkly different. The absence of volunteers raised significant questions about the effectiveness of Clinton's campaign strategies and her ground game in a critical election year. Observers noted that if similar events across the nation yield comparable turnout figures, the implications for Clinton's campaign could be dire.

The situation has emerged as a point of alarm for Democrats, particularly as Clinton is perceived to have an electoral advantage going into the election. However, the lack of engagement in Delaware reflects broader concerns about her ability to galvanize supporters and maintain momentum.

In stark contrast, Donald Trump's rallies have been reported to draw thousands of enthusiastic attendees, underscoring a palpable energy among his base. This disparity in turnout raises further questions about Clinton's appeal and the potential ramifications for her campaign as the election approaches.

Political analysts speculate that Trump's current success can be attributed to a variety of factors, including his ability to energize supporters and a favorable polling lead. The enthusiasm surrounding his events stands in sharp contrast to the scene in Delaware, where Clinton's campaign was left with an empty room and unanswered questions about its future viability.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the ramifications of this door-knocking event may extend beyond Ohio. If Clinton's campaign struggles to convert supporters into active participants at local events, it could signal a troubling trend for her candidacy on a national scale. The stark differences in turnout between the two candidates highlight the challenges Clinton faces in rallying support, even as she positions herself as a serious contender in the upcoming election.

With the election timeline tightening, the need for Clinton to reassess her outreach strategies becomes increasingly urgent. The Delaware event serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the importance of grassroots mobilization and the potential consequences of a disengaged voter base.

As both candidates prepare for the final push toward Election Day, the disparity in enthusiasm and attendance at campaign events may play a pivotal role in shaping the outcome. For Clinton, the challenge lies in reigniting the passion of her supporters and transforming the current narrative of dwindling attendance into one of revitalized engagement. Time will tell if her campaign can adapt and respond effectively to the concerns raised by the recent turnout—or if the momentum will continue to tilt in favor of Trump.

In a political environment where every vote counts, the stakes are high, and the coming weeks will be crucial for both candidates as they seek to solidify their positions and rally their bases for the election ahead.",-7.0,30.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,619.0,1.3636363636363635,0.048465266558966075

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a bombing in New York City, immediate reactions from political figures have ignited a debate over terminology and media representation. Former President Donald Trump was quick to label the incident as a ""bombing,"" a term that has since become central to discussions surrounding the event and its coverage.

Despite Trump's use of the term, CNN has faced criticism for their handling of the situation. The network pointedly criticized Trump for his choice of words, even though former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also referred to the attack as a bombing. This inconsistency in media coverage has raised eyebrows, particularly when it was revealed that CNN edited out Clinton's reference to the attack in their reporting.

During an interview on the popular morning show Fox and Friends, Trump did not hold back in his condemnation of CNN, calling the network ""disgusting and disgraceful."" He accused them of dishonesty in their coverage, highlighting what he perceived as a double standard in reporting. ""If I say it, they go crazy,"" Trump remarked, emphasizing that Clinton's similar terminology was overlooked by the media.

Trump further criticized the current leadership, labeling them as ""stupid"" and accusing them of taking a soft approach to terrorism. He argued that a more stringent response is necessary to combat the growing threat posed by extremist groups, suggesting that the United States needs to adopt a tougher stance.

In addition to his critiques of media coverage and leadership, Trump expressed strong opposition to President Obama's plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. He claimed that this initiative poses a significant security risk, arguing that the current vetting processes are inadequate to ensure the safety of American citizens.

Moreover, Trump accused Clinton of wanting to increase the number of refugees beyond what Obama proposed, reinforcing his stance that the vetting process is insufficient. He asserted that allowing more refugees into the country without proper checks could lead to dire consequences.

The fallout from the bombing and the ensuing discussions highlight the complex interplay between political rhetoric, media coverage, and public perception in times of crisis. As debates continue over the best approach to national security and immigration policy, the reactions from Trump and Clinton underscore the stark divisions in American political discourse.

With the incident in New York City still fresh in the minds of many, the conversations surrounding terminology, media integrity, and the implications of refugee policies are likely to persist. As both sides of the political spectrum weigh in, the focus on how these issues are framed will continue to shape public opinion and policy discussions in the months to come. 

As the nation grapples with the implications of such attacks and the responses from its leaders, it remains to be seen how these events will influence the political landscape moving forward. The bombing has not only sparked outrage but has also ignited a debate over the responsibilities of the media in reporting on such sensitive topics, as well as the responsibilities of leaders in addressing national security concerns. 

In an era where every word is scrutinized and every action analyzed, the need for clarity and consistency in communication has never been more critical. As the situation develops, the responses from both Trump and Clinton will likely continue to draw attention, reflecting the ongoing tensions in American politics surrounding security, immigration, and media accountability.",-45.0,-21.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,643.0,-0.9545454545454546,-0.03265940902021773

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

In a surprising turn of events, Ahmad Rahami, a man previously convicted of terrorism, has filed a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The lawsuit, which also includes his father, Mohammad Rahami Sr., and brother, Mohammad, alleges discrimination against their family based on their cultural background.

The Rahami family, originally from Afghanistan and practicing Muslims, owns a chicken restaurant that has been a staple in the community since its establishment in 2002. According to the lawsuit, the family claims that local officials are attempting to shut down their business through a series of unwarranted tickets and court summonses. They assert that their restaurant has been unfairly targeted, particularly for staying open past the 10 PM curfew, despite having the necessary permissions to do so.

The lawsuit paints a picture of alleged harassment and retaliation by the Elizabeth police department, claiming that the police have shown a ""reckless disregard"" for the Rahami family's constitutional rights. The family contends that the police's actions are not only discriminatory but also a form of intimidation aimed at forcing them to close their restaurant earlier than permitted.

In their defense, the police department has cited high crime rates in the area as justification for their increased scrutiny of the Rahami family and their business operations. This rationale, however, has done little to quell the family's claims of unjust treatment. The Rahami family believes that their cultural background has played a significant role in the police's actions against them.

The irony of the situation is heightened by Ahmad Rahami's criminal history. Just five years after the family's allegations of discrimination began, Ahmad was arrested for planting bombs in New York and New Jersey, an act that raised significant questions about his motivations and potential ties to extremism. This background has led some to speculate on the authenticity of the family's claims, as well as the broader implications of their lawsuit.

The case has sparked discussions about the intersection of law enforcement practices and cultural discrimination, particularly within immigrant communities. As the Rahami family seeks justice through the courts, their lawsuit serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in balancing public safety with the rights of individuals.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the Elizabeth police department will likely face scrutiny regarding their practices and the treatment of minority communities in the area. The outcome of this lawsuit may not only impact the Rahami family but could also set a precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future. With the public eye now on this case, the implications of cultural discrimination and law enforcement practices will continue to be a topic of significant interest and debate.",-49.0,-37.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,512.0,-2.0555555555555554,-0.072265625
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

The Clinton Foundation is under fire amid allegations of pay-to-play corruption, suggesting that donors were granted political access in exchange for their contributions to the organization. These claims have raised serious questions about the foundation's operations and its financial practices.

In the wake of these allegations, the Clinton campaign has been quick to emphasize the foundation's charitable work, arguing that it has made significant contributions to various causes. However, critics contend that the foundation primarily functions as a profit-making entity for Hillary Clinton, her family, and their associates, rather than focusing on its stated philanthropic mission.

Financial scrutiny reveals concerning trends within the foundation. In 2014, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants, according to IRS filings. This raises eyebrows, especially when considering the foundation's total expenditures for that year, which amounted to nearly $91.3 million. Of this significant budget, less than $5.2 million was directed toward charitable grants, a figure that many find troubling.

Further analysis of the foundation's spending patterns in 2014 shows that a substantial portion of its budget was devoted to salaries and employee benefits, totaling $34.8 million. Additionally, ""other expenses"" accounted for $50.4 million, suggesting that operational costs overshadowed the foundation's charitable commitments. Notably, charitable spending decreased by 40% in 2014, despite an influx of $30 million in revenue, prompting critics to question the foundation's priorities.

The increase in spending on salaries and other expenses by $5 million in 2014 has also drawn criticism. Observers argue that this trend reflects a troubling shift away from the foundation's original mission of philanthropy, raising concerns about the financial integrity of the organization.

The article suggests that the Clintons may have leveraged Hillary Clinton's position as Secretary of State to solicit funds from wealthy individuals, implying that these donations were exchanged for political favors. This assertion adds another layer to the ongoing debate about the foundation's role and the ethical implications of its operations.

As the controversy continues to unfold, the Clinton Foundation remains at the center of a heated discussion about transparency, accountability, and the intersection of wealth and political influence in the realm of charitable organizations. The implications of these allegations could have lasting effects on the foundation's reputation and its ability to operate effectively in the future.",25.0,12.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,452.0,0.7058823529411765,0.02654867256637168

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York, former President Barack Obama has ignited a wave of criticism from various quarters of the American public. Many were taken aback by his remarks during a high-dollar fundraiser, especially in light of the tragic events that unfolded over the weekend, including bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing incident in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

The author of this article expresses profound disappointment in Obama’s approach, labeling him as ""useless"" and ""arrogant"" for his decision to prioritize fundraising over addressing the recent violence that has left communities shaken. With the nation grappling with the aftermath of these attacks, the expectation was that elected officials, particularly a prominent figure like Obama, would take a moment to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and extend thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families.

However, instead of addressing the bombings, Obama’s speech veered into a critique of sexism he attributes to conservative media figures such as Rush Limbaugh and networks like Fox News. He linked these sentiments to the challenges faced by Hillary Clinton in her campaign, seemingly prioritizing political commentary over the pressing issues of violence and public safety. Critics argue that he may have lacked sufficient information regarding the attacks to comment meaningfully; nonetheless, the author contends that he could have at least expressed condolences for those affected.

The absence of any mention of the victims of the bombings during such a crucial moment has left many feeling disillusioned. The author’s disgust at Obama’s failure to address the attacks is palpable, emphasizing that a leader should be able to balance political discourse with empathy and acknowledgment of national tragedies. The expectation for a response from influential figures during times of crisis is not merely a formality; it is a reflection of the moral responsibility that accompanies leadership.

As the nation processes the implications of the weekend's violence, the focus on political rivalries and campaign strategies appears misplaced. Obama’s decision to engage in a fundraising event, while ignoring the immediate concerns of safety and community healing, raises questions about priorities in leadership. The stark contrast between political campaigning and the need for solidarity in the face of tragedy is a point of contention that resonates deeply with the public.

In a time when unity and compassion are needed most, the author argues that Obama’s speech missed the mark. His focus on critiquing Donald Trump and praising Hillary Clinton, while valid in a political context, should not have overshadowed the pressing need to address the violence that has afflicted American cities. The call for a thoughtful and compassionate response from leaders is more critical than ever, especially when the nation is reeling from acts of violence that threaten public safety.

The criticism surrounding Obama’s remarks reflects a broader sentiment among Americans who expect their leaders to rise above partisan politics, especially during crises. The expectation for empathy and acknowledgment of suffering is a fundamental aspect of effective leadership. As the nation continues to grapple with the implications of the weekend's events, the hope is that future leaders will prioritize the well-being of their constituents over political aspirations.

In conclusion, the fallout from Obama’s speech serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between political engagement and the moral obligations that come with leadership. The author’s disdain for the former president’s perceived neglect of the victims highlights a significant disconnect that many Americans feel in times of crisis, underscoring the need for leaders to remember their responsibility to the people they serve.",-25.0,-41.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,677.0,-1.8636363636363635,-0.060561299852289516
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

Public awareness of potential corruption at the Clinton Foundation is on the rise, particularly regarding its AIDS program during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A new report has surfaced, detailing serious allegations that could have significant implications for the foundation's reputation and operations.

The Daily Caller has reported that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a key component of the Clinton Foundation, distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. This alarming revelation has raised concerns about the efficacy of the treatments provided and may have contributed to increased morbidity and mortality risks among patients, according to a draft congressional report.

CHAI is recognized as one of the foundation's most prominent initiatives, and these allegations could lead to intensified scrutiny of the charity, particularly as Hillary Clinton prepares for her presidential campaign. The report further highlights connections between Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-American figures, which are currently under investigation by the FDA and SEC.

Additionally, there are growing concerns regarding the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, an Indian pharmaceutical company that has faced criticism for its poor quality control and history of fraudulent reporting to the FDA. These ties have prompted calls for the foundation to be shut down to prevent any further harm to vulnerable populations relying on its programs.

As the situation unfolds, uncertainty remains regarding the exact number of AIDS patients affected by the diluted drugs. Advocates and critics alike are urging for transparency and accountability from the Clinton Foundation, as public interest in the integrity of its operations continues to mount.

With the presidential campaign on the horizon, the implications of these allegations could prove significant, potentially reshaping public perception and impacting Hillary Clinton's political aspirations.

Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for enacting poorly worded laws that inadvertently criminalize standard parenting practices. Among the most controversial is a law that categorizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals as a felony. This broad language raises serious concerns, particularly regarding common activities such as diaper changes and baths, which are routine for parents and caregivers.

While the intention behind this legislation is to safeguard children from potential molesters, its vague wording has created a precarious situation for parents. The law, which was designed to protect children, may instead expose innocent caregivers to severe legal repercussions. Critics argue that the lack of clarity in the law could lead to misunderstandings and wrongful accusations against those simply fulfilling their parental duties.

In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court stated that prosecutors are unlikely to pursue charges against parents for innocent conduct. However, this ruling does not alleviate concerns surrounding the legal implications of the law. Defendants are now required to prove a lack of sexual intent, raising significant questions about the presumption of innocence. This shift places a heavy burden on parents, who must navigate the complexities of the legal system to defend themselves against potential allegations.

Legal expert John Pfaff has pointed out additional complications arising from this ruling, particularly concerning plea bargaining. Defendants may feel pressured to accept plea deals due to the looming threat of severe charges, even if they are innocent. This dynamic can lead to unjust outcomes, where individuals plead guilty to avoid the risk of harsher penalties, further complicating the landscape of justice for parents accused of inappropriate conduct.

The implications of these laws extend beyond individual cases; they raise broader concerns about constitutional rights and due process for Arizona residents, especially parents. The potential for misuse of the state’s child molestation laws as a tool for prosecutorial harassment against caregivers is alarming. This situation highlights the precarious balance between protecting children and ensuring that parents can care for their children without the fear of legal repercussions.

With the current legal framework, many are left questioning the reliability of the government to effectively address these issues. The skepticism surrounding the state's ability to navigate the complexities of child protection laws without infringing on parental rights is palpable. As the legislature faces continued criticism, it remains to be seen how lawmakers will respond to the growing concerns about the ramifications of their poorly defined laws.

In summary, the Arizona state legislature's efforts to protect children have inadvertently created a minefield for parents and caregivers. The vague language of the law not only threatens innocent individuals with severe legal consequences but also raises critical questions about the integrity of the justice system. As debates continue, the need for clearer legislation that truly safeguards children while respecting parental rights has never been more urgent.",-12.0,-53.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,532.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.09962406015037593

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts and the 2024 presidential election approaches, speculation is mounting regarding the potential role of former First Lady Michelle Obama in a Hillary Clinton administration. While some view this as an exciting prospect, others express a sense of fatigue over the continued focus on the Obama legacy, particularly following Barack Obama’s presidency.

Critics of Michelle Obama’s legacy have raised eyebrows over her initiatives during her time in the White House. One of the most notable programs, her school lunch initiative, aimed at combating childhood obesity, has faced scrutiny. Detractors argue that while the intent was noble, the execution led to unintended consequences, including complaints from students about the quality and palatability of the meals provided. Additionally, some of her statements have sparked controversy, leading to questions about her overall impact and effectiveness in her role as First Lady.

As discussions about her potential involvement in a Clinton administration heat up, questions regarding Michelle Obama’s qualifications for any new role are also surfacing. Critics are keen to assess whether her experience as First Lady translates into the necessary skills for a significant position in government. The debate centers on whether her advocacy work and public presence can adequately prepare her for the complexities of a political environment, especially one as contentious as the current landscape.

Amid these discussions, concerns have been raised about Hillary Clinton’s views on government involvement in child-rearing. Many critics argue that Clinton’s approach may align with progressive ideologies that advocate for increased government control over education and parenting. This perspective has alarmed some voters, who fear that such policies may undermine parental authority and individual choice in raising children. Michelle Obama’s commitment to promoting healthy living for children has been viewed by some as an extension of this progressive agenda, further fueling skepticism.

Despite the criticisms, Michelle Obama remains steadfast in her mission to advocate for children’s health and well-being. Her ongoing campaign for healthy living continues to resonate with many, particularly among those who appreciate her dedication to improving the lives of young people. However, the challenge lies in bridging the gap between her supporters and those who may be wary of Clinton’s governance style.

The author of this article expresses a strong disapproval of the perceived progressive control over education and parenting, indicating a broader unease with government involvement in personal matters. This sentiment reflects a growing divide among voters, particularly those who favor the Obamas but harbor reservations about Clinton’s policies and approach. The potential for Michelle Obama to play a role in a Clinton administration could serve as a strategic move to appeal to this demographic, yet it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to sway those who are skeptical of Clinton’s vision.

As speculation continues to swirl, it is clear that the intersection of the Obama legacy and a Clinton administration raises complex questions about leadership, qualifications, and the role of government in the lives of families. While Michelle Obama’s commitment to children’s health is commendable, the dialogue surrounding her potential involvement in a future administration highlights the intricate dynamics at play in American politics today. The outcome of these discussions could significantly impact the direction of the Democratic Party as it seeks to unite diverse factions ahead of the upcoming election.",6.0,22.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,635.0,1.0,0.03464566929133858

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep.

Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has emerged involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), with serious allegations that the organization distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This troubling revelation raises significant concerns about the efficacy and safety of treatments provided to some of the world's most vulnerable populations battling the disease.

The controversy is linked to Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, a company that has faced severe scrutiny in the past. In 2013, Ranbaxy was found guilty of defrauding the U.S. government and introducing adulterated drugs into the market. This history of malpractice has prompted renewed questions about the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and Ranbaxy, particularly in light of the recent allegations regarding the quality of HIV/AIDS drugs distributed by CHAI.

A congressional report initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn has brought these issues to the forefront, questioning the Clintons' awareness of Ranbaxy's actions and the potential consequences of their partnership. The report highlights the grave risks associated with the distribution of diluted drugs, including increased morbidity and mortality among patients who rely on these treatments for their survival. Blackburn has expressed deep concern over the impact of this scandal, asking a poignant question: How many lives were lost due to the false promises of effective treatment?

The implications of the congressional report are profound, as it underscores not only the potential harm inflicted upon patients but also the ethical responsibilities of organizations like CHAI in ensuring the quality of medical treatments distributed in resource-limited settings. The report's findings suggest a troubling lack of oversight and accountability in the distribution of essential medications, raising alarms about the potential for widespread harm in communities already grappling with the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS.

The Clinton Foundation's ongoing relationship with Ranbaxy is under intense scrutiny, particularly given the firm's documented history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Critics argue that the Clintons have prioritized financial gain over the well-being of vulnerable populations, particularly in Africa, where access to effective HIV/AIDS treatment is crucial for millions of individuals.

In a related development, ProPublica reported that in 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy. This financial support has raised serious concerns about the quality of medicines provided through this partnership and whether due diligence was exercised in ensuring that patients received safe and effective treatments. The allocation of such substantial funding to a company with a checkered past has led to calls for greater transparency and accountability in the distribution of aid and medications to those in need.

Despite the gravity of the allegations and the potential risks posed to patients, the Clinton Foundation has not severed ties with Ranbaxy. The company's continued distribution of HIV/AIDS drugs globally raises questions about the organization's commitment to patient safety and ethical practices in healthcare. Critics assert that the Clintons' willingness to maintain this relationship, despite the alarming revelations, suggests a troubling disregard for the health and lives of those they claim to support.

The fallout from this scandal could have far-reaching implications for the Clinton Foundation and CHAI, as public trust in their ability to deliver safe and effective healthcare solutions is called into question. The allegations of distributing ""watered-down"" drugs not only undermine the credibility of the organizations involved but also threaten to erode the hard-won progress made in the fight against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.

As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how the Clintons will respond to these allegations and what steps they will take to address the concerns raised by Blackburn and others. The health and lives of countless individuals hang in the balance, and the need for accountability and transparency in the distribution of healthcare resources has never been more critical.

In conclusion, the emerging scandal surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its ties to Ranbaxy raises serious ethical questions about the distribution of healthcare in vulnerable populations. As the investigation progresses, the focus will likely remain on the implications for patient safety and the responsibilities of organizations that seek to provide essential medical treatments. The stakes are high, and the call for accountability is louder than ever as the world watches to see how this situation develops.",-63.0,-24.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,791.0,-0.96,-0.03034134007585335

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated that the State Department release documents concerning the completion of security training by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her aides within a tight five-day timeframe. This decision comes amidst ongoing scrutiny and legal challenges surrounding the handling of classified materials by high-ranking officials.

The order was issued by Judge Richard Leon, who has been overseeing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by the Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF). The organization has been actively pursuing these documents to clarify whether Clinton, along with her close aides Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, and Jacob Sullivan, completed the mandatory annual security briefings required for individuals handling classified information.

Judge Leon's ruling is particularly notable as he rejected the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, signaling the court's support for TheDCNF's efforts to obtain transparency regarding the security training of these prominent figures. However, the judge did deny TheDCNF's request to depose State Department officials, limiting the avenues through which the organization can gather information.

The State Department has faced criticism for its lack of transparency in this matter, as it has not provided any records confirming that Clinton and her aides received the necessary security briefings. This raises significant questions about compliance with established protocols for handling sensitive information, which is especially pertinent given Clinton's high-profile role during her tenure as Secretary of State.

In a July 29 response from the State Department, it was indicated that the requested security training courses had not been completed by Clinton or her aides. This revelation has fueled ongoing debates about the implications of such lapses in security training for individuals entrusted with national security responsibilities.

Judge Leon has expressed palpable frustration with the delays exhibited by the State Department throughout this process. To expedite the release of the requested documents, he has established clear deadlines: one third of the documents must be made available by September 26, with the remainder due by October 10. This timeline underscores the urgency of the situation and reflects the court's commitment to ensuring compliance with FOIA requirements.

Attorney Bradley Moss, who has been involved in the case, echoed the judge's sentiments, highlighting the ongoing challenges posed by the State Department's perceived obstruction of the FOIA process. The insistence on transparency in government operations, especially concerning the handling of classified materials, is a critical issue that resonates with the public and raises concerns about accountability among public officials.

The ruling and the surrounding circumstances have garnered attention not only for their legal implications but also for their potential political ramifications. The scrutiny of Clinton and her aides' actions during their time in office remains a contentious topic, and the release of these documents may shed light on previously unanswered questions regarding their compliance with security protocols.

As the deadlines set by Judge Leon approach, the focus will remain on the State Department's actions and whether it will adhere to the court's order. The outcome of this case may have broader implications for the administration of transparency laws and the accountability of government officials in handling sensitive information.

In summary, the recent ruling by Judge Richard Leon marks a pivotal moment in the pursuit of transparency regarding the security training of Hillary Clinton and her aides. With the State Department under pressure to release the requested documents, the case highlights the ongoing challenges of ensuring accountability in government dealings, particularly in relation to the handling of classified materials. As the deadlines draw near, the public and legal observers alike will be closely monitoring the situation, awaiting the State Department's compliance with the court's order.",-5.0,2.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,688.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0029069767441860465
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the nation gears up for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the choice of moderator has sparked significant discussion. Lester Holt will take the reins during this highly anticipated event, yet he has confirmed that he will not engage in fact-checking the candidates’ statements. This decision has raised eyebrows and ignited concerns about the integrity of the debate, particularly in light of Trump's history of making frequent falsehoods.

The absence of on-screen fact-checking is not limited to Holt’s moderation; major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, have also opted against providing real-time verification of candidates' claims during the debate. This lack of accountability allows Trump to potentially make unchallenged statements, placing the burden of truth on Clinton. As a result, the dynamic of the debate appears skewed, with Clinton facing the daunting task of not only presenting her policies but also countering any misinformation that may arise without immediate rebuttal.

Clinton’s campaign has voiced strong concerns about this approach, emphasizing the crucial role of the moderator in challenging falsehoods to ensure a fair exchange. The expectation is that Clinton will have to exceed the already high expectations placed upon her to seem credible in the face of Trump’s unverified assertions. This situation creates an unfair narrative, where the stakes are disproportionately high for one candidate, while the other is afforded a platform to speak without immediate scrutiny.

Critics of the media have pointed to a troubling trend: the reluctance to fact-check candidates stems from fears over ratings and viewership. This prioritization of entertainment value over journalistic integrity raises questions about the role of media outlets during such a critical electoral process. The debate is not just about the candidates; it is also a reflection of the current state of journalism, which some argue is failing to uphold its responsibility to inform the public accurately.

As the debate approaches, the implications of this lack of fact-checking are profound. With the potential for the spread of misinformation, the integrity of the democratic process is at stake. Observers are left wondering how this will affect voter perception and the overall outcome of the election. The media's decision to forgo fact-checking may ultimately lead to a debate that lacks the accountability necessary for a fair political discourse.

In conclusion, the first presidential debate presents not only an opportunity for candidates to present their visions for America but also a significant test for the media's role in ensuring a truthful dialogue. As the nation watches, the implications of this decision will likely resonate far beyond the debate stage, shaping the future of political communication and journalism itself.",-6.0,3.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,499.0,0.16666666666666666,0.006012024048096192
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

Dolly Kyle, a longtime associate of former President Bill Clinton, has publicly expressed her concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In a recent interview, Kyle articulated her belief that Clinton is driven by deep-seated anger and rage, which she fears could lead to a significant physical breakdown.

Kyle's assertions extend beyond mere emotional observations. She claims that Clinton is displaying signs of cognitive impairment, raising questions about her mental acuity and overall fitness for office. According to Kyle, these issues manifest in various ways, including emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty completing tasks that would typically be expected of a presidential candidate.

Adding to her critique, Kyle pointed out what she perceives as Clinton's paranoia and controlling nature. She argues that these traits are detrimental for someone seeking the highest office in the land, suggesting that they could hinder her ability to lead effectively. 

In an effort to shed light on these troubling aspects of Clinton's character and health, Kyle authored a book titled “Hillary the Other Woman.” The book aims to provide readers with a deeper understanding of Clinton's psychological state and its implications for her political ambitions. Kyle's portrayal of Clinton is stark; she describes her as being addicted to power, suggesting that Clinton's relentless pursuit of political influence may come at the expense of her health and, by extension, the well-being of the Democratic Party.

These comments from Kyle come at a time when Hillary Clinton is already facing significant challenges in maintaining a positive public image. Ongoing health and character scandals have plagued her, and Kyle's remarks only add fuel to the fire of criticism surrounding Clinton's candidacy. 

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Kyle's revelations may resonate with voters who are concerned about the mental and physical fitness of their leaders. The implications of her statements could reverberate throughout the Democratic Party as it prepares for future elections. 

In a climate where public perception can significantly impact a candidate's viability, the concerns raised by Kyle could potentially influence opinions about Clinton's readiness to serve as president. As the political discourse unfolds, it remains to be seen how these critiques will shape the narrative surrounding Hillary Clinton's candidacy in the coming months.",-13.0,-15.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,432.0,-1.0,-0.034722222222222224

IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In a landscape often characterized as a ""nation of immigrants"" and a ""melting pot,"" the discourse surrounding immigration in the United States and Canada has taken a definitive turn towards unity and cultural integration. As communities grapple with the challenges of diversity, a growing sentiment emphasizes the importance of immigrants adapting to their new home’s customs and traditions, rather than maintaining separate programs that could hinder social cohesion.

A recent statement by a Quebec mayor has brought this issue to the forefront of public discussion. The mayor, addressing the complexities of immigration, specifically pointed out the necessity for immigrants, particularly Muslims, to integrate into Canadian culture and embrace the Canadian way of life. His remarks underscore a belief that while Canada welcomes individuals from various backgrounds, it is imperative that the Canadian identity and culture remain intact and not be compromised by external influences.

The mayor's assertion that Canadians are neither racist nor xenophobic reflects a broader perspective within the country. He noted that Canada has historically accepted immigrants from diverse backgrounds, which has contributed to the nation’s rich cultural tapestry. However, he firmly believes that with the privilege of living in Canada comes the responsibility to assimilate into its societal norms.

One of the more contentious points raised by the mayor was the stance on religious practices. He argued that religion should be kept private and that there is no obligation for the Canadian society to accommodate Islamic practices or Sharia law within its legal framework. This position resonates with a growing concern among many Canadians who feel that the principles of Canadian law and customs should take precedence over the imposition of foreign legal systems.

In a provocative suggestion, the mayor advised that those who find themselves uncomfortable with Canadian culture might consider returning to one of the 57 Muslim-majority countries. This remark has sparked a debate about the expectations placed upon immigrants and the extent to which they should adapt to their new environment. The article expresses frustration with the notion of outsiders attempting to dictate the lives of citizens in their own country, highlighting a sentiment that resonates with many who value the traditions and principles of their homeland.

In the United States, similar sentiments are echoed in legislative actions being taken in states like Texas. Lawmakers are working to prevent the implementation of Sharia law within the state's judicial system, reflecting a commitment to uphold American values and legal standards. This legislative movement aligns with the broader conversation about the role of immigrants in society and the expectation that they should either adopt the local culture or choose to leave if they are unable to do so.

The overarching message emerging from these discussions is clear: immigrants are encouraged to embrace the culture of their new home. The call for unity and integration underscores the belief that a cohesive society is built on shared values and mutual respect.

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a tense moment that unfolded in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through a demonstration. Witnesses at the scene initially feared for his safety, speculating that he might be in danger of being mugged as protesters surrounded his vehicle.

However, in a surprising turn of events, the protesters allowed the man to pass without incident, contrasting sharply with other recent incidents across the nation where vehicles have been stopped and looted during protests. This unexpected leniency from the demonstrators seemed to set the stage for a peaceful resolution.

As the man attempted to navigate through the crowd, he displayed a handgun out of his window. This action prompted the protesters to disperse quickly, allowing him to continue on his way without further confrontation. Observers noted that his calm demeanor and the visible firearm effectively diffused what could have escalated into a more dangerous situation.

The incident raises a pivotal question: Did the man handle the situation correctly by displaying his firearm, or would it have been more prudent for him to simply drive through the crowd? While some may argue that his display of the weapon was a necessary measure for self-defense, others might contend that such an action could have provoked further tensions or violence.

Ultimately, the encounter highlights the complexities of navigating protests in today’s sociopolitical climate. It underscores the thin line between self-defense and escalation, and the varying perceptions of safety among individuals in such charged environments. As discussions about the appropriate responses to protests continue, this incident serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of public demonstrations and the potential consequences of actions taken in the heat of the moment. 

As communities grapple with these challenging dynamics, the question lingers: what is the right course of action when faced with a crowd that may perceive you as a threat, and how can individuals ensure their safety without exacerbating an already volatile situation? The answers may vary, but the conversation is essential.",-18.0,-21.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,386.0,-1.5,-0.054404145077720206
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

In a pointed critique, local observers have called out Chicago environmentalists for what they perceive as hypocrisy regarding their support for certain development projects. The article argues that leftist activists champion environmental issues until those issues begin to personally affect them.

A notable example of this alleged double standard arose when environmentalists previously opposed filmmaker George Lucas's proposal to build a museum in the city, citing environmental concerns. However, these same activists have expressed support for the construction of the Obama Presidential Center, a project that has raised eyebrows due to its environmental implications.

Juanita Irizarry, the executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly expressed excitement over the Obama center's construction. This enthusiasm stands in stark contrast to the environmental impact of both projects. While Lucas's museum was planned for an existing parking lot, the Obama center requires the bulldozing of trees at Jackson Park, raising serious concerns about ecological disruption.

The article further challenges the concept of ""white privilege"" in the context of these decisions, questioning the motivations behind the differing responses to the two projects. Critics argue that the support for the Obama center highlights a troubling inconsistency in the environmentalists' stance, as they seem willing to overlook significant environmental degradation when it aligns with their political preferences.

As the debate continues, the article underscores the contradictions within the environmental movement in Chicago, prompting a broader discussion about the true priorities of those who advocate for ecological preservation.",3.0,8.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,283.0,0.8,0.028268551236749116

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

General Stanley McChrystal, the former Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, found himself at the center of a significant political clash with President Barack Obama. Known for his strategic leadership, McChrystal's tenure was marked by frequent disagreements with the President regarding the conduct of the war, a situation that ultimately led to a pivotal moment in their relationship.

Anticipating the end of his Army career, McChrystal was summoned to the Oval Office for a crucial meeting. During this encounter, President Obama accused the General of lacking support for him as a politician, a claim that struck at the heart of military-civilian relations. In a decisive response, McChrystal reaffirmed his commitment to his role as Commander-in-Chief, emphasizing that his duty was to support Obama in that capacity. Following this exchange, McChrystal handed in his resignation.

The tension between the two leaders was further underscored by Obama's history of negative views towards the US military and its personnel. As McChrystal resigned, the President made a dismissive remark, suggesting he would be pleased to desecrate Obama's grave. The General, maintaining his composure, saluted and retorted that he would not stand in line to pee on the President's grave.

This dramatic confrontation reflects the complexities of military leadership and political oversight, highlighting the challenges faced by those in uniform when navigating the intricacies of civilian authority.

Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

In recent events, the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, has become a focal point for unrest, with a significant portion of the rioters identified as being from outside the state. Reports indicate that at least 70% of those involved in the disturbances were not local residents, raising alarms about the nature and organization behind the protests.

Authorities noted that many rioters possessed out-of-state identification, suggesting a level of pre-planning and coordination that is atypical for local demonstrations. The head of the Charlotte police union described these individuals as ""professional criminals,"" implying that their actions were not merely spontaneous expressions of dissent but rather part of a more calculated effort to incite chaos.

In contrast to the turmoil in Charlotte, the situation in Tulsa has unfolded quite differently. While there were reports of individuals being bused in by the Black Lives Matter movement, the overall atmosphere remained peaceful. This divergence highlights the role of local sentiment and community engagement in shaping the outcomes of protests. Residents of Tulsa have demonstrated a commitment to addressing their issues without resorting to violence, a stark contrast to the actions seen in Charlotte.

CNN has echoed these sentiments, stating that the disturbances in Charlotte were largely instigated by ""outside entities"" rather than local protestors. This assertion points to a troubling trend where local movements are potentially being manipulated by external forces with agendas that may not align with the interests of the community. The suggestion is that these outside radicals are leveraging local grievances to further their own aims, which could include inciting violence and chaos.

The article raises questions about the motivations behind such orchestrated efforts. The narrative implies a broader agenda that aligns with ideologies often associated with communism, suggesting that the disturbances are part of a larger revolutionary movement seeking to destabilize societal norms. This perspective highlights a growing concern that protests, which typically arise from genuine local issues, may be co-opted by those seeking to exploit the situation for their own ends.

Local communities, often comprised of residents who are deeply invested in their neighborhoods, typically express their concerns through peaceful means. The prevailing belief is that genuine protests stem from a desire to address specific issues that affect the community directly. However, the influx of outside individuals, as seen in Charlotte, complicates this narrative and raises the specter of organized disruption.

The contrasting responses in Charlotte and Tulsa serve as a case study in the impact of local versus external influences on protest dynamics. In Charlotte, the presence of professional criminals and the apparent lack of local engagement have contributed to an atmosphere of unrest, while Tulsa's peaceful demonstrations suggest that community involvement can lead to more constructive outcomes.

As cities across the nation grapple with issues of social justice and community concerns, the need for vigilance against external manipulation becomes increasingly important. The events in Charlotte serve as a reminder of the complexities involved in modern protests and the potential for outside forces to shape the narrative and outcomes in ways that may not reflect the true sentiments of local residents.

In conclusion, the situation in Charlotte raises critical questions about the nature of protests and the influence of outside entities. As communities seek to address their concerns, it is essential to remain aware of the potential for manipulation and to foster an environment where local voices can be heard and respected. The contrasting experiences of Charlotte and Tulsa highlight the importance of community engagement in navigating the challenges of modern activism.",-17.0,-19.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,653.0,-0.7916666666666666,-0.02909647779479326
Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a pivotal issue in the current Presidential campaign, with concerns evolving from mere conspiracy theories to serious allegations regarding potential neurological diseases. Following her collapse on September 11th, even her supportive media outlets can no longer overlook the implications of her health struggles.

Adding to the intrigue, expert Clif Hite has introduced a controversial theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and been replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this theory would rank among the largest cover-ups in American political history. Reports indicate that Russian intelligence is exploiting video evidence to assert that Clinton has been using doubles and has remained confined to her daughter's apartment.

Furthermore, there are alarming claims surrounding a secret plane crash involving Clinton, purportedly resulting in serious injuries. While some sources were initially skeptical of this narrative, a growing number are beginning to consider the information credible.

As the campaign progresses, the discourse surrounding Clinton's health continues to intensify, raising questions about transparency and the implications for her candidacy.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC.

In a significant development in the political landscape, Discover the Networks has identified 187 groups funded by George Soros that are actively opposing the values espoused by former President Donald Trump. Among these organizations is a newly formed political action committee (PAC) named Common Defense PAC, which has set its sights on challenging Trump’s influence and policies.

Common Defense PAC positions itself as an advocate for the rights of all Americans, explicitly stating its opposition to Trump and his administration. The PAC's mission is framed around the idea of protecting civil liberties and promoting a more inclusive political dialogue. However, its leadership page prominently features military veterans, although it notably lacks contact information for these individuals, raising questions about transparency and accountability.

The PAC has been vocal in its anti-Trump messaging, sharing content that is critical of the former president and collaborating with other PACs that are similarly funded by Soros. This coordination has led to the promotion of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is further amplified by the progressive organization MoveOn.org, signaling a broader coalition of groups united against Trump’s political agenda.

In an ambitious outreach effort, Common Defense PAC has engaged in a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump, which has reportedly reached over 4.5 million people. This campaign aims to galvanize public support and mobilize opposition against Trump, utilizing social media to expand its reach and impact.

In addition to its online campaigns, Common Defense PAC has taken to the streets, organizing protests that call on prominent Republican figures to reconsider their endorsements of Trump. Notably, the PAC, in collaboration with MoveOn.org, staged a protest urging Senator John McCain to withdraw his endorsement of the former president, highlighting the ongoing tensions within the Republican Party regarding Trump’s leadership.

Financially, Common Defense PAC appears to be operating with limited resources, as evidenced by its July filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which lists only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This raises questions about the financial sustainability of the PAC and its ability to compete with more established political organizations.

At the helm of Common Defense PAC is Director Perry O’Brien, a known left-wing activist and conscientious objector. O’Brien’s background has led to scrutiny regarding the PAC’s representation of veterans, as the organization primarily consists of his leadership and vision. Critics have suggested that the PAC may not fully encapsulate the diverse perspectives of veterans, raising concerns about its legitimacy as a representative voice for those who have served in the military.

The emergence of Common Defense PAC and its alignment with other Soros-backed organizations has led to speculation that these groups are strategically created to undermine Trump’s campaign. With significant funding from Soros, they appear to be part of a larger effort to challenge Trump’s influence and promote an alternative political narrative that resonates with a segment of the American electorate.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the activities of Common Defense PAC and its allies will likely play a crucial role in shaping the discourse around Trump and his policies. With the backing of influential figures and organizations, the PAC is poised to make an impact in the upcoming electoral cycles, particularly as it seeks to mobilize support among veterans and their families.

In conclusion, the formation of Common Defense PAC underscores the ongoing polarization in American politics, with groups emerging on both sides of the aisle to advocate for their respective values. As the 2024 elections approach, the activities of this PAC, alongside its Soros funding, will be closely monitored by both supporters and opponents of Trump, as it seeks to carve out its place in the political arena.",8.0,20.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,706.0,0.9090909090909091,0.028328611898016998

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has uncovered that the Obama administration allocated over $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques around the world. This substantial expenditure has sparked significant controversy, raising concerns among taxpayer advocates about the implications of such funding, particularly in relation to its potential support for groups that may have ties to terrorism.

Critics of the initiative argue that spending such a large sum on overseas religious institutions is particularly troubling given the current economic struggles faced by many Americans. With a significant portion of the U.S. population grappling with unemployment and the nation confronting ongoing budgetary challenges, the decision to direct resources toward foreign mosque renovations has been met with outrage. Many citizens feel that these funds would be better utilized addressing pressing domestic issues, rather than being funneled into foreign projects.

The State Department has responded to the backlash by characterizing the funding as a ""good-will effort."" According to officials, the initiative aims to foster relationships with Islamic leaders and combat extremism by promoting a more moderate interpretation of Islam. However, this rationale has not alleviated the concerns of critics, who question the wisdom of such expenditures during a time when many Americans are struggling to make ends meet.

The perception that U.S. resources are being redirected to Islamic countries while urgent domestic issues remain unaddressed has only intensified the criticism. Many taxpayers feel that their hard-earned money should be prioritized for local needs, such as education, infrastructure, and job creation, rather than supporting overseas religious renovations. This sentiment is further fueled by the belief that the funding could inadvertently contribute to the support of Islamic terrorism, as some critics argue that money spent on mosques could ultimately bolster organizations with extremist affiliations.

Additionally, there are claims that the funding for mosque renovations coincides with the resettlement of Muslim refugees in the U.S., which some argue alters the demographic landscape of the country. Critics contend that these developments could lead to increased tensions and further exacerbate divisions within American society. The combination of mosque renovations abroad and refugee resettlement at home has raised alarms about the potential long-term implications for national security and social cohesion.

As the investigation continues to unfold, the debate surrounding the appropriateness of using taxpayer funds for overseas mosque renovations is likely to intensify. Advocates for fiscal responsibility are urging lawmakers to reconsider the allocation of such significant resources, especially in light of the economic challenges facing many families across the nation. The call for greater transparency and accountability in government spending is becoming increasingly prominent, as citizens demand to know how their money is being utilized and whether it aligns with their priorities.

In conclusion, the CBS investigation has shed light on a contentious issue that resonates deeply with many Americans. The decision to spend over $770 million in taxpayer funds on renovating mosques overseas has raised critical questions about the government's priorities and its commitment to addressing domestic concerns. As the nation grapples with economic hardships, the juxtaposition of foreign aid for religious institutions against the backdrop of local struggles has ignited a passionate debate about the direction of U.S. foreign policy and the allocation of taxpayer dollars. The outcome of this discussion may have lasting implications for both domestic and international relations, as citizens continue to advocate for a more balanced approach to government spending.",-13.0,-10.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,624.0,-0.47619047619047616,-0.016025641025641024

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

In a bold response to the growing threat of terrorism, a series of billboards featuring U.S. Marines have been unveiled across the nation. This initiative aims to demonstrate the Marines' unwavering readiness to confront terrorist groups, such as ISIS, that use fear and propaganda as tools to intimidate and force conversions.

Terrorist organizations have long relied on tactics that include labeling individuals who refuse to convert as infidels, often leading to severe repercussions, including death threats and the creation of hit lists. These actions are designed to instill fear and compliance among the populace. However, the Marines are unbothered by these threats, embracing the challenge posed by such extremist groups. 

The timing of this billboard campaign is particularly significant, coinciding with an alarming increase in terrorist attacks within the United States. By promoting a message of strength and preparedness, the Marines aim to counteract the terrorists' agenda of fear. The billboards serve as a public declaration that the Marines are not only ready to confront these threats but are also committed to protecting the values and freedoms that define the nation.

This initiative is more than just a display of military readiness; it is a strategic move to undermine the psychological power that terrorists wield. By showcasing fearlessness, the Marines seek to inspire confidence among citizens, reminding them that they are not alone in the fight against terrorism. The message is clear: the Marines stand ready to defend against those who seek to sow discord and fear.

The billboards are strategically placed in high-visibility areas, ensuring that the message reaches a wide audience. Each billboard features striking imagery of Marines in action, accompanied by powerful slogans that reinforce their commitment to national security. This visual representation serves to remind the public that there are dedicated individuals ready to confront threats head-on, fostering a sense of solidarity and resilience within the community.

As the campaign unfolds, it is expected to resonate with many Americans who may feel vulnerable in light of recent events. The Marines' proactive stance not only serves to bolster public morale but also sends a clear message to terrorists: their attempts to instill fear will not succeed. 

In conclusion, the Marines' billboard campaign stands as a testament to their resolve and readiness to tackle the challenges posed by terrorism. By promoting a narrative of fearlessness and strength, they aim to inspire confidence in the face of adversity, ultimately undermining the power that extremist groups seek to wield over the populace.",-53.0,-13.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,468.0,-0.7222222222222222,-0.027777777777777776

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is reeling from a wave of violence that has gripped the city, leading to widespread rioting characterized by looting, vandalism, arson, and even murder. In response to the escalating chaos, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency, mobilizing the National Guard to help restore order and ensure the safety of residents.

The unrest has raised serious concerns among city officials and community leaders, prompting swift action to address the situation. As part of the response, officials announced that individuals found participating in the riots or engaging in violent acts will face severe consequences, including the permanent revocation of government benefits. This measure aims to deter those considering joining the unrest and to underscore the seriousness of the situation.

In a move that underscores the gravity of the circumstances, officials have also indicated that minor children who take part in violent activities will face repercussions that extend beyond their own actions. This could lead to significant consequences for their parents, including the potential loss of government benefits and custody issues. City official Wilson Stewart emphasized the critical role of parental responsibility in this context, urging parents to closely monitor their children's activities and ensure they adhere to a newly implemented curfew.

The curfew, a key component of the city’s strategy to restore peace, has been instituted to help mitigate further violence and provide a structured environment for residents during this tumultuous time. Officials believe that by limiting movement during certain hours, they can reduce the likelihood of additional riots and promote a sense of safety within the community.

Stewart's remarks highlight the importance of community involvement in curbing the violence. He called on parents to take an active role in their children's lives, particularly during this period of unrest. ""It is imperative that parents know where their children are and what they are doing,"" Stewart stated. ""We must work together to ensure that our youth understand the consequences of their actions, and that they are held accountable.""

The city's leadership is hopeful that these measures will not only deter further violent protests but also foster a culture of responsibility among families. By addressing the issue at both the individual and communal levels, officials aim to restore a sense of normalcy and safety to Charlotte.

As the National Guard works alongside local law enforcement to regain control, the community holds its breath, hoping for a swift resolution to the violence that has marred the city. With the implementation of the curfew and the strict penalties for those involved in the riots, officials are determined to send a clear message: violence will not be tolerated, and those who engage in it will face serious consequences.

In these challenging times, Charlotte's residents are urged to remain vigilant and engaged, as the city navigates through this crisis with the hope of emerging stronger and more united.",-33.0,0.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,549.0,0.0,0.0

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey is under intense scrutiny and may be facing resignation amid growing criticism regarding his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. This situation has escalated as key figures in the investigation have been granted immunity, raising questions about the integrity of the process.

Comey’s decision to grant immunity to top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, has sparked significant backlash. Critics argue that Mills allegedly did not fully cooperate with the investigation, further complicating the narrative surrounding Comey’s actions. The implications of these decisions have led to a broader examination of Comey’s role and the legitimacy of the FBI’s investigation.

As the controversy unfolds, a House Judiciary Committee hearing is scheduled for September 28, where Comey’s fate will be deliberated. This hearing is expected to delve into the details of the investigation and Comey’s decisions, providing a platform for lawmakers to express their concerns.

One prominent critic, former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova, has vocally called for Comey’s resignation. DiGenova has characterized the investigation as insufficient, suggesting that it was not conducted with the intent to pursue justice. He claims that the FBI’s actions may have been designed to protect individuals rather than hold them accountable, raising serious questions about the investigation's integrity.

The situation is further complicated by Congress’s issuance of a subpoena to Comey for documents related to the Clinton email scandal. This subpoena comes after Comey previously failed to provide the requested documents, leading to increased frustration among lawmakers. The lack of transparency in the investigation has contributed to the growing calls for accountability.

As Comey navigates this turbulent landscape, questions about his loyalty to Clinton have emerged. Critics are scrutinizing the implications of his actions, pondering how they affect both his career and his legal standing. The investigation has not only become a focal point in political discourse but has also raised concerns about the FBI's credibility and the pursuit of justice.

With the upcoming hearing and the ongoing investigation, the pressure is mounting on Comey to clarify his decisions and address the allegations against him. The outcome of these developments may have lasting repercussions for Comey and the FBI, as well as for the broader political landscape as the nation continues to grapple with the implications of the Clinton email scandal.

As the situation evolves, all eyes will be on the House Judiciary Committee hearing, where Comey will have the opportunity to defend his actions and outline the rationale behind the FBI's investigation.

As debates surrounding U.S. foreign policy and its alliances intensify, concerns have been raised regarding the ongoing support for Saudi Arabia, particularly in light of the kingdom's controversial history and its implications for international relations. Critics point to the troubling origins of the 9/11 terrorists, many of whom were Saudi nationals, as a significant factor in questioning the ethicality of continued U.S. backing for the kingdom.

Adding to the ethical quandary, reports suggest that Saudi Arabia funded approximately 20% of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. This revelation has sparked widespread criticism and raised questions about the implications of accepting financial support from a nation with a contentious human rights record. Critics argue that such funding could compromise political integrity and influence policy decisions, particularly regarding women's rights and humanitarian issues.

The situation has been further complicated by alarming allegations that Saudi Arabia is involved in the trafficking of sex slaves, particularly those captured by ISIS. Reports indicate that the kingdom is allegedly auctioning off these victims to the highest bidder, with a disturbing array of buyers that includes Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis, and Westerners. Eyewitness accounts have emerged detailing the horrific conditions under which these women are held, with various nationalities represented among the victims. The trafficking of sex slaves, especially targeting vulnerable groups such as Yazidi girls and non-Muslim women, has drawn widespread condemnation and highlighted the urgent need for accountability.

Human rights advocates have called for immediate action, urging Britain to cease its arms sales to Saudi Arabia and pressing U.S. politicians to reevaluate their relationships with the kingdom. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the role of various nations in perpetuating violence have led to calls for greater transparency and responsibility in foreign policy decisions. Activists emphasize that the sale of weapons to a nation implicated in such egregious human rights violations raises serious moral questions.

Criticism of Hillary Clinton's associations with Saudi Arabia has intensified in light of these allegations. As a prominent political figure who has received funding from the kingdom, Clinton faces scrutiny regarding her stance on women's rights and her potential complicity in supporting a regime known for its oppressive policies. The juxtaposition of her political ambitions and the realities faced by women in Saudi Arabia has sparked a broader conversation about the responsibilities of leaders in championing human rights.

Moreover, accusations have surfaced alleging that both Saudi Arabia and Russia are providing support to ISIS. This troubling claim has prompted calls for political accountability and a reevaluation of alliances that may inadvertently bolster extremist groups. The implications of such support extend beyond national borders, impacting global security and stability.

As the discourse surrounding U.S. support for Saudi Arabia continues to evolve, the ethical ramifications of political donations, the trafficking of women, and the broader geopolitical landscape remain at the forefront of public concern. The need for a comprehensive reassessment of foreign policy strategies has never been more pressing, as advocates urge leaders to prioritize human rights and humanitarian considerations over political expediency.

In conclusion, the intertwining issues of foreign funding, human rights abuses, and international alliances present a complex challenge for policymakers. As the U.S. grapples with its role in the Middle East and its relationships with countries like Saudi Arabia, the calls for accountability and ethical governance resonate louder than ever. The ongoing situation demands a critical examination of the implications of these alliances, particularly in light of the pressing humanitarian crises that continue to unfold.",-30.0,-30.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,646.0,-1.3043478260869565,-0.04643962848297214
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the 2016 election season was characterized by intense exchanges between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump. The debate, held in front of a national audience, showcased the candidates' contrasting views and strategies as they vied for the presidency.

NBC moderator Lester Holt faced significant criticism for his handling of the debate, particularly for his tendency to interrupt Trump in order to ""fact-check"" his statements. Many observers noted that several of Holt's fact-checks were inaccurate, raising questions about the fairness of the moderation. A particularly contentious moment arose when Holt asserted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from its inception, a claim that Trump firmly denied. This exchange highlighted the differing narratives surrounding the candidates' positions on foreign policy.

Critics pointed out that while Holt focused heavily on Trump's past statements regarding the Iraq War, he did not pose similar questions to Clinton about her vote in favor of the war. This perceived bias in questioning fueled further discontent among Trump's supporters, who felt that the debate was not conducted equitably.

In the aftermath of the debate, an interview surfaced in which Trump expressed his reservations about the invasion of Iraq. This revelation contradicted Holt's assertions during the debate and suggested that Trump had advocated for a more cautious approach, including waiting for the United Nations and questioning then-President George W. Bush's decision to invade. This inconsistency raised further doubts about the accuracy of the moderator's claims and the overall narrative being pushed by the mainstream media.

The debate also served as a platform for Trump to assertively confront both Clinton and the media. Supporters praised him for effectively standing up to the challenges posed by his opponent and the moderator, framing his performance as a demonstration of strength and resilience. Trump's ability to navigate the heated exchanges was noted as a key aspect of his debate strategy, as he sought to reinforce his position as a strong alternative to Clinton.

As the debate concluded, discussions surrounding the candidates' performances continued to dominate headlines. The stark differences between Clinton and Trump were on full display, and the contentious nature of the debate underscored the high stakes of the upcoming election. The reactions to Holt's moderation and the candidates' exchanges suggest that the debate will be remembered not only for the issues discussed but also for the way it was conducted, highlighting the ongoing tensions between political figures and the media in today's polarized climate.",-9.0,-1.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,472.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.00211864406779661
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The Birther movement, which questioned the legitimacy of Barack Obama’s presidency, continues to provoke discussions about bias and the implications of past representations of the former president. A recent analysis delves into a 2004 article by the Associated Press (AP) that referred to Obama as ""Kenyan-born"" during his campaign for the Illinois Senate seat, raising questions about the narratives surrounding his birthplace.

At the time, Obama was emerging as a significant candidate, especially following the withdrawal of his main rival, Jack Ryan, due to scandalous allegations. This shift in the political landscape allowed Obama to gain a clear lead in the race. However, the AP's characterization of Obama as ""Kenyan-born"" has since been scrutinized, particularly because Obama never publicly refuted this claim, which remains accessible online.

Adding to the complexity of the situation is a promotional booklet from 1991, produced by Obama’s literary agency, which described him as ""born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii."" This booklet was intended for business colleagues in the publishing industry and included biographies of various authors, including Obama. The existence of this document has fueled speculation about the consistency of Obama’s narrative regarding his birthplace and citizenship.

The article raises critical questions about the implications of these claims. If Obama’s assertion of being born in America is indeed valid, then the reference to him being ""Kenyan-born"" could be interpreted as a manipulation for personal gain or as a means to create a compelling backstory. This notion leads to further inquiries about the integrity of both claims: if one is false, the other must also be scrutinized, particularly in the context of his eligibility for the presidency.

The implications of such contradictions are significant, as they touch upon issues of identity, legitimacy, and the political landscape that allowed the Birther movement to flourish. The ongoing discussions surrounding these narratives highlight the intersection of media representation, political ambition, and public perception.

In conclusion, the examination of the Birther movement and its implications concerning Barack Obama’s birthplace continues to resonate in contemporary political discourse. The questions raised about bias and the consistency of Obama’s narrative serve as a reminder of the complexities inherent in political identity and the narratives that shape public figures. As the discourse evolves, the legacy of these discussions remains a pivotal aspect of understanding the challenges faced by Obama during and after his presidency.",-18.0,-5.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,471.0,-0.3125,-0.010615711252653927

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In the wake of a recent debate, concerns have emerged regarding potential bias from the moderator, particularly favoring Hillary Clinton. Observers have noted that Clinton appeared notably composed throughout the debate, lacking any visible signs of distress, such as coughing, and showcased a readiness with detailed answers to the questions posed. However, this poise has not been without its controversies.

Social media platforms buzzed with speculation about a possible flesh-colored device that appeared in Clinton's ear during the debate. This led to a flurry of discussions among Twitter users, who debated whether the object was an earpiece or merely a fashionable accessory. Some users humorously suggested it could be a ""Cough prevention machine,"" while others speculated that it might simply be a trick of the light.

Despite the swirling rumors, Hillary Clinton's campaign has firmly denied the presence of any earpiece. Campaign representatives attributed the appearance of the device to reflections caused by the studio lighting used during the debate. This explanation, however, has done little to quell the speculation. An email exchange between Clinton and her close aide, Huma Abedin, surfaced, which referenced an earpiece, further igniting discussions and theories surrounding the topic.

Critics have taken to social media to voice their opinions, with notable figures chiming in. A tweet from Woods criticized Clinton, suggesting that she requires assistance to effectively convey her messages. This tweet, among others, has contributed to the ongoing discourse about the authenticity and transparency of Clinton's debate performance.

As the debate continues, it is important to note that no conclusive evidence has been presented to support the claims of an earpiece. Many observers have pointed out that the appearance of the device may well be attributed to the lighting setup in the studio, which can create illusions that mislead viewers. This lack of solid evidence has left the conversation open-ended, with both supporters and detractors of Clinton continuing to share their perspectives.

The debate has not only raised questions about Clinton's performance but has also highlighted the broader issues of media bias and the scrutiny faced by candidates in high-stakes political environments. As the election season progresses, the implications of this debate and the surrounding discussions will likely play a significant role in shaping public perception.

In summary, the recent debate has sparked significant controversy over claims of moderator bias favoring Hillary Clinton, alongside speculation about a potential earpiece. While Clinton's campaign has denied these claims, the discussion continues to thrive on social media, fueled by both skepticism and support. As the narrative unfolds, it remains to be seen how these debates will influence the political landscape in the lead-up to the election.",-5.0,-12.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,509.0,-0.5714285714285714,-0.023575638506876228
